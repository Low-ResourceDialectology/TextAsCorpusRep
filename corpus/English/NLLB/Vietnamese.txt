Harold Lloyd would move away from tragicomic personas, and portray an everyman with unwavering confidence and optimism.
To create his new character Lloyd donned a pair of lensless horn-rimmed glasses but wore normal clothing; previously, he had worn a fake mustache and ill-fitting clothes as the Chaplinesque "Lonesome Luke". "
They were natural and the romance could be believable."
On Sunday, August 24, 1919, while posing for some promotional still photographs in the Los Angeles Witzel Photography Studio, he picked up what he thought was a prop bomb and lit it with a cigarette.
Lloyd was in the act of lighting a cigarette from the fuse of the bomb when it exploded, also badly burning his face and chest and injuring his eye.

On March 23, 1937, Lloyd sold the land of his studio, Harold Lloyd Motion Picture Company, to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
He returned for an additional starring appearance in The Sin of Harold Diddlebock, an ill-fated homage to Lloyd's career, directed by Preston Sturges and financed by Howard Hughes.

Many years later, acetate discs of 29 of the shows were discovered in Lloyd's home, and they now circulate among old-time radio collectors.
He was a Past Potentate of Al-Malaikah Shrine in Los Angeles, and was eventually selected as Imperial Potentate of the Shriners of North America for the year 1949–50.

They've come close to it, but they haven't come all the way up".
In the early 1960s, Lloyd produced two compilation films, featuring scenes from his old comedies, Harold Lloyd's World of Comedy and The Funny Side of Life.
Time-Life released several of the feature films more or less intact, also using some of Scharf's scores which had been commissioned by Lloyd.
The Brownlow and Gill documentary was shown as part of the PBS series American Masters, and created a renewed interest in Lloyd's work in the United States, but the films were largely unavailable.
They also adopted Gloria Freeman (1924–1986) in September 1930, whom they renamed Marjorie Elizabeth Lloyd but was known as "Peggy" for most of her life.
Davis died from a heart attack in 1969, two years before Lloyd's death.
In 1925, at the height of his movie career, Lloyd entered into Freemasonry at the Alexander Hamilton Lodge No.
In 1926, he became a 32° Scottish Rite Mason in the Valley of Los Angeles, California.
A portion of Lloyd's personal inventory of his silent films (then estimated to be worth $2 million) was destroyed in August 1943 when his film vault caught fire.
The fire spared the main house and outbuildings.
Lloyd was honored in 1960 for his contribution to motion pictures with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 1503 Vine Street.
The second citation was a snub to Chaplin, who at that point had fallen foul of McCarthyism and had his entry visa to the United States revoked.
Gladys Marie Smith (April 8, 1892 – May 29, 1979), known professionally as Mary Pickford, was a Canadian-American film actress and producer with a career that spanned five decades.
Her father, John Charles Smith was the son of English Methodist immigrants, and worked a variety of odd jobs.
To please her husband's relatives, Pickford's mother baptized her children as Methodists, the religion of their father.
Gladys, her mother and two younger siblings toured the United States by rail, performing in third-rate companies and plays.
Gladys finally landed a supporting role in a 1907 Broadway play, The Warrens of Virginia.
After completing the Broadway run and touring the play, however, Pickford was again out of work.
She quickly grasped that movie acting was simpler than the stylized stage acting of the day.
As Pickford said of her success at Biograph:I played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities ... I decided that if I could get into as many pictures as possible, I'd become known, and there would be a demand for my work.
In January 1910, Pickford traveled with a Biograph crew to Los Angeles.
Actors were not listed in the credits in Griffith's company.
Pickford left Biograph in December 1910.
She returned to Broadway in the David Belasco production of A Good Little Devil (1912).
In 1913, she decided to work exclusively in film.
Pickford left the stage to join Zukor's roster of stars.
Comedy-dramas, such as In the Bishop's Carriage (1913), Caprice (1913), and especially Hearts Adrift (1914), made her irresistible to moviegoers.
Tess of the Storm Country was released five weeks later.
Only Charlie Chaplin, who slightly surpassed Pickford's popularity in 1916, had a similarly spellbinding pull with critics and the audience.
She also became vice-president of Pickford Film Corporation.
Due to her lack of a normal childhood, she enjoyed making these pictures.
In August 1918, Pickford's contract expired and, when refusing Zukor's terms for a renewal, she was offered $250,000 to leave the motion picture business.
Through United Artists, Pickford continued to produce and perform in her own movies; she could also distribute them as she chose.
During this period, she also made Little Annie Rooney (1925), another film in which Pickford played a child, Sparrows (1926), which blended the Dickensian with newly minted German expressionist style, and My Best Girl (1927), a romantic comedy featuring her future husband Charles "Buddy" Rogers.
She played a reckless socialite in Coquette (1929), her first talkie, a role for which her famous ringlets were cut into a 1920s' bob.
The public failed to respond to her in the more sophisticated roles.
Established Hollywood actors were panicked by the impending arrival of the talkies.
She retired from film acting in 1933 following three costly failures with her last film appearance being Secrets.
During World War I she promoted the sale of Liberty Bonds, making an intensive series of fund-raising speeches, beginning in Washington, D.C., where she sold bonds alongside Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Theda Bara, and Marie Dressler.
In a single speech in Chicago, she sold an estimated five million dollars' worth of bonds.
At the end of World War I, Pickford conceived of the Motion Picture Relief Fund, an organization to help financially needy actors.
As a result, in 1940, the Fund was able to purchase land and build the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital, in Woodland Hills, California.
She demanded (and received) these powers in 1916, when she was under contract to Zukor's Famous Players in Famous Plays (later Paramount).
The Mary Pickford Corporation was briefly Pickford's motion-picture production company.
Distributors (also part of the studios) arranged for company productions to be shown in the company's movie venues.
It was solely a distribution company, offering independent film producers access to its own screens as well as the rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies.
As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood.
She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades.
It is rumored she became pregnant by Moore in the early 1910s and had a miscarriage or an abortion.
The couple lived together on-and-off for several years.
Around this time, Pickford also suffered from the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic.
They went to Europe for their honeymoon; fans in London and in Paris caused riots trying to get to the famous couple.
Pickford continued to epitomize the virtuous but fiery girl next door.
Foreign heads of state and dignitaries who visited the White House often asked if they could also visit Pickfair, the couple's mansion in Beverly Hills.
Other guests included George Bernard Shaw, Albert Einstein, Elinor Glyn, Helen Keller, H. G. Wells, Lord Mountbatten, Fritz Kreisler, Amelia Earhart, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Noël Coward, Max Reinhardt, Baron Nishi, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Austen Chamberlain, Sir Harry Lauder, and Meher Baba, among others.
They were also constantly on display as America's unofficial ambassadors to the world, leading parades, cutting ribbons, and making speeches.
They divorced January 10, 1936.
She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie's small stature and Roxanne's crooked teeth.
Her siblings, Lottie and Jack, both died of alcohol-related causes in 1936 and 1933, respectively.
Pickford withdrew and gradually became a recluse, remaining almost entirely at Pickfair and allowing visits only from Lillian Gish, her stepson Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and few other people.
She appeared in court in 1959, in a matter pertaining to her co-ownership of North Carolina TV station WSJS-TV.
Charles "Buddy" Rogers often gave guests tours of Pickfair, including views of a genuine western bar Pickford had bought for Douglas Fairbanks, and a portrait of Pickford in the drawing room.
She also owned a house in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Her handprints and footprints are displayed at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California.
The Mary Pickford Theater at the James Madison Memorial Building of the Library of Congress is named in her honor.
A first-run movie theatre in Cathedral City, California is called The Mary Pickford Theatre, which was established on May 25, 2001.
Among them are a rare and spectacular beaded gown she wore in the film Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall (1924) designed by Mitchell Leisen, her special Oscar, and a jewelry box.
The family home had been demolished in 1943, and many of the bricks delivered to Pickford in California.
In 1993, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her.
From January 2011 until July 2011, the Toronto International Film Festival exhibited a collection of Mary Pickford memorabilia in the Canadian Film Gallery of the TIFF Bell LightBox building.
It was donated to Keene State College and is currently undergoing restoration by the Library of Congress for exhibition.
The Google Doodle of April 8, 2017 commemorated Mary Pickford's 125th birthday.
Gloria Josephine May Swanson (March 27, 1899 – April 4, 1983) was an American actress, producer, and businesswoman.
Her schoolgirl crush on Essanay Studios actor Francis X. Bushman led to her aunt taking her to tour the actor's Chicago studio.
Her sound film debut performance in the 1929 The Trespasser, earned her a second Academy Award nomination.
Her father was a Swedish American and her mother was of German, French, and Polish ancestry.
In either version, she was soon hired as an extra.
Her first role was a brief walk-on with actress Gerda Holmes, that paid an enormous (in those days) $3.25.
In 1915, she co-starred in Sweedie Goes to College with her future first husband Wallace Beery.
Vernon and Swanson projected a great screen chemistry that proved popular with audiences.
Badger was sufficiently impressed by Swanson to recommend her to the director Jack Conway for Her Decision and You Can't Believe Everything in 1918.
1920), Something to Think About (1920), and The Affairs of Anatol (1921) soon followed.
He had become a star in 1921 for his appearance in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, but Swanson had known him since his days as an aspiring actor getting small parts, with no seeming hope for his professional future.
Filming was allowed for the first time at many of the historic sites relating to Napoleon.
At the time, Swanson was considered the most bankable star of her era.
The production was a disaster, with Parker being indecisive and the actors not experienced enough to deliver the performances she wanted.
The members took further steps by registering their discontent with Will H. Hays, Chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America.
Hays was enthusiastic about the basic story, but did have specific issues that were dealt with before the film's release.
He proposed to personally bankroll her next picture and conducted a thorough examination of her financial records.
Kennedy, however, advised her to hire Erich von Stroheim to direct another silent film, The Swamp, subsequently retitled Queen Kelly.
Stroheim worked for several months on writing the basic script.
Shooting was shut down in January, and Stroheim fired, after complaints by Swanson about him and about the general direction the film was taking.
The Trespasser in 1929 was a sound production, and garnered Swanson her second Oscar nomination.
The world premiere was held in London, the first American sound production to do so.
Perfect Understanding, a 1933 sound production comedy, was the only film produced by this company.
She began appearing in stage productions and starred in The Gloria Swanson Hour on WPIX-TV in 1948.
The storyline of the film follows a faded silent movie actress Norma Desmond (Swanson), in love with a failed screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden).
Norma plays a card game of bridge with a group of actors also known as "the Waxworks".
Norma dreams of a comeback are subverted, and when Gillis tries to break up with her, she threatens to kill herself, but instead kills him.
Although Swanson had objected to enduring a screen test for the film, she had been glad to be making much more money than she had been in television and on stage.
Swanson later hosted Crown Theatre with Gloria Swanson, a television anthology series in which she occasionally acted.
She was the "mystery guest" on What's My Line.
She made a notable appearance in a 1966 episode of The Beverly Hillbillies, in which she plays herself.
Actor and playwright Harold J. Kennedy, who had learned the ropes at Yale and with Orson Wells' Mercury Theatre, suggested Swanson do a road tour of "Reflected Glory", a comedy that had run on the Broadway stage with Tallulah Bankhead as its star.
After her success with Sunset Boulevard, she starred on Broadway in a revival of Twentieth Century with José Ferrer, and in Nina with David Niven.
As a Republican she supported the 1940 and 1944 campaigns for president of Wendell Willkie and the 1964 presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater.
Taking medication given to her by Beery, purported to be for morning sickness, she aborted the fetus and was taken unconscious to the hospital.
In 1923, she adopted 1-year-old Sonny Smith, whom she renamed Joseph Patrick Swanson after her father.
She had conceived a child with him before her divorce from Somborn was final, a situation that would have led to a public scandal and possible end of her film career.
Following a four-month recuperation from her abortion, they returned to the United States as European nobility.
He became a film executive representing Pathé (USA) in France.
Swanson described herself as a "mental vampire", someone with a searching curiosity about how things worked, and who pursued the possibilities of turning those ideas into reality.
They met by chance in Paris when Swanson was being fitted by Coco Chanel for her 1931 film Tonight or Never.
Her friends, some of whom openly disliked him, thought she was making a mistake.
Swanson had initially thought she was going to be able to retire from acting, but the marriage was troubled by Davey's alcoholism from the start.
He was the co-author (ghostwriter) of Billie Holiday's autobiography Lady Sings the Blues, the author of Sugar Blues, a 1975 best-selling health book still in print, and the author of the English version of Georges Ohsawa's You Are All Sanpaku.
Swanson and her husband first got to know John Lennon and Yoko Ono because they were fans of Dufty's work.
She was cremated and her ashes interred at the Episcopal Church of the Heavenly Rest on Fifth Avenue in New York City, attended by only a small circle of family.
In 1974, Swanson was one of the honorees of the first Telluride Film Festival.
Due to the erotic nature of her performances, Nielsen's films were censored in the United States, and her work remained relatively obscure to American audiences.
Nielsen's family moved several times during her childhood while her father sought employment.
Nielsen's father died when she was fourteen years old.
In 1901, 21-year-old Nielsen became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter, Jesta.
Nielsen graduated from the Theater school in 1902.
Nielsen's minimalist acting style was evidenced in her successful portrayal of a naive young woman lured into a tragic life.
Nielsen and Gad married, then made four more films together.
I realised that the age of short film was past.
It was international film sales that provided Union with eight Nielsen films per year.
I used every available means – and devised many new ones – in order to bring the Asta Nielsen films to the world."
In a Russian popularity poll of 1911, Nielsen was voted the world's top female movie star, behind Linder and ahead of her Danish compatriot Valdemar Psilander.
In 1921, Nielsen, through her own film distribution company of Asta Films, appeared in the Svend Gade and Heinz Schall directed Hamlet.
However, scholarly works such as the authoritative filmography published by Filmarchiv Austria in 2010 make no mention of such a film.
She worked in German films until the start of sound movies.
Thereafter, Nielsen acted only on stage.
Understanding the implications, Nielsen declined and left Germany in 1936.
They were divorced by 1919 when Nielsen married the Swedish shipbuilder Freddy Windgårdh.
They began a long-term common-law marriage that lasted from 1923 until the late 1930s.
Fred Astaire (born Frederick Austerlitz; May 10, 1899 – June 22, 1987) was an American dancer, actor, singer, choreographer, and television presenter.
He starred in more than 10 Broadway and West End musicals, made 31 musical films, four television specials, and numerous recordings.
Astaire's mother was born in the US to Lutheran German immigrants from East Prussia and Alsace.
Fritz was seeking work in the brewing trade and moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he was employed by the Storz Brewing Company.
Johanna planned a "brother and sister act", common in vaudeville at the time, for her two children.
They began training at the Alviene Master School of the Theatre and Academy of Cultural Arts.
They were taught dance, speaking, and singing in preparation for developing an act.
In an interview, Astaire's daughter, Ava Astaire McKenzie, observed that they often put Fred in a top hat to make him look taller.
As a result of their father's salesmanship, Fred and Adele landed a major contract and played the Orpheum Circuit in the Midwest, Western and some Southern cities in the US.
In 1912, Fred became an Episcopalian.
From vaudeville dancer Aurelio Coccia, they learned the tango, waltz, and other ballroom dances popularized by Vernon and Irene Castle.
He first met George Gershwin, who was working as a song plugger for Jerome H. Remick's music publishing company, in 1916.
Of their work in The Passing Show of 1918, Heywood Broun wrote: "In an evening in which there was an abundance of good dancing, Fred Astaire stood out ... He and his partner, Adele Astaire, made the show pause early in the evening with a beautiful loose-limbed dance."
But by this time, Astaire's dancing skill was beginning to outshine his sister's.
Astaire's tap dancing was recognized by then as among the best.
After the close of Funny Face, the Astaires went to Hollywood for a screen test (now lost) at Paramount Pictures, but Paramount deemed them unsuitable for films.
The end of the partnership was traumatic for Astaire but stimulated him to expand his range.
They lent him for a few days to MGM in 1933 for his significant Hollywood debut in the successful musical film Dancing Lady.
He wrote his agent, "I don't mind making another picture with her, but as for this 'team' idea, it's 'out!'
The partnership, and the choreography of Astaire and Hermes Pan, helped make dancing an important element of the Hollywood film musical.
Six out of the nine Astaire–Rogers musicals became the biggest moneymakers for RKO; all of the films brought a certain prestige and artistry that all studios coveted at the time.
This gave the illusion of an almost stationary camera filming an entire dance in a single shot.
Astaire's style of dance sequences allowed the viewer to follow the dancers and choreography in their entirety.
Astaire's second innovation involved the context of the dance; he was adamant that all song and dance routines be integral to the plotlines of the film.
One would be a solo performance by Astaire, which he termed his "sock solo."
I think Ginger Rogers was.
She faked it an awful lot.
In 1976, British talk-show host Sir Michael Parkinson asked Astaire who his favorite dancing partner was on Parkinson.
Despite their success, Astaire was unwilling to have his career tied exclusively to any partnership.
Throughout this period, Astaire continued to value the input of choreographic collaborators.
They starred in Broadway Melody of 1940, in which they performed a celebrated extended dance routine to Cole Porter's "Begin the Beguine."
He played alongside Bing Crosby in Holiday Inn (1942) and later Blue Skies (1946).
The latter film featured "Puttin' On the Ritz", an innovative song-and-dance routine indelibly associated with him.
The first film, You'll Never Get Rich (1941), catapulted Hayworth to stardom.
It featured a duet to Kern's "I'm Old Fashioned," which became the centerpiece of Jerome Robbins's 1983 New York City Ballet tribute to Astaire.
Astaire choreographed this film alone and achieved modest box office success.
The fantasy Yolanda and the Thief (1945) featured an avant-garde surrealistic ballet.
Always insecure and believing his career was beginning to falter, Astaire surprised his audiences by announcing his retirement during the production of his next film Blue Skies (1946).
Both of these films revived Astaire's popularity and in 1950 he starred in two musicals.
While Three Little Words did quite well at the box office, Let's Dance was a financial disappointment.
But because of its high cost, it failed to make a profit on its first release.
Then, his wife Phyllis became ill and suddenly died of lung cancer.
Daddy Long Legs only did moderately well at the box office.
Similarly, Astaire's next project – his final musical at MGM, Silk Stockings (1957), in which he co-starred with Cyd Charisse, also lost money at the box office.
The first of these programs, 1958's An Evening with Fred Astaire, won nine Emmy Awards, including "Best Single Performance by an Actor" and "Most Outstanding Single Program of the Year."
The choice had a controversial backlash because many believed his dancing in the special was not the type of "acting" for which the award was designed.
They restored the original videotape, transferring its contents to a modern format and filling in gaps where the tape had deteriorated with kinescope footage.
Astaire appeared in non-dancing roles in three other films and several television series from 1957 to 1969.
Astaire's dance partner was Petula Clark, who played his character's skeptical daughter.
Astaire continued to act in the 1970s.
In the second compilation, aged seventy-six, he performed brief dance linking sequences with Kelly, his last dance performances in a musical film.
In 1978, he co-starred with Helen Hayes in a well received television film A Family Upside Down in which they played an elderly couple coping with failing health.
Astaire asked his agent to obtain a role for him on Galactica because of his grandchildren's interest in the series and the producers were delighted at the opportunity to create an entire episode to feature him.
Long after the photography for the solo dance number "I Want to Be a Dancin' Man" was completed for the 1952 feature The Belle of New York, it was decided that Astaire's humble costume and the threadbare stage set were inadequate and the entire sequence was reshot.
Frame for frame, the two performances are identical, down to the subtlest gesture.
His was a uniquely recognizable dance style that greatly influenced the American Smooth style of ballroom dance and set standards against which subsequent film dance musicals would be judged.
He notes Astaire's dance style was consistent in subsequent films made with or without the assistance of Pan.
However, this was almost always confined to the area of extended fantasy sequences, or "dream ballets".
Later in life, he admitted, "I had to do most of it myself."
Many dance routines were built around a "gimmick," like dancing on the walls in Royal Wedding or dancing with his shadows in Swing Time.
They would work with a rehearsal pianist (often the composer Hal Borne) who in turn would communicate modifications to the musical orchestrators.
With all the preparation completed, the actual shooting would go quickly, conserving costs.
He will not even go to see his rushes... He always thinks he is no good."
Michael Kidd, Astaire's co-choreographer on the 1953 film The Band Wagon, found that his own concern about the emotional motivation behind the dance was not shared by Astaire.
Let's add the looks later.' "
Irving Berlin considered Astaire the equal of any male interpreter of his songs—"as good as Jolson, Crosby or Sinatra, not necessarily because of his voice, but for his conception of projecting a song.
In his heyday, Astaire was referenced in lyrics of songwriters Cole Porter, Lorenz Hart and Eric Maschwitz and continues to inspire modern songwriters.
During 1952, Astaire recorded The Astaire Story, a four-volume album with a quintet led by Oscar Peterson.
Bogart began acting in Broadway shows, beginning his career in motion pictures with Up the River (1930) for Fox and appeared in supporting roles for the next decade, sometimes portraying gangsters.
Bogart's private detectives, Sam Spade (in The Maltese Falcon) and Phillip Marlowe (in 1946's The Big Sleep), became the models for detectives in other noir films.
Soon after the principal photography for The Big Sleep (1946, their second film together), he filed for divorce from his third wife and married Bacall.
He reprised those unsettled, unstable characters as a World War II naval-vessel commander in The Caine Mutiny (1954), which was a critical and commercial hit and earned him another Best Actor nomination.
The name "Bogart" derives from the Dutch surname, "Bogaert".
Maud was an Episcopalian of English heritage, and a descendant of Mayflower passenger John Howland.
Clifford McCarty wrote that Warner Bros. publicity department had altered it to January 23, 1900 "to foster the view that a man born on Christmas Day couldn't really be as villainous as he appeared to be on screen".
Lauren Bacall wrote in her autobiography that Bogart's birthday was always celebrated on Christmas Day, saying that he joked about being cheated out of a present every year.
Maud was a commercial illustrator who received her art training in New York and France, including study with James Abbott McNeill Whistler.
She earned over $50,000 a year at the peak of her career – a very large sum of money at the time, and considerably more than her husband's $20,000.
He had two younger sisters: Frances ("Pat") and Catherine Elizabeth ("Kay").
A kiss, in our family, was an event.
He inherited a tendency to needle, a fondness for fishing, a lifelong love of boating, and an attraction to strong-willed women from his father.
Bogart later attended Phillips Academy, a boarding school to which he was admitted based on family connections.
Several reasons have been given; according to one, he was expelled for throwing the headmaster (or a groundskeeper) into Rabbit Pond on campus.
He then volunteered for the Coast Guard Temporary Reserve in 1944, patrolling the California coastline in his yacht, the Santana.
In one, his lip was cut by shrapnel when his ship (the ) was shelled.
While changing trains in Boston, the handcuffed prisoner reportedly asked Bogart for a cigarette.
By the time Bogart was treated by a doctor, a scar had formed.
Instead of stitching it up, he screwed it up."
His character and values developed separately from his family during his navy days, and he began to rebel.
Bogart resumed his friendship with Bill Brady Jr. (whose father had show-business connections), and obtained an office job with William A. Brady's new World Films company.
He made his stage debut a few months later as a Japanese butler in Alice's 1921 play Drifting (nervously delivering one line of dialogue), and appeared in several of her subsequent plays.
A barroom brawl at this time was also a purported cause of Bogart's lip damage, dovetailing with Louise Brooks' account.
Bogart disliked his trivial, effeminate early-career parts, calling them "White Pants Willie" roles.
Menken said in her divorce filing that Bogart valued his career more than marriage, citing neglect and abuse.
There he met Spencer Tracy, a Broadway actor whom Bogart liked and admired, and they became close friends and drinking companions.
Tracy received top billing, but Bogart appeared on the film's posters.
A quarter of a century later, the two men planned to make The Desperate Hours together.
Bogart shuttled back and forth between Hollywood and the New York stage from 1930 to 1935, out of work for long periods.
Although Leslie Howard was the star, The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson said that the play was "a peach ... a roaring Western melodrama ... Humphrey Bogart does the best work of his career as an actor."
Warner Bros. bought the screen rights to The Petrified Forest in 1935.
Howard, who held the production rights, made it clear that he wanted Bogart to star with him.
When Warner Bros. saw that Howard would not budge, they gave in and cast Bogart.
According to Variety, "Bogart's menace leaves nothing wanting".
There must be something in my tone of voice, or this arrogant face—something that antagonizes everybody.
Bogart used these years to begin developing his film persona: a wounded, stoical, cynical, charming, vulnerable, self-mocking loner with a code of honor.
His disputes with Warner Bros. over roles and money were similar to those waged by the studio with more established and less malleable stars such as Bette Davis and James Cagney.
His only leading role during this period was in Dead End (1937, on loan to Samuel Goldwyn), as a gangster modeled after Baby Face Nelson.
In Black Legion (1937), a movie Graham Greene described as "intelligent and exciting, if rather earnest", he played a good man who was caught up with (and destroyed by) a racist organization.
The trouble was they were drinking mine and I was making this stinking movie."
On August 21, 1938, Bogart entered a turbulent third marriage to actress Mayo Methot, a lively, friendly woman when sober but paranoid and aggressive when drunk.
She set their house afire, stabbed him with a knife, and slashed her wrists several times.
According to their friend, Julius Epstein, "The Bogart-Methot marriage was the sequel to the Civil War".
Methot's influence was increasingly destructive, however, and Bogart also continued to drink.
When he thought an actor, director or studio had done something shoddy, he spoke up publicly about it.
Paul Muni, George Raft, Cagney and Robinson turned down the lead role, giving Bogart the opportunity to play a character with some depth.
He worked well with Ida Lupino, sparking jealousy from Mayo Methot.
He could quote Plato, Pope, Ralph Waldo Emerson and over a thousand lines of Shakespeare, and subscribed to the Harvard Law Review.
Based on the Dashiell Hammett novel, it was first serialized in the pulp magazine Black Mask in 1929 and was the basis of two earlier film versions; the second was Satan Met a Lady (1936), starring Bette Davis.
Huston then eagerly accepted Bogart as his Sam Spade.
The film, directed by Michael Curtiz and produced by Hal Wallis, featured Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson.
Bogart is reported to have been responsible for the notion that Rick Blaine should be portrayed as a chess player, a metaphor for the relationships he maintained with friends, enemies, and allies.
Bogart was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role, but lost to Paul Lukas for his performance in Watch on the Rhine.
Bogart went on United Service Organizations and War Bond tours with Methot in 1943 and 1944, making arduous trips to Italy and North Africa (including Casablanca).
When they met, Bacall was 19 and Bogart 44; he nicknamed her "Baby."
We'll have a lot of fun together".
By Myself and Then Some, HarperCollins, New York, 2005.
He considered himself Bacall's protector and mentor, and Bogart was usurping that role.
Also, he has a sense of humor that contains that grating undertone of contempt."
The dialogue, especially in the added scenes supplied by Hawks, was full of sexual innuendo, and Bogart is convincing as private detective Philip Marlowe.
The marriage was a happy one, with tensions due to their differences.
According to Bogart's biographer, Stefan Kanfer, it was "a production line film noir with no particular distinction".
Lacking a love interest or a happy ending, it was considered a risky project.
James Agee wrote, "Bogart does a wonderful job with this character ... miles ahead of the very good work he has done before."
Bogart appeared in his final films for Warners, Chain Lightning (1950) and The Enforcer (1951).
Santana also made two films without him: And Baby Makes Three (1949) and The Family Secret (1951).
Several Bogart biographers, and actress-writer Louise Brooks, have felt that this role is closest to the real Bogart.
A parody of sorts of The Maltese Falcon, Beat the Devil was the final film for Bogart and John Huston.
Huston's love of adventure, his deep, longstanding friendship (and success) with Bogart, and the chance to work with Hepburn convinced the actor to leave Hollywood for a difficult shoot on location in the Belgian Congo.
Bacall came for the over-four-month duration, leaving their young son in Los Angeles.
She Luxed my undies in darkest Africa."
Hepburn (a teetotaler) fared worse in the difficult conditions, losing weight and at one point becoming very ill.
Despite the discomfort of jumping from the boat into swamps, rivers and marshes, The African Queen apparently rekindled Bogart's early love of boats; when he returned to California, he bought a classic mahogany Hacker-Craft runabout which he kept until his death.
When Bogart won, however, he said: "It's a long way from the Belgian Congo to the stage of this theatre.
As in tennis, you need a good opponent or partner to bring out the best in you.
Though he retained some of his old bitterness about having to do so, he delivered a strong performance in the lead; he received his final Oscar nomination and was the subject of a June 7, 1954 Time magazine cover story.
He is the type of director I don't like to work with ... the picture is a crock of crap.
Despite the acrimony, the film was successful; according to a review in The New York Times, Bogart was "incredibly adroit ... the skill with which this old rock-ribbed actor blends the gags and such duplicities with a manly manner of melting is one of the incalculable joys of the show".
He was uneasy with Ava Gardner in the female lead; she had just broken up with his Rat Pack buddy Frank Sinatra, and Bogart was annoyed by her inexperienced performance.
When Bacall found them together, she extracted an expensive shopping spree from her husband; the three traveled together after the shooting.
He also appeared on The Jack Benny Show, where a surviving kinescope of the live telecast captures him in his only TV sketch-comedy performance (October 25, 1953).
Stephen became an author and biographer and hosted a television special about his father on Turner Classic Movies.
In the wake of Santana, Bogart had formed a new company and had plans for a film (Melville Goodwin, U.S.A.) in which he would play a general and Bacall a press magnate.
He did not talk about his health and visited a doctor in January 1956 after considerable persuasion from Bacall.
He had additional surgery in November 1956, when the cancer had metastasized.
On it was inscribed, "If you want anything, just whistle."
Having studied with Stella Adler in the 1940s, he is credited with being one of the first actors to bring the Stanislavski system of acting and method acting, derived from the Stanislavski system, to mainstream audiences.
He directed and starred in the cult western One-Eyed Jacks, a critical and commercial flop, after which he delivered a series of notable box-office failures, beginning with Mutiny on the Bounty (1962).
He refused the award due to alleged mistreatment and misportrayal of Native Americans by Hollywood.
According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Brando was paid a record $3.7 million ($ million in inflation-adjusted dollars) and 11.75% of the gross profits for 13 days' work on Superman.
His ancestry was mostly German, Dutch, English, and Irish.
Brando was raised a Christian Scientist.
However, she was an alcoholic and often had to be brought home from bars in Chicago by her husband.
Brando harbored far more enmity for his father, stating, "I was his namesake, but nothing I did ever pleased or even interested him.
Around 1930, Brando's parents moved to Evanston, Illinois, when his father's work took him to Chicago, but separated in 1935 when Brando was 11 years old.
Brando, whose childhood nickname was "Bud", was a mimic from his youth.
In the 2007 TCM biopic Brando: The Documentary, childhood friend George Englund recalls Brando's earliest acting as imitating the cows and horses on the family farm as a way to distract his mother from drinking.
Brando's sister Frances left college in California to study art in New York.
Brando excelled at theater and did well in the school.
The faculty voted to expel him, though he was supported by the students, who thought expulsion was too harsh.
In a 1988 documentary, Marlon Brando: The Wild One, Brando's sister Jocelyn remembered, "He was in a school play and enjoyed it ... So he decided he would go to New York and study acting because that was the only thing he had enjoyed.
For a time he lived with Roy Somlyo, who later became a four time Emmy winning Broadway producer.
Brando's remarkable insight and sense of realism were evident early on.
According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action.
His behavior had him kicked out of the cast of the New School's production in Sayville, but he was soon afterwards discovered in a locally produced play there.
Cornell also cast him as the Messenger in her production of Jean Anouilh's Antigone that same year.
Bankhead had turned down the role of Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named Desire, which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946–1947 season.
Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando's behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening. "
It was marvelous," a cast member recalled. "
Critics were not as kind, however.
He received better reviews at subsequent tour stops, but what his colleagues recalled was only occasional indications of the talent he would later demonstrate. "
Brando displayed his apathy for the production by demonstrating some shocking onstage manners.
After several weeks on the road, they reached Boston, by which time Bankhead was ready to dismiss him.
Pierpont writes that John Garfield was first choice for the role, but "made impossible demands."
It humanizes the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality and callousness of youth rather than a vicious old man ... A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard."
He said, "The curtain went up and on the stage is that son of a bitch from the gym, and he's playing me."
Brando's first screen role was a bitter paraplegic veteran in The Men (1950).
By Brando's own account, it may have been because of this film that his draft status was changed from 4-F to 1-A. He had had surgery on his trick knee, and it was no longer physically debilitating enough to incur exclusion from the draft.
Coincidentally, the psychiatrist knew a doctor friend of Brando.
The role is regarded as one of Brando's greatest.
The film was directed by Elia Kazan and co-starred Anthony Quinn.
During our scenes together, I sensed a bitterness toward me, and if I suggested a drink after work, he either turned me down or else was sullen and said little.
After achieving the desired effect, Kazan never told Quinn that he had misled him.
Gielgud was so impressed that he offered Brando a full season at the Hammersmith Theatre, an offer he declined.
It was like a furnace door opening—the heat came off the screen.
By all accounts, Brando was upset by his mentor's decision, but he worked with him again in On The Waterfront. "
Triumph's importers were ambivalent at the exposure, as the subject matter was rowdy motorcycle gangs taking over a small town.
When initially offered the role, Brando—still stung by Kazan's testimony to HUAC—demurred and the part of Terry Malloy nearly went to Frank Sinatra.
Brando won the Oscar for his role as Irish-American stevedore Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront.
In his July 29, 1954, review, The New York Times critic A. H. Weiler praised the film, calling it "an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals."
He portrayed Napoleon in the 1954 film Désirée.
Brando was especially contemptuous of director Henry Koster.
Relations between Brando and costar Frank Sinatra were also frosty, with Stefan Kanfer observing: "The two men were diametrical opposites: Marlon required multiple takes; Frank detested repeating himself."
Frank Sinatra called Brando "the world's most overrated actor", and referred to him as "mumbles".
Pauline Kael was not particularly impressed by the movie, but noted "Marlon Brando starved himself to play the pixie interpreter Sakini, and he looks as if he's enjoying the stunt—talking with a mad accent, grinning boyishly, bending forward, and doing tricky movements with his legs.
Newsweek found the film a "dull tale of the meeting of the twain", but it was nevertheless a box-office success.
The film went on to win four Academy Awards.
By all accounts, Brando was devastated by her death, with biographer Peter Manso telling A&E's Biography, "She was the one who could give him approval like no one else could and, after his mother died, it seems that Marlon stops caring."
The Young Lions also features Brando's only appearance in a film with friend and rival Montgomery Clift (although they shared no scenes together).
Brando portrays the lead character Rio, and Karl Malden plays his partner "Dad" Longworth.
Brando's inexperience as an editor also delayed postproduction and Paramount eventually took control of the film.
By then, I was bored with the whole project and walked away from it."
Brando's revulsion with the film industry reportedly boiled over on the set of his next film, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's remake of Mutiny on the Bounty, which was filmed in Tahiti.
Mutiny director Lewis Milestone claimed that the executives "deserve what they get when they give a ham actor, a petulant child, complete control over an expensive picture."
The Ugly American (1963) was the first of these films.
All of Brando's other Universal films during this period, including Bedtime Story (1964), The Appaloosa (1966), A Countess from Hong Kong (1967) and The Night of the Following Day (1969), were also critical and commercial flops.
Brando had also appeared in the spy thriller Morituri in 1965; that, too, failed to attract an audience.
Candy was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand and based on the 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the film satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin.
In the March 1966 issue of The Atlantic, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando "was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap", but now Brando and others like him had become "buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations."
I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot."
The film overall received mixed reviews.
Brando dedicated a full chapter to the film in his memoir, stating that the director, Gillo Pontecorvo, was the best director he had ever worked with next to Kazan and Bernardo Bertolucci.
In 1971, Michael Winner directed him in the British horror film The Nightcomers with Stephanie Beacham, Thora Hird, Harry Andrews and Anna Palk.
He bested Brando at the 1972 New York Film Critics Circle Awards.)
Brando also had One-Eyed Jacks working against him, a troubled production that lost money for Paramount when it was released in 1961.
Coppola convinced Brando to a videotaped "make-up" test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the character's puffed cheeks).
Brando had doubts himself, stating in his autobiography, "I had never played an Italian before, and I didn't think I could do it successfully."
Brando was signed for a low fee of $50,000, but in his contract, he was given a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale: 1% of the gross for each $10 million over a $10 million threshold, up to 5% if the picture exceeded $60 million.
In a 1994 interview that can be found on the Academy of Achievement website, Coppola insisted, "The Godfather was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it.
They didn't like the way I was shooting it.
In a 2010 television interview with Larry King, Al Pacino also talked about how Brando's support helped him keep the role of Michael Corleone in the movie—despite the fact Coppola wanted to fire him.
He broke the ice by toasting the group with a glass of wine.
Caan adds, 'The first day we met Brando everybody was in awe.'"
Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I thought it would be an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike Al Capone, who beat up people with baseball bats."
There was really no beginning.
He boycotted the award ceremony, instead sending indigenous American rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who appeared in full Apache attire, to state Brando's reasons, which were based on his objection to the depiction of indigenous Americans by Hollywood and television.
As with previous films, Brando refused to memorize his lines for many scenes; instead, he wrote his lines on cue cards and posted them around the set for easy reference, leaving Bertolucci with the problem of keeping them out of the picture frame.
His gross participation deal earned him $3 million.
Pauline Kael, in The New Yorker review, wrote "The movie breakthrough has finally come.
In 1973, Brando was devastated by the death of his childhood best friend Wally Cox.
Absent for the first hour of the movie, Clayton enters on horseback, dangling upside down, caparisoned in white buckskin, Littlefeather-style.
Penn, who believed in letting actors do their thing, indulged Marlon all the way."
In 1978, Brando narrated the English version of Raoni, a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil.
In 1979, he made a rare television appearance in the miniseries Roots: The Next Generations, portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance.
Brando was paid $1 million a week for 3 weeks work.
In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself.
However, he returned in 1989 in A Dry White Season, based on André Brink's 1979 anti-apartheid novel.
Brando received praise for his performance, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and winning the Best Actor Award at the Tokyo Film Festival.
Variety also praised Brando's performance as Sabatini and noted, "Marlon Brando's sublime comedy performance elevates The Freshman from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history."
The Island of Dr. Moreau screenwriter Ron Hutchinson would later say in his memoir, Clinging to the Iceberg: Writing for a Living on the Stage and in Hollywood (2017), that Brando sabotaged the film's production by feuding and refusing to cooperate with his colleagues and the film crew.
This was his last role and his only role as a female character.
The actor's son, Miko, was Jackson's bodyguard and assistant for several years, and was a friend of the singer.
Dad had a hard time breathing in his final days, and he was on oxygen much of the time.
So Michael got Dad a golf cart with a portable oxygen tank so he could go around and enjoy Neverland.
He also suffered from diabetes and liver cancer.
His single recorded line was included within the final game as a tribute to the actor.
A distressed Brando told Malden he kept falling over.
Shortly before his death, he had apparently refused permission for tubes carrying oxygen to be inserted into his lungs, which, he was told, was the only way to prolong his life.
In 1976, he told a French journalist, "Homosexuality is so much in fashion, it no longer makes news.
He also claimed numerous other romances, although he did not discuss his marriages, his wives, or his children in his autobiography.
Brando met actress Rita Moreno in 1954, and they began a love affair.
Years after they broke up, Moreno played his love interest in the film The Night of the Following Day.
She is said to have been the daughter of a Welsh steel worker of Irish descent, William O'Callaghan, who had been superintendent on the Indian State railways.
Brando and Kashfi had a son, Christian Brando, on May 11, 1958; they divorced in 1959.
They had two children together: Miko Castaneda Brando (born 1961) and Rebecca Brando (born 1966).
Because Teriipaia was a native French speaker, Brando became fluent in the language and gave numerous interviews in French.
Brando and Teriipaia divorced in July 1972.
Brando had a long-term relationship with his housekeeper Maria Cristina Ruiz, with whom he had three children: Ninna Priscilla Brando (born May 13, 1989), Myles Jonathan Brando (born January 16, 1992), and Timothy Gahan Brando (born January 6, 1994).
His numerous grandchildren also include Prudence Brando and Shane Brando, children of Miko C. Brando; the children of Rebecca Brando; and the three children of Teihotu Brando among others.
His behavior during the filming of Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) seemed to bolster his reputation as a difficult star.
Galella had followed Brando, who was accompanied by talk show host Dick Cavett, after a taping of The Dick Cavett Show in New York City.
The filming of Mutiny on the Bounty affected Brando's life in a profound way, as he fell in love with Tahiti and its people.
The 1983 hurricane destroyed many of the structures including his resort.
He was listed in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) records as Martin Brandeaux to preserve his privacy.
He attended some fundraisers for John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.
In autumn of 1967, Brando visited Helsinki, Finland at a charity party organized by UNICEF at the Helsinki City Theatre.
He spoke in favor of children’s rights and development aid in developing countries.
I felt I'd better go find out where it is; what it is to be black in this country; what this rage is all about," Brando said on the late-night ABC-TV talk show Joey Bishop Show.
It was one of the most incredible acts of courage I ever saw, and it meant a lot and did a lot."
In 1964 Brando was arrested at a "fish-in" held to protest a broken treaty that had promised Native Americans fishing rights in Puget Sound.
Brando ended his financial support for the group over his perception of its increasing radicalization, specifically a passage in a Panther pamphlet put out by Eldridge Cleaver advocating indiscriminate violence, "for the Revolution."
Sacheen Littlefeather represented him at the ceremony.
The event grabbed the attention of the US and the world media.
He was also an activist against apartheid.
He is listed by the American Film Institute as the fourth greatest male star whose screen debut occurred before or during 1950 (it occurred in 1950).
Retrieved August 19, 2009.Encyclopedia Britannica describes him as "the most celebrated of the method actors, and his slurred, mumbling delivery marked his rejection of classical dramatic training.
He was a development from the gangster leader and the outlaw.
His portrayal of the gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One has become an iconic image, used both as a symbol of rebelliousness and a fashion accessory that includes a Perfecto style motorcycle jacket, a tilted cap, jeans and sunglasses.
The "I coulda been a contender" scene from On the Waterfront, according to the author of Brooklyn Boomer, Martin H. Levinson, is "one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history, and the line itself has become part of America's cultural lexicon."
You have to make 'em believe that you are dying ... Try to think of the most intimate moment you've ever had in your life."
In 1999 the American Film Institute ranked him eighth among its list of greatest male stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.
He spent several years in vaudeville as a dancer and comedian, until he got his first major acting part in 1925.
After rave reviews, Warner Bros. signed him for an initial $400-a-week, three-week contract; when the executives at the studio saw the first dailies for the film, Cagney's contract was immediately extended.
He was nominated a third time in 1955 for Love Me or Leave Me with Doris Day.
Cagney walked out on Warner Bros. several times over the course of his career, each time returning on much improved personal and artistic terms.
He worked for an independent film company for a year while the suit was being settled, establishing his own production company, Cagney Productions, in 1942 before returning to Warner seven years later.
Cagney was the second of seven children, two of whom died within months of their births.
The family moved twice while he was still young, first to East 79th Street, and then to East 96th Street.
I feel sorry for the kid who has too cushy a time of it.
He was a good street fighter, defending his older brother Harry, a medical student, when necessary.
He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House (one of the first settlement houses in the nation) where his brother Harry performed and Florence James directed.
The show began Cagney's 10-year association with vaudeville and Broadway.
Eventually, they borrowed some money and headed back to New York via Chicago and Milwaukee, enduring failure along the way when they attempted to make money on the stage.
As with Pitter Patter, Cagney went to the audition with little confidence he would get the part.
This was a devastating turn of events for Cagney; apart from the logistical difficulties this presented—the couple's luggage was in the hold of the ship and they had given up their apartment.
He made up his mind that he would get a job doing something else."
Cagney also established a dance school for professionals, and then landed a part in the play Women Go On Forever, directed by John Cromwell, which ran for four months.
The show received rave reviews and was followed by Grand Street Follies of 1929.
Retitled Sinners' Holiday, the film was released in 1930.
However, the contract allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively guaranteeing him only 40 weeks’ income at a time.
Due to the strong reviews he had received in his short film career, Cagney was cast as nice-guy Matt Doyle, opposite Edward Woods as Tom Powers.
Producer Darryl Zanuck claimed he thought of it in a script conference; Wellman said the idea came to him when he saw the grapefruit on the table during the shoot; and writers Glasmon and Bright claimed it was based on the real life of gangster Hymie Weiss, who threw an omelette into his girlfriend's face.
I never dreamed it would be shown in the movie.
He saw the film repeatedly just to see that scene, and was often shushed by angry patrons when his delighted laughter got too loud."
Warner Bros. was quick to team its two rising gangster stars—Edward G. Robinson and Cagney—for the 1931 film Smart Money.
As he completed filming, The Public Enemy was filling cinemas with all-night showings.
The studio heads also insisted that Cagney continue promoting their films, even ones he was not in, which he opposed.
The success of The Public Enemy and Blonde Crazy forced Warner Bros.' hand.
The film was swiftly followed by The Crowd Roars and Winner Take All.
Historians also debate the nature of history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give perspective on the problems of the present.
However, ancient cultural influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today.
Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian, is often considered the "father of history" in the Western tradition, although he has also been criticized as the "father of lies".
In Middle English, the meaning of history was "story" in general.
In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".
In the words of Benedetto Croce, "All history is contemporary history".
Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the "true past").
The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the humanities and at other times as part of the social sciences.
In the 20th century, French historian Fernand Braudel revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography in the study of global history.
In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.
Archaeological finds rarely stand alone, with narrative sources complementing its discoveries.
For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA, has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents idealizing "liberty" and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth made apparent by the study of the total historical environment.
It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization.
Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the philosophy of history.
By whom was it produced (authorship)?
What is the evidential value of its contents (credibility)?
The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history.
Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention (though Herodotus was not wholly committed to this idea himself).
There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval China.
Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his Shiji as the official format for historical texts, as well as for biographical literature.
Around 1800, German philosopher and historian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach in historical study.
The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past.
His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history,H. Mowlana (2001). "
Dr. S.W. Akhtar (1997). "
For Ranke, historical data should be collected carefully, examined objectively and put together with critical rigor.
In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces.
Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach.
So far only one theory of history came from the pen of a professional Historian.
Intellectual historians such as Herbert Butterfield, Ernst Nolte and George Mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history.
Scholars such as Martin Broszat, Ian Kershaw and Detlev Peukert sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the Nazi period.
Feminist historians such as Joan Wallach Scott, Claudia Koonz, Natalie Zemon Davis, Sheila Rowbotham, Gisela Bock, Gerda Lerner, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Lynn Hunt have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past.
Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian Keith Windschuttle's 1994 book, The Killing of History.
Historical omissions can occur in many ways and can have a profound effect on historical records.
Ancient history: the study from the beginning of human history until the Early Middle Ages.
Comparative history: historical analysis of social and cultural entities not confined to national boundaries.
Cultural history: the study of culture in the past.
Intellectual history: the study of ideas in the context of the cultures that produced them and their development over time.
Modern history: the study of the Modern Times, the era after the Middle Ages.
Palaeography: study of ancient texts.
Psychohistory: study of the psychological motivations of historical events.
Women's history: the history of female human beings.
Centuries and decades are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the dating system used.
To do this, historians often turn to geography.
For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the geography of Egypt is essential.
History of the Americas is the collective history of North and South America, including Central America and the Caribbean.
History of the Caribbean begins with the oldest evidence where 7,000-year-old remains have been found.
History of Eurasia is the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions: the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe, linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.
History of East Asia is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in East Asia.
History of Southeast Asia has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers.
The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system.
It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people.
This type of political history is the study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries over time.
It gained popularity in the United States, Japan and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.
Despite being a relatively new field, gender history has had a significant effect on the general study of history.
At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed.
The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War.
In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe.
Many view the field from both perspectives.
In the United States, textbooks published by the same company often differ in content from state to state.
Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.
A civilization (or civilisation) is a complex society that is characterized by urban development, social stratification, a form of government, and symbolic systems of communication (such as writing).
In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies or hunter-gatherers; however, sometimes it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves.
The fundamental treatise is Norbert Elias's The Civilizing Process (1939), which traces social mores from medieval courtly society to the Early Modern period.
Related words like "civility" developed in the mid-16th century.
In the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the French Revolution, "civilization" was used in the singular, never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole.
Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a "medieval civilization", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron.
Here, civilization, being more rational and socially driven, is not fully in accord with human nature, and "human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original discursive or prerational natural unity" (see noble savage).
Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of livelihood, settlement patterns, forms of government, social stratification, economic systems, literacy and other cultural traits.
All civilizations have depended on agriculture for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru which may have depended upon maritime resources.
Grain surpluses have been especially important because grain can be stored for a long time.
However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and perhaps during the Mesolithic Natufian culture.
The word "civilization" is sometimes simply defined as "'living in cities'".
State societies are more stratified than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes.
Civilizations, with complex social hierarchies and organized, institutional governments.
Some people also acquire landed property, or private ownership of the land.
By the early Iron Age, contemporary civilizations developed money as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions.
These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time.
The transition from simpler to more complex economies does not necessarily mean an improvement in the living standards of the populace.
The average stature of a population is a good measurement of the adequacy of its access to necessities, especially food.
Like money, the writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other.
These include organized religion, development in the arts, and countless new advances in science and technology.
These cultures are called by some "primitive", a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. "
Anthropologists today use the term "non-literate" to describe these peoples.
But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.
Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a state-based decision making apparatus, a literature, professional art, architecture, organized religion and complex customs of education, coercion and control associated with maintaining the elite.
The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.
The aim is to preserve the cultural heritage of humanity and also the cultural identity, especially in the case of war and armed conflict.
Early twentieth-century philosopher Oswald Spengler,Spengler, Oswald, Decline of the West: Perspectives of World History (1919) uses the German word Kultur, "culture", for what many call a "civilization".
Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as "the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable".
Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a "creative minority", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.
For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres.
During the Uruk period, Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan.
Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways.
Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century.
This encouraged a secondary products revolution in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, wool, manure and pulling ploughs and carts – a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene.
This area has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of the cursive script".
This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of endemic violence between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, associated with the first civilizations.
The civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of sedentism, the domestication of grains and animals, the permanence of settlements and development of lifestyles that facilitated economies of scale and accumulation of surplus production by certain social sectors.
Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory.
For Gibbon, "The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.
Theodor Mommsen in his History of Rome suggested Rome collapsed with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE and he also tended towards a biological analogy of "genesis", "growth", "senescence", "collapse" and "decay".
Arnold J. Toynbee in his A Study of History suggested that there had been a much larger number of civilizations, including a small number of arrested civilizations, and that all civilizations tended to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen.
During the intermediate phase, the increasing population growth leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing, whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state.
Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.
The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the Empire.
He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today.
The energy expended to energy yield ratio is central to limiting the survival of civilizations.
Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot be mixed into hybrids, an inferior civilization when given equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome it.
Cultural Historian Morris Berman suggests in Dark Ages America: the End of Empire that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness―extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth―have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable.
The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.
This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources.
In the graphic, Ma means "million years ago".)
Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism.
Recognizable humans emerged at most 2 million years ago, a vanishingly small period on the geological scale.
It is estimated that 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth, over five billion, have gone extinct.
The Earth's crust has constantly changed since its formation, as has life since its first appearance.
The Moon is formed around this time probably due to a protoplanet's collision into Earth.
The atmosphere is composed of volcanic and greenhouse gases.
Bacteria begin producing oxygen, shaping the third and current of Earth's atmospheres.
The early continents of Columbia, Rodinia and Pannotia, in that order, may have existed in this eon.
Gradually, life expands to land and familiar forms of plants, animals and fungi begin appearing, including annelids, insects and reptiles, hence the eon's name, which means "visible life".
It was composed of hydrogen and helium created shortly after the Big Bang 13.8 Ga (billion years ago) and heavier elements ejected by supernovae.
As the cloud began to accelerate, its angular momentum, gravity, and inertia flattened it into a protoplanetary disk perpendicular to its axis of rotation.
After more contraction, a T Tauri star ignited and evolved into the Sun.
Earth formed in this manner about 4.54 billion years ago (with an uncertainty of 1%) and was largely completed within 10–20 million years.
The proto-Earth grew by accretion until its interior was hot enough to melt the heavy, siderophile metals.
From crater counts on other celestial bodies, it is inferred that a period of intense meteorite impacts, called the Late Heavy Bombardment, began about 4.1 Ga, and concluded around 3.8 Ga, at the end of the Hadean.
By the beginning of the Archean, the Earth had cooled significantly.
New evidence suggests the Moon formed even later, 4.48 ± 0.02 Ga, or 70–110 million years after the start of the Solar System.
The collision released about 100 million times more energy than the more recent Chicxulub impact that is believed to have caused the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.
The giant impact hypothesis predicts that the Moon was depleted of metallic material, explaining its abnormal composition.
The initial crust, formed when the Earth's surface first solidified, totally disappeared from a combination of this fast Hadean plate tectonics and the intense impacts of the Late Heavy Bombardment.
These pieces of late Hadean and early Archean crust form the cores around which today's continents grew.
Cratons consist primarily of two alternating types of terranes.
For this reason, greenstones are sometimes seen as evidence for subduction during the Archean.
Now it is considered likely that many of the volatiles were delivered during accretion by a process known as impact degassing in which incoming bodies vaporize on impact.
Planetesimals at a distance of 1 astronomical unit (AU), the distance of the Earth from the Sun, probably did not contribute any water to the Earth because the solar nebula was too hot for ice to form and the hydration of rocks by water vapor would have taken too long.
Recent evidence suggests the oceans may have begun forming as early as 4.4 Ga. By the start of the Archean eon, they already covered much of the Earth.
Thus, the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years.
There are many models, but little consensus, on how life emerged from non-living chemicals; chemical systems created in the laboratory fall well short of the minimum complexity for a living organism.
Although atmospheric composition was probably different from that used by Miller and Urey, later experiments with more realistic compositions also managed to synthesize organic molecules.
RNA would later have been replaced by DNA, which is more stable and therefore can build longer genomes, expanding the range of capabilities a single organism can have.
A difficulty with the metabolism-first scenario is finding a way for organisms to evolve.
Research in 2003 reported that montmorillonite could also accelerate the conversion of fatty acids into "bubbles", and that the bubbles could encapsulate RNA attached to the clay.
This LUA cell is the ancestor of all life on Earth today.
The change to an oxygen-rich atmosphere was a crucial development.
They used fermentation, the breakdown of more complex compounds into less complex compounds with less energy, and used the energy so liberated to grow and reproduce.
Most of the life that covers the surface of the Earth depends directly or indirectly on photosynthesis.
To supply the electrons in the circuit, hydrogen is stripped from water, leaving oxygen as a waste product.
The simpler anoxygenic form arose about 3.8 Ga, not long after the appearance of life.
At first, the released oxygen was bound up with limestone, iron, and other minerals.
Though each cell only produced a minute amount of oxygen, the combined metabolism of many cells over a vast time transformed Earth's atmosphere to its current state.
The ozone layer absorbed, and still absorbs, a significant amount of the ultraviolet radiation that once had passed through the atmosphere.
As a result, the Earth began to receive more heat from the Sun in the Proterozoic eon.
Glacial deposits found in South Africa date back to 2.2 Ga, at which time, based on paleomagnetic evidence, they must have been located near the equator.
The Huronian ice age might have been caused by the increased oxygen concentration in the atmosphere, which caused the decrease of methane (CH4) in the atmosphere.
However, the term Snowball Earth is more commonly used to describe later extreme ice ages during the Cryogenian period.
Carbon dioxide combines with rain to weather rocks to form carbonic acid, which is then washed out to sea, thus extracting the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.
The Bacteria domain probably first split off from the other forms of life (sometimes called Neomura), but this supposition is controversial.
The earliest fossils possessing features typical of fungi date to the Paleoproterozoic era, some 2.4 ago; these multicellular benthic organisms had filamentous structures capable of anastomosis.
Perhaps the large cell attempted to digest the smaller one but failed (possibly due to the evolution of prey defenses).
Using oxygen, it metabolized the larger cell's waste products and derived more energy.
Soon, a stable symbiosis developed between the large cell and the smaller cells inside it.
A similar event occurred with photosynthetic cyanobacteria entering large heterotrophic cells and becoming chloroplasts.
Besides the well-established endosymbiotic theory of the cellular origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts, there are theories that cells led to peroxisomes, spirochetes led to cilia and flagella, and that perhaps a DNA virus led to the cell nucleus, though none of them are widely accepted.
Around 1.1 Ga, the supercontinent Rodinia was assembling.
Although the division between a colony with specialized cells and a multicellular organism is not always clear, around 1 billion years ago, the first multicellular plants emerged, probably green algae.
Paleomagnetic poles are supplemented by geologic evidence such as orogenic belts, which mark the edges of ancient plates, and past distributions of flora and fauna.
About 1000 to 830 Ma, most continental mass was united in the supercontinent Rodinia.
The hypothetical supercontinent is sometimes referred to as Pannotia or Vendia.
The intensity and mechanism of both glaciations are still under investigation and harder to explain than the early Proterozoic Snowball Earth.
Because CO2 is an important greenhouse gas, climates cooled globally.
Increased volcanic activity resulted from the break-up of Rodinia at about the same time.
The new forms of life, called Ediacara biota, were larger and more diverse than ever.
It consists of three eras: The Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, and is the time when multi-cellular life greatly diversified into almost all the organisms known today.
This causes the sea level to rise.
Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana.
The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica).
The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America.
Whereas the Ediacaran life forms appear yet primitive and not easy to put in any modern group, at the end of the Cambrian most modern phyla were already present.
Some of these Cambrian groups appear complex but are seemingly quite different from modern life; examples are Anomalocaris and Haikouichthys.
A creature that could have been the ancestor of the fishes, or was probably closely related to it, was Pikaia.
Fish, the earliest vertebrates, evolved in the oceans around 530 Ma.
The oldest fossils of land fungi and plants date to 480–460 Ma, though molecular evidence suggests the fungi may have colonized the land as early as 1000 Ma and the plants 700 Ma.
Fins evolved to become limbs that the first tetrapods used to lift their heads out of the water to breathe air.
Eventually, some of them became so well adapted to terrestrial life that they spent their adult lives on land, although they hatched in the water and returned to lay their eggs.
Plants evolved seeds, which dramatically accelerated their spread on land, around this time (by approximately 360 Ma).
Another 30 million years (310 Ma) saw the divergence of the synapsids (including mammals) from the sauropsids (including birds and reptiles).
The Triassic–Jurassic extinction event at 200 Ma spared many of the dinosaurs, and they soon became dominant among the vertebrates.
60% of marine invertebrates became extinct and 25% of all families.
The third mass extinction was the Permian-Triassic, or the Great Dying, event was possibly caused by some combination of the Siberian Traps volcanic event, an asteroid impact, methane hydrate gasification, sea level fluctuations, and a major anoxic event.
This was by far the deadliest extinction ever, with about 57% of all families and 83% of all genera killed.
By the early Paleocene the earth recovered from the extinction, and mammalian diversity increased.
Grassless savanna began to predominate much of the landscape, and mammals such as Andrewsarchus rose up to become the largest known terrestrial predatory mammal ever, and early whales like Basilosaurus took control of the seas.
Giant ungulates like Paraceratherium and Deinotherium evolved to rule the grasslands.
The Tethys Sea was closed off by the collision of Africa and Europe.
The land bridge allowed the isolated creatures of South America to migrate over to North America, and vice versa.
The ice ages led to the evolution of modern man in Saharan Africa and expansion.
It is believed by many that a huge migration took place along Beringia which is why, today, there are camels (which evolved and became extinct in North America), horses (which evolved and became extinct in North America), and Native Americans.
Brain size increased rapidly, and by 2 Ma, the first animals classified in the genus Homo had appeared.
The ability to control fire probably began in Homo erectus (or Homo ergaster), probably at least 790,000 years ago but perhaps as early as 1.5 Ma.
It is more difficult to establish the origin of language; it is unclear whether Homo erectus could speak or if that capability had not begun until Homo sapiens.
Social skills became more complex, language became more sophisticated, and tools became more elaborate.
The first humans to show signs of spirituality are the Neanderthals (usually classified as a separate species with no surviving descendants); they buried their dead, often with no sign of food or tools.
As language became more complex, the ability to remember and communicate information resulted, according to a theory proposed by Richard Dawkins, in a new replicator: the meme.
Between 8500 and 7000 BC, humans in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals: agriculture.
However, among those civilizations that did adopt agriculture, the relative stability and increased productivity provided by farming allowed the population to expand.
This led to Earth's first civilization at Sumer in the Middle East, between 4000 and 3000 BC.
Humans no longer had to spend all their time working for survival, enabling the first specialized occupations (e.g. craftsmen, merchants, priests, etc.).
By around 500 BC, there were advanced civilizations in the Middle East, Iran, India, China, and Greece, at times expanding, at times entering into decline.
This civilization developed in warfare, arts, science, mathematics and in architect.
The Roman Empire was Christianized by Emperor Constantine in the early 4th century and declined by the end of the 5th.
The House of Wisdom was established in Abbasid-era Baghdad, Iraq.
In the 14th century, the Renaissance began in Italy with advances in religion, art, and science.
European civilization began to change beginning in 1500, leading to the scientific and industrial revolutions.
From 1914 to 1918 and 1939 to 1945, nations around the world were embroiled in world wars.
After the war, many new states were formed, declaring or being granted independence in a period of decolonization.
Technological developments include nuclear weapons, computers, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology.
Major concerns and problems such as disease, war, poverty, violent radicalism, and recently, human-caused climate change have risen as the world population increases.
Human history, or recorded history, is the narrative of humanity's past.
The Neolithic saw the Agricultural Revolution begin, between 10,000 and 5000 BCE, in the Near East's Fertile Crescent.
As farming developed, grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons.
Hinduism developed in the late Bronze Age on the Indian subcontinent.
Post-classical history (the "Middle Ages," c. 500–1500 CE,) witnessed the rise of Christianity, the Islamic Golden Age (c. 750 CE – c. 1258 CE), and the Timurid and Italian Renaissances (from around 1300 CE).
By the 18th century, the accumulation of knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that brought about the Industrial Revolution and began the late modern period, which started around 1800 and has continued through the present.
Anatomically modern humans arose in Africa about 300,000 years ago, and achieved behavioral modernity about 50,000 years ago.
Perhaps as early as 1.8 million years ago, but certainly by 500,000 years ago, humans began to use fire for heat and cooking.
Paleolithic humans lived as hunter-gatherers, and were generally nomadic.
The rapid expansion of humankind to North America and Oceania took place at the climax of the most recent ice age.
The Yellow River valley in China cultivated millet and other cereal crops by about 7000 BCE; the Yangtze valley domesticated rice earlier, by at least 8000 BCE.
Metalworking, was first used in the creation of copper tools and ornaments around 6000 BCE.
Cities were centres of trade, manufacturing and political power.
The development of cities was synonymous with the rise of civilization.
These cultures variously invented the wheel, mathematics, bronze-working, sailing boats, the potter's wheel, woven cloth, construction of monumental buildings, and writing.
Typical of the Neolithic was a tendency to worship anthropomorphic deities.
These settlements were concentrated in fertile river valleys: the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia, the Nile in Egypt, the Indus in the Indian subcontinent, and the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers in China.
Cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs, whose pictorial representations eventually became simplified and more abstract.
Transport was facilitated by waterways—by rivers and seas.
These developments led to the rise of territorial states and empires.
In Crete the Minoan civilization had entered the Bronze Age by 2700 BCE and is regarded as the first civilization in Europe.
Over the following millennia, civilizations developed across the world.
In India, this era was the Vedic period (1750-600 BCE), which laid the foundations of Hinduism and other cultural aspects of early Indian society, and ended in the 6th century BCE.
During the formative stage in Mesoamerica (about 1500 BCE to 500 CE), more complex and centralized civilizations began to develop, mostly in what is now Mexico, Central America, and Peru.
Karl Jaspers' Axial-Age theory also includes Persian Zoroastrianism, but other scholars dispute his timeline for Zoroastrianism.)
These were Taoism, Legalism, and Confucianism.
The great empires depended on military annexation of territory and on the formation of defended settlements to become agricultural centres.
There were a number of regional empires during this period.
The Median Empire gave way to successive Iranian empires, including the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE), the Parthian Empire (247 BCE–224 CE), and the Sasanian Empire (224–651 CE).
Later, Alexander the Great (356–323 BCE), of Macedon, founded an empire of conquest, extending from present-day Greece to present-day India.
From the 3rd century CE, the Gupta dynasty oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's Golden Age.
The ensuing stability contributed to heralding in the golden age of Hindu culture in the 4th and 5th centuries.
By the time of Augustus (63 BCE – 14 CE), the first Roman Emperor, Rome had already established dominion over most of the Mediterranean.
The Western empire would fall, in 476 CE, to German influence under Odoacer.
The Han dynasty was comparable in power and influence to the Roman Empire that lay at the other end of the Silk Road.
As with other empires during the Classical Period, Han China advanced significantly in the areas of government, education, mathematics, astronomy, technology, and many others.
Successful regional empires were also established in the Americas, arising from cultures established as early as 2500 BCE.
The great Mayan city-states slowly rose in number and prominence, and Maya culture spread throughout the Yucatán and surrounding areas.
There were, however, in some regions, periods of rapid technological progress.
China's Han dynasty fell into civil war in 220 CE, beginning the Three Kingdoms period, while its Roman counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the same time in what is known as the Crisis of the Third Century.
The development of the stirrup and the breeding of horses strong enough to carry a fully armed archer made the nomads a constant threat to the more settled civilizations.
The remaining part of the Roman Empire, in the eastern Mediterranean, continued as what came to be called the Byzantine Empire.
The era is commonly dated from the 5th-century fall of the Western Roman Empire, which fragmented into many separate kingdoms, some of which would later be confederated under the Holy Roman Empire.
South Asia saw a series of middle kingdoms of India, followed by the establishment of Islamic empires in India.
This allowed Africa to join the Southeast Asia trading system, bringing it contact with Asia; this, along with Muslim culture, resulted in the Swahili culture.
This was also a cultural battle, with the Byzantine Hellenistic and Christian culture competing against the Persian Iranian traditions and Zoroastrian religion.
From their centre on the Arabian Peninsula, Muslims began their expansion during the early Postclassical Era.
Much of this learning and development can be linked to geography.
The influence held by Muslim merchants over African-Arabian and Arabian-Asian trade routes was tremendous.
Motivated by religion and dreams of conquest, European leaders launched a number of Crusades to try to roll back Muslim power and retake the Holy Land.
Arab domination of the region ended in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the Seljuq Turks, migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia.
The region will later be called the Barbary Coast and will host pirates and privateers who will use several North African ports for their raids against the coastal towns of several European countries in search of slaves to be sold in North African markets as part of the Barbary slave trade.
In the 8th century, Islam began to penetrate the region and soon became the sole faith of most of the population, though Buddhism remained strong in the east.
After Genghis Khan died in 1227, most of Central Asia continued to be dominated by a successor state, Chagatai Khanate.
The region then became divided into a series of smaller khanates that were created by the Uzbeks.
The barbarian invaders formed their own new kingdoms in the remains of the Western Roman Empire.
Christianity expanded in western Europe, and monasteries were founded.
Manorialism, the organization of peasants into villages that owed rents and labour service to nobles, and feudalism, a political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rents from lands and manors, were two of the ways of organizing medieval society that developed during the High Middle Ages.
Italian merchants imported slaves to work in households or in sugar processing.
Famine, plague, and war devastated the population of western Europe.
They eventually gave way to the Zagwe dynasty who are famed for their rock cut architecture at Lalibela.
They controlled the trans-Saharan trade in gold, ivory, salt and slaves.
Central Africa saw the birth of several states, including the Kingdom of Kongo.
They built large defensive stone structures without mortar such as Great Zimbabwe, capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe, Khami, capital of Kingdom of Butua, and Danangombe (Dhlo-Dhlo), capital of the Rozvi Empire.
The ninth century saw a Tripartite Struggle for control of northern India, among the Pratihara Empire, the Pala Empire, and the Rashtrakuta Empire.
The Tang dynasty eventually splintered, however, and after half a century of turmoil the Song dynasty reunified China, when it was, according to William McNeill, the "richest, most skilled, and most populous country on earth".
After about a century of Mongol Yuan dynasty rule, the ethnic Chinese reasserted control with the founding of the Ming dynasty (1368).
The Nara period of the 8th century marked the emergence of a strong Japanese state and is often portrayed as a golden age.
The feudal period of Japanese history, dominated by powerful regional lords (daimyos) and the military rule of warlords (shoguns) such as the Ashikaga shogunate and Tokugawa shogunate, stretched from 1185 to 1868.
Silla conquered Baekje in 660, and Goguryeo in 668, marking the beginning of the Northern and Southern States period (남북국시대), with Unified Silla in the south and Balhae, a successor state to Goguryeo, in the north.
Starting in the 9th century, the Bagan Kingdom rose to prominence in modern Myanmar.
The Ancestral Puebloans and their predecessors (9th – 13th centuries) built extensive permanent settlements, including stone structures that would remain the largest buildings in North America until the 19th century.
In South America, the 14th and 15th centuries saw the rise of the Inca.
The Scientific Revolution received impetus from Johannes Gutenberg's introduction to Europe of printing, using movable type, and from the invention of the telescope and microscope.
The late modern period continues either to the end of World War II, in 1945, or to the present.
The early Modern period was characterized by the rise of science, and by increasingly rapid technological progress, secularized civic politics, and the nation state.
During the early modern period, Europe was able to regain its dominance; historians still debate the causes.
It had developed an advanced monetary economy by 1000 CE.
It enjoyed a technological advantage and had a monopoly in cast iron production, piston bellows, suspension bridge construction, printing, and the compass.
One theory of Europe's rise holds that Europe's geography played an important role in its success.
This gave Europe some degree of protection from the peril of Central Asian invaders.
The Golden Age of Islam was ended by the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258.
Geography contributed to important geopolitical differences.
By contrast, Europe was almost always divided into a number of warring states.
Nearly all the agricultural civilizations have been heavily constrained by their environments.
Technological advance and the wealth generated by trade gradually brought about a widening of possibilities.
Europe's maritime expansion unsurprisingly—given the continent's geography—was largely the work of its Atlantic states: Portugal, Spain, England, France, and the Netherlands.
In North Africa, the Saadi Sultanate remained as an independent Berber state until 1659.
The Swahili coast declined after coming under the Portuguese Empire and later the Omani Empire.
The South African Kingdom of Zimbabwe gave way to smaller kingdoms such as Mutapa, Butua, and Rozvi.
Other civilizations in Africa advanced during this period.
Japan experienced its Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1603), followed by the Edo period (1603–1868).
The Johor Sultanate, centred on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, became the dominant trading power in the region.
Russia made incursions onto the northwest coast of North America, with a first colony in present-day Alaska in 1784, and the outpost of Fort Ross in present-day California in 1812.
The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and used new modes of production—the factory, mass production, and mechanization—to manufacture a wide array of goods faster and using less labour than previously required.
After Europeans had achieved influence and control over the Americas, imperial activities turned to the lands of Asia and Oceania.
The British also colonized Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with large numbers of British colonists emigrating to these colonies.
Within Europe, economic and military challenges created a system of nation states, and ethno-linguistic groupings began to identify themselves as distinctive nations with aspirations for cultural and political autonomy.
Meanwhile, industrial pollution and environmental damage, present since the discovery of fire and the beginning of civilization, accelerated drastically.
Much of the rest of the world was influenced by heavily Europeanized nations: the United States and Japan.
World War I led to the collapse of four empires – Austria-Hungary, the German Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire – and weakened the United Kingdom and France.
Ongoing national rivalries, exacerbated by the economic turmoil of the Great Depression, helped precipitate World War II.
The Cold War ended peacefully in 1991 after the Pan-European Picnic, the subsequent fall of the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the Warsaw Pact.
In the early postwar decades, the colonies in Asia and Africa of the Belgian, British, Dutch, French, and other west European empires won their formal independence.
The European Union's effectiveness was handicapped by the immaturity of its common economic and political institutions, somewhat comparable to the inadequacy of United States institutions under the Articles of Confederation prior to the adoption of the Constitution of the United States that came into force in 1789.
In the decades after World War II, these advances led to jet travel, artificial satellites with innumerable applications including the Global Positioning System (GPS), and the Internet.
Worldwide competition for natural resources has risen due to growing populations and industrialization, especially in India, China, and Brazil.
An archive is an accumulation of historical records – in any media – or the physical facility in which they are located.
They have been metaphorically defined as "the secretions of an organism", and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity.
This means that archives are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings.
Archaeologists have discovered archives of hundreds (and sometime thousands) of clay tablets going back to the third and second millennia BC in sites like Ebla, Mari, Amarna, Hattusas, Ugarit, and Pylos.
However, they have been lost, since documents written on materials like papyrus and paper deteriorated at a faster pace, unlike their stone tablet counterparts.
England after 1066 developed archives and archival research methods.
While there are many kinds of archives, the most recent census of archivists in the United States identifies five major types: academic, business (for profit), government, non-profit, and other.
Access to the collections in these archives is usually by prior appointment only; some have posted hours for making inquiries.
Examples of prominent business archives in the United States include Coca-Cola (which also owns the separate museum World of Coca-Cola), Procter and Gamble, Motorola Heritage Services and Archives, and Levi Strauss & Co. These corporate archives maintain historic documents and items related to the history and administration of their companies.
Workers in these types of archives may have any combination of training and degrees, from either a history or library background.
In the United States, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) maintains central archival facilities in the District of Columbia and College Park, Maryland, with regional facilities distributed throughout the United States.
In the UK, the National Archives (formerly known as the Public Record Office) is the government archive for England and Wales.
Put together, the total volume of archives under the supervision of the French Archives Administration is the largest in the world.
Archdioceses, dioceses, and parishes also have archives in the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches.
Often these institutions rely on grant funding from the government as well as the private funds.
Many museums keep archives in order to prove the provenance of their pieces.
This was a separate figure from the 1.3% that identified themselves as self-employed.
The archive's mission is to gather stories from women who want to express themselves, and want their stories heard.
The archives of an organization (such as a corporation or government) tend to contain other types of records, such as administrative files, business records, memos, official correspondence, and meeting minutes.
Many of these donations have yet to be cataloged, but are currently in the process of being digitally preserved and made available to the public online.
International partners for archives are UNESCO and Blue Shield International in accordance with the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property from 1954 and its 2nd Protocol from 1999.
Page, Morgan M. "One from the Vaults: Gossip, Access, and Trans History-Telling."
An example of this is Morgan M. Page’s description of disseminating transgender history directly to trans people through various social media and networking platforms like tumblr, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as via podcast.
With the options available through counter-archiving, there is the potential to "challenge traditional conceptions of history" as they are perceived within contemporary archives, which creates space for narratives that are often not present in many archival materials.
A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life.
Biographical works are usually non-fiction, but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life.
Another well-known collection of ancient biographies is De vita Caesarum ("On the Lives of the Caesars") by Suetonius, written about AD 121 in the time of the emperor Hadrian.
Hermits, monks, and priests used this historic period to write biographies.
One significant secular example of a biography from this period is the life of Charlemagne by his courtier Einhard.
They contained more social data for a large segment of the population than other works of that period.
By the late Middle Ages, biographies became less church-oriented in Europe as biographies of kings, knights, and tyrants began to appear.
Following Malory, the new emphasis on humanism during the Renaissance promoted a focus on secular subjects, such as artists and poets, and encouraged writing in the vernacular.
Two other developments are noteworthy: the development of the printing press in the 15th century and the gradual increase in literacy.
Influential in shaping popular conceptions of pirates, A General History of the Pyrates (1724), by Charles Johnson, is the prime source for the biographies of many well-known pirates.
Carlyle asserted that the lives of great human beings were essential to understanding society and its institutions.
Boswell's work was unique in its level of research, which involved archival study, eye-witness accounts and interviews, its robust and attractive narrative, and its honest depiction of all aspects of Johnson's life and character – a formula which serves as the basis of biographical literature to this day.
However, the number of biographies in print experienced a rapid growth, thanks to an expanding reading public.
Periodicals began publishing a sequence of biographical sketches.
Sociological" biographies conceived of their subjects' actions as the result of the environment, and tended to downplay individuality.
The conventional concept of heroes and narratives of success disappeared in the obsession with psychological explorations of personality.
Up until this point, as Strachey remarked in the preface, Victorian biographies had been "as familiar as the cortège of the undertaker", and wore the same air of "slow, funereal barbarism."
The book achieved worldwide fame due to its irreverent and witty style, its concise and factually accurate nature, and its artistic prose.
Robert Graves (I, Claudius, 1934) stood out among those following Strachey's model of "debunking biographies."
By World War I, cheap hard-cover reprints had become popular.
Along with documentary biographical films, Hollywood produced numerous commercial films based on the lives of famous people.
Unlike books and films, they often do not tell a chronological narrative: instead they are archives of many discrete media elements related to an individual person, including video clips, photographs, and text articles.
General "life writing" techniques are a subject of scholarly study.

European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries, after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes.
Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source.
In the late 12th and early 13th centuries, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged.
These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts.
Although gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 14th century, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th century, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls.
Feudalism was the link between a lord and his vassal where, in return for military service and the expectation of loyalty, the lord would grant the vassal land.
Castles served a range of purposes, the most important of which were military, administrative, and domestic.
As William the Conqueror advanced through England, he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken.
A castle could act as a stronghold and prison but was also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers.
In different areas of the world, analogous structures shared features of fortification and other defining characteristics associated with the concept of a castle, though they originated in different periods and circumstances and experienced differing evolutions and influences.
By the 16th century, when Japanese and European cultures met, fortification in Europe had moved beyond castles and relied on innovations such as the Italian trace italienne and star forts.
The excavation of earth to make the mound left a ditch around the motte, called a moat (which could be either wet or dry).
It was a common feature of castles, and most had at least one.
Water was supplied by a well or cistern.
Although often associated with the motte-and-bailey type of castle, baileys could also be found as independent defensive structures.
Keep" was not a term used in the medieval period – the term was applied from the 16th century onwards – instead "donjon" was used to refer to great towers, or turris in Latin.
Although often the strongest part of a castle and a last place of refuge if the outer defences fell, the keep was not left empty in case of attack but was used as a residence by the lord who owned the castle, or his guests or representatives.
Walkways along the tops of the curtain walls allowed defenders to rain missiles on enemies below, and battlements gave them further protection.
The front of the gateway was a blind spot and to overcome this, projecting towers were added on each side of the gate in a style similar to that developed by the Romans.
The passage through the gatehouse was lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant had to spend under fire in a confined space and unable to retaliate.
They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them.
A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming.
The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls.
Many earthworks survive today, along with evidence of palisades to accompany the ditches.
Although primitive, they were often effective, and were only overcome by the extensive use of siege engines and other siege warfare techniques, such as at the Battle of Alesia.
Discussions have typically attributed the rise of the castle to a reaction to attacks by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings and a need for private defence.
Some high concentrations of castles occur in secure places, while some border regions had relatively few castles.
Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door.
Castles were not just defensive sites but also enhanced a lord's control over his lands.
In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed.
Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country.
In 950 Provence was home to 12 castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100.
In the early 11th century, the motte and keep – an artificial mound with a palisade and tower on top – was the most common form of castle in Europe, everywhere except Scandinavia.
Although stone construction would later become common elsewhere, from the 11th century onwards it was the primary building material for Christian castles in Spain, while at the same time timber was still the dominant building material in north-west Europe.
Before the 12th century castles were as uncommon in Denmark as they had been in England before the Norman Conquest.
Their decoration emulated Romanesque architecture, and sometimes incorporated double windows similar to those found in church bell towers.
Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork castles were by no means useless.
Until the late 12th century castles generally had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures).
The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.
Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical.
Probably developed in the 12th century, the towers provided flanking fire.
It seemed that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architecture.
Legends were discredited, and in the case of James of Saint George it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d'Espéranche, in France.
The castle builders of Western Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design; late Roman coastal forts on the English "Saxon Shore" were reused and in Spain the wall around the city of Ávila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091.
An example of this approach is Kerak.
The castles they founded to secure their acquisitions were designed mostly by Syrian master-masons.
While castles were used to hold a site and control movement of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified.
Design varied not just between orders, but between individual castles, though it was common for those founded in this period to have concentric defences.
If assailants made it past the first line of defence they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.
For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure.
Although there were hundreds of wooden castles in Prussia and Livonia, the use of bricks and mortar was unknown in the region before the Crusaders.
Arrowslits did not compromise the wall's strength, but it was not until Edward I's programme of castle building that they were widely adopted in Europe.
Although machicolations performed the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form.
Conflict and interaction between the two groups led to an exchange of architectural ideas, and Spanish Christians adopted the use of detached towers.
French historian François Gebelin wrote: "The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of William the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy.
The new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created such as that of Raglan in Wales.
These guns were too heavy for a man to carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge of the gun port he could fire the weapon.
This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands.
Other types of port, though less common, were horizontal slits – allowing only lateral movement – and large square openings, which allowed greater movement.
Ham is an example of the trend for new castles to dispense with earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.
In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles.
While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had to find a way to cope with being battered by cannon.
A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from.
From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne.
The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon.
Some true castles were built in the Americas by the Spanish and French colonies.
Among other defensive structures (including forts and citadels), castles were also built in New France towards the end of the 17th century.
The manor house and stables were within a fortified bailey, with a tall round turret in each corner.
Although castle construction faded towards the end of the 16th century, castles did not necessarily all fall out of use.
In other cases they still had a role in defence.
In later conflicts, such as the English Civil War (1641–1651), many castles were refortified, although subsequently slighted to prevent them from being used again.
Revival or mock castles became popular as a manifestation of a Romantic interest in the Middle Ages and chivalry, and as part of the broader Gothic Revival in architecture.
This was because to be faithful to medieval design would have left the houses cold and dark by contemporary standards.
Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built.
A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an unskilled workforce.
The cost of building a castle varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material.
In the middle were castles such as Orford, which was built in the late 12th century for UK£1,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about UK£7,000 between 1181 and 1191.
The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from UK£1,000 to UK£10,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting a lord's finances.
Medieval machines and inventions, such as the treadwheel crane, became indispensable during construction, and techniques of building wooden scaffolding were improved upon from Antiquity.
Many countries had both timber and stone castles, however Denmark had few quarries and as a result most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick.
For example, when Tattershall Castle was built between 1430 and 1450, there was plenty of stone available nearby, but the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick.
He relied on the support of those below him, as without the support of his more powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined.
This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.
Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although on a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious.
As social centres castles were important places for display.
Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features.
Courtly love was the eroticisation of love between the nobility.
The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages.
The purpose of marriage between the medieval elites was to secure land.
This derives from the image of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domestic life is a neglected facet.
For instance many castles are located near Roman roads, which remained important transport routes in the Middle Ages, or could lead to the alteration or creation of new road systems in the area.
Urban castles were particularly important in controlling centres of population and production, especially with an invading force, for instance in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th century the majority of royal castles were built in or near towns.
Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems due to their role in managing the lord's estate, which gave them greater influence over resources.
Not only were they practical in that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.
The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe.
Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences.
They were usually located near any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structures occupying the desired site.
When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11th and 12th centuries, settlement in those countries was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns was often linked with the creation of a castle.
This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, one of the most important institutions of medieval society.
Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining.
Garrisons were expensive and as a result often small unless the castle was important.
In 1403, a force of 37 archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glyndŵr's allies during a long siege, demonstrating that a small force could be effective.
Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted as a type of officer class.
It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites.
A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later.
If forced to assault a castle, there were many options available to the attackers.
The trebuchet, which probably evolved from the petraria in the 13th century, was the most effective siege weapon before the development of cannons.
Ballistas or springalds were siege engines that worked on the same principles as crossbows.
They were more commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of a castle.
A mine leading to the wall would be dug and once the target had been reached, the wooden supports preventing the tunnel from collapsing would be burned.
A counter-mine could be dug towards the besiegers' tunnel; assuming the two converged, this would result in underground hand-to-hand combat.
They were used to force open the castle gates, although they were sometimes used against walls with less effect.
A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry.
The estates of the realm, or three estates, were the broad orders of social hierarchy used in Christendom (Christian Europe) from the Middle Ages to early modern Europe.
The monarchy included the king and the queen, while the system was made up of clergy (the First Estate), nobles (Second Estate), peasants and bourgeoisie (Third Estate).
In England, a two-estate system evolved that combined nobility and clergy into one lordly estate with "commons" as the second estate.
In Scotland, the Three Estates were the Clergy (First Estate), Nobility (Second Estate), and Shire Commissioners, or "burghers" (Third Estate), representing the bourgeois, middle class, and lower class.
Since clergy could not marry, such mobility was theoretically limited to one generation.
Huizinga The Waning of the Middle Ages (1919, 1924:47).
Commoners were universally considered the lowest order.
In many regions and realms there also existed population groups born outside these specifically defined resident estates.
The economic and political transformation of the countryside in the period were filled by a large growth in population, agricultural production, technological innovations and urban centers; movements of reform and renewal attempted to sharpen the distinction between clerical and lay status, and power, recognized by the Church also had their effect.
The second order, those who fight, was the rank of the politically powerful, ambitious, and dangerous.
In addition, the First and Second Estates relied on the labour of the Third, which made the latter's inferior status all the more glaring.
Most were born within this group and also died as a part of it.
In May 1776, finance minister Turgot was dismissed, after failing to enact reforms.
When he could not persuade them to rubber-stamp his 'ideal program', Louis XVI sought to dissolve the Estates-General, but the Third Estate held out for their right to representation.
Because the Parliament of Scotland was unicameral, all members sat in the same chamber, as opposed to the separate English House of Lords and House of Commons.
As in England, the Parliament of Ireland evolved out of the Magnum Concilium "great council" summoned by the chief governor of Ireland, attended by the council (curia regis), magnates (feudal lords), and prelates (bishops and abbots).
In 1297, counties were first represented by elected knights of the shire (sheriffs had previously represented them).
Each were free men, and had specific rights and responsibilities, and the right to send representatives to the Riksdag of the Estates.
Prior to the 18th century, the King had the right to cast a deciding vote if the Estates were split evenly.
However, after the Diet of Porvoo, the Diet of Finland was reconvened only in 1863.
Around 1400, letters patent were introduced, in 1561 the ranks of Count and Baron were added, and in 1625 the House of Nobility was codified as the First Estate of the land.
Heads of the noble houses were hereditary members of the assembly of nobles.
This resulted in great political influence for the higher nobility.
In later centuries, the estate included teachers of universities and certain state schools.
Trade was allowed only in the cities when the mercantilistic ideology had got the upper hand, and the burghers had the exclusive right to conduct commerce within the framework of guilds.
In order for a settlement to become a city, a royal charter granting market right was required, and foreign trade required royally chartered staple port rights.
Since most of the population were independent farmer families until the 19th century, not serfs nor villeins, there is a remarkable difference in tradition compared to other European countries.
Their representatives to the Diet were elected indirectly: each municipality sent electors to elect the representative of an electoral district.
They had no political rights and could not vote.
In Sweden, the Riksdag of the Estates existed until it was replaced with a bicameral Riksdag in 1866, which gave political rights to anyone with a certain income or property.
In Finland, this legal division existed until 1906, still drawing on the Swedish constitution of 1772.
Furthermore, the industrial workers living in the city were not represented by the four-estate system.
Later in the 15th and 16th centuries Brussels became the place where the States General assembled.
As a consequence of the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and the events that followed afterwards, the States General declared that they no longer obeyed King Philip II of Spain, who was also overlord of the Netherlands.
It was the level of government where all things were dealt with that were of concern to all the seven provinces that became part of the Republic of the United Netherlands.
In the Southern Netherlands, the last meetings of the States General loyal to the Habsburgs took place in the Estates General of 1600 and the Estates General of 1632.
It no longer consisted of representatives of the States, let alone the Estates: all men were considered equal under the 1798 Constitution.
In 1815, when the Netherlands were united with Belgium and Luxemburg, the States General were divided into two chambers: the First Chamber and the Second Chamber.
From 1848 on, the Dutch Constitution provides that members of the Second Chamber be elected by the people (at first only by a limited portion of the male population; universal male and female suffrage exists since 1919), while the members of the First Chamber are chosen by the members of the States Provincial.
The clergy was represented by the independent prince-bishops, prince-archbishops and prince-abbots of the many monasteries.
Many peoples whose territories within the Holy Roman Empire had been independent for centuries had no representatives in the Imperial Diet, and this included the Imperial Knights and independent villages.
The four major estates were: nobility (dvoryanstvo), clergy, rural dwellers, and urban dwellers, with a more detailed stratification therein.
The bourgeoisie in its original sense is intimately linked to the existence of cities, recognized as such by their urban charters (e.g., municipal charters, town privileges, German town law), so there was no bourgeoisie apart from the citizenry of the cities.
Historically, the medieval French word bourgeois denoted the inhabitants of the bourgs (walled market-towns), the craftsmen, artisans, merchants, and others, who constituted "the bourgeoisie".
Guilds arose when individual businessmen (such as craftsmen, artisans and merchants) conflicted with their rent-seeking feudal landlords who demanded greater rents than previously agreed.
They tend to belong to a family that has been bourgeois for three or more generations.
The names of these families are generally known in the city where they reside, and their ancestors have often contributed to the region's history.
These people nevertheless live lavishly, enjoying the company of the great artists of the time.
In the French language, the term bourgeoisie almost designates a caste by itself, even though social mobility into this socio-economic group is possible.
Hitler distrusted capitalism for being unreliable due to its egotism, and he preferred a state-directed economy that is subordinated to the interests of the Volk.
Hitler also said that the business bourgeoisie "know nothing except their profit".
The utility of these things was inherent in their practical functions.
Belle de Jour (Beauty of the day, 1967) tells the story of a bourgeois wife who is bored with her marriage and decides to prostitute herself.
In Europe, the title of Emperor has been used since the Middle Ages, considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of Western Europe.
In as much as there is a strict definition of emperor, it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation.
Their status was officially recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1514, although not officially used by the Russian monarchs until 1547.
Such pre-Roman titles as Great King or King of Kings, used by the Kings of Persia and others, are often considered as the equivalent.
Empire became identified instead with vast territorial holdings rather than the title of its ruler by the mid-18th century.
Ancient Romans abhorred the name Rex ("king"), and it was critical to the political order to maintain the forms and pretenses of republican rule.
Augustus, considered the first Roman emperor, established his hegemony by collecting on himself offices, titles, and honours of Republican Rome that had traditionally been distributed to different people, concentrating what had been distributed power in one man.
However, it was the informal descriptive of Imperator ("commander") that became the title increasingly favored by his successors.
This is one of the most enduring titles: Caesar and its transliterations appeared in every year from the time of Caesar Augustus to Tsar Simeon II of Bulgaria's removal from the throne in 1946.
Exceptions include the title of the Augustan History, a semi-historical collection of Emperors' biographies of the 2nd and 3rd century.
Few were however granted the title, and it was certainly not a rule that all wives of reigning Emperors would receive it.
In the late Republic, as in the early years of the new monarchy, Imperator was a title granted to Roman generals by their troops and the Roman Senate after a great victory, roughly comparable to field marshal (head or commander of the entire army).
The succeeding Nervan-Antonian Dynasty, ruling for most of the 2nd century, stabilised the Empire.
Three short lived secessionist attempts had their own emperors: the Gallic Empire, the Britannic Empire, and the Palmyrene Empire though the latter used rex more regularly.
At one point, there were as many as five sharers of the imperium (see: Tetrarchy).
The city is more commonly called Constantinople and is today named Istanbul).
These Later Roman "Byzantine" Emperors completed the transition from the idea of the Emperor as a semi-republican official to the Emperor as an absolute monarch.
Byzantine period emperors also used the Greek word "autokrator", meaning "one who rules himself", or "monarch", which was traditionally used by Greek writers to translate the Latin dictator.
In fact, none of these (and other) additional epithets and titles had ever been completely discarded.
Following the tragedy of the horrific sacking of the city, the conquerors declared a new "Empire of Romania", known to historians as the Latin Empire of Constantinople, installing Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders, as Emperor.
From the time of Otto the Great onward, much of the former Carolingian kingdom of Eastern Francia became the Holy Roman Empire.
This junior King then bore the title of Roman King (King of the Romans).
The Holy Roman Emperor was considered the first among those in power.
Geography is often defined in terms of two branches: human geography and physical geography.
Traditionally, geography has been associated with cartography and place names.
Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as economics, health, climate, plants and animals, geography is highly interdisciplinary.
The former largely focuses on the built environment and how humans create, view, manage, and influence space.
It requires an understanding of the traditional aspects of physical and human geography, like the ways that human societies conceptualize the environment.
The study of systems larger than the Earth itself usually forms part of Astronomy or Cosmology.
Regional science: In the 1950s, the regional science movement led by Walter Isard arose to provide a more quantitative and analytical base to geographical questions, in contrast to the descriptive tendencies of traditional geography programs.
Cartography has grown from a collection of drafting techniques into an actual science.
In addition to all of the other subdisciplines of geography, GIS specialists must understand computer science and database systems.
Geostatistics is used extensively in a variety of fields, including hydrology, geology, petroleum exploration, weather analysis, urban planning, logistics, and epidemiology.
The map as reconstructed by Eckhard Unger shows Babylon on the Euphrates, surrounded by a circular landmass showing Assyria, Urartu, and several cities, in turn surrounded by a "bitter river" (Oceanus), with seven islands arranged around it so as to form a seven-pointed star.
In contrast to the Imago Mundi, an earlier Babylonian world map dating back to the 9th century BC depicted Babylon as being further north from the center of the world, though it is not certain what that center was supposed to represent.
Thales is also credited with the prediction of eclipses.
There is some debate about who was the first person to assert that the Earth is spherical in shape, with the credit going either to Parmenides or Pythagoras.
One of the first estimates of the radius of the Earth was made by Eratosthenes.
The meridians were sub-divided into 360°, with each degree further subdivided into 60 (minutes).
He extended the work of Hipparchus, using a grid system on his maps and adopting a length of 56.5 miles for a degree.
During the Middle Ages, the fall of the Roman empire led to a shift in the evolution of geography from Europe to the Islamic world.
Further, Islamic scholars translated and interpreted the earlier works of the Romans and the Greeks and established the House of Wisdom in Baghdad for this purpose.
Abu Rayhan Biruni (976–1048) first described a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere.
He also developed similar techniques when it came to measuring the heights of mountains, depths of the valleys, and expanse of the horizon.
The problem facing both explorers and geographers was finding the latitude and longitude of a geographic location.
The 18th and the 19th centuries were the times when geography became recognized as a discrete academic discipline, and became part of a typical university curriculum in Europe (especially Paris and Berlin).
Over the past two centuries, the advancements in technology with computers have led to the development of geomatics and new practices such as participant observation and geostatistics being incorporated into geography's portfolio of tools.
Arnold Henry Guyot (1807–1884) – noted the structure of glaciers and advanced understanding in glacier motion, especially in fast ice flow.
William Morris Davis (1850–1934) – father of American geography and developer of the cycle of erosion.
Ellen Churchill Semple (1863–1932) – first female president of the Association of American Geographers.
Walter Christaller (1893–1969) – human geographer and inventor of Central place theory.
David Harvey (born 1935) – Marxist geographer and author of theories on spatial and urban geography, winner of the Vautrin Lud Prize.
In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place.
Examples are ancient Babylon, Abbasid Baghdad, ancient Athens, Rome, Bratislava, Budapest, Constantinople, Chang'an, ancient Cusco, Kyiv, Madrid, Paris, Podgorica, London, Beijing, Prague, Tallinn, Tokyo, Lisbon, Riga, Vilnius, and Warsaw.
In some countries, the capital has been changed for geopolitical reasons; Finland's first city, Turku, which had served as the country's capital since the Middle Ages under the Swedish rule, lost its right during the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812, when Helsinki was made the current capital of Finland by the Russian Empire.
In Canada, there is a federal capital, while the ten provinces and three territories each have capital cities.
In Australia, the term "capital cities" is regularly used to refer to those six state capitals plus the federal capital Canberra, and Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory.
Unlike in federations, there is usually not a separate national capital, but rather the capital city of one constituent nation will also be the capital of the state overall, such as London, which is the capital of England and of the United Kingdom.
The national capitals of Germany and Russia (the Stadtstaat of Berlin and the federal city of Moscow) are also constituent states of both countries in their own right.
Frankfort, Kentucky, midway between Louisville and Lexington.
Tallahassee, Florida, chosen as the midpoint between Pensacola and St. Augustine, Florida – then the two largest cities in Florida.
Changes in a nation's political regime sometimes result in the designation of a new capital.
When the Canary Islands became an autonomous community in 1982, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria were both given capital status.
Estonia: the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Education and Research are located in Tartu.
In case of emergency, the seat of the constitutional powers can be transferred to another town, in order for the Houses of Parliament to sit in the same location as the President and Cabinet.
The entire state machinery shifts from one city to another every six months.
Dharamshala, which is also the headquarters of the Central Tibetan Administration, is the second winter capital of the state.
The city itself is administered as a Union territory.
Uttarakhand: Dehradun is the administrative and legislative capital, while the high court is located in Nainital.
Its construction started in 1960 and was completed in 1966.
The presidential palace (Malacanang Palace) and the Supreme Court are located within the capital city but the two houses of Congress are located in separate suburbs.
Sri Lanka: Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is designated the administrative capital and the location of the parliament, while the former capital, Colombo, is now designated as the "commercial capital".
South Africa: The administrative capital is Pretoria, the legislative capital is Cape Town, and the judicial capital is Bloemfontein.
Switzerland: Bern is the Federal City of Switzerland and functions as de facto capital.
Also similar to Illinois and New York State, most statewide elected officials and officers who are based in Southeast Pennsylvania (City of Philadelphia, Bucks County, Montgomery County, Delaware County, and Chester County) prefer working mostly in Philadelphia.
Israel and Palestine: Both the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital.
A symbolic relocation of a capital city to a geographically or demographically peripheral location may be for either economic or strategic reasons (sometimes known as a forward capital or spearhead capital).
The Ming emperors moved their capital to Beijing from the more central Nanjing to help supervise the border with the Mongols.
Delhi finally became the colonial capital after the Coronation Durbar of King-Emperor George V in 1911, continuing as independent India's capital from 1947.
Sometimes, the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate actual or potential squabbling between various entities, such as in the cases of Canberra, Ottawa, Washington, Wellington and Managua.
In the Three Kingdoms period, both Shu and Wu fell when their respective capitals of Chengdu and Jianye fell.
After the Qing dynasty's collapse, decentralization of authority and improved transportation and communication technologies allowed both the Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists to rapidly relocate capitals and keep their leadership structures intact during the great crisis of Japanese invasion.
It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks.
Historically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, more than half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability.
This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues, such as sustainable development, global warming and global health.
Therefore, compact cities are often referred to as a crucial element of fighting climate change.
For example, country capitals such as Beijing, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, Athens, Seoul, Tokyo, and Washington, D.C. reflect the identity and apex of their respective nations.
The city may be looked on as a story, a pattern of relations between human groups, a production and distribution space, a field of physical force, a set of linked decisions, or an arena of conflict.
National censuses use a variety of definitions - invoking factors such as population, population density, number of dwellings, economic function, and infrastructure - to classify populations as urban.
The mutual interdependence of town and country has one consequence so obvious that it is easily overlooked: at the global scale, cities are generally confined to areas capable of supporting a permanent agricultural population.
As cities grew in complexity, the major civic institutions, from seats of government to religious buildings, would also come to dominate these points of convergence.
Physical environment generally constrains the form in which a city is built.
And it may be set up for optimal defense given the surrounding landscape.
This form could evolve from successive growth over a long time, with concentric traces of town walls and citadels marking older city boundaries.
In cities such as Moscow, this pattern is still clearly visible.
Excavations in these areas have found the ruins of cities geared variously towards trade, politics, or religion.
China's planned cities were constructed according to sacred principles to act as celestial microcosms.
These sites appear planned in a highly regimented and stratified fashion, with a minimalistic grid of rooms for the workers and increasingly more elaborate housing available for higher classes.
In the following centuries, independent city-states of Greece, especially Athens, developed the polis, an association of male landowning citizens who collectively constituted the city.
Under the authority of its empire, Rome transformed and founded many cities (coloniae), and with them brought its principles of urban architecture, design, and society.
The Norte Chico civilization included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the Norte Chico region of north-central coastal Peru.
The locus of power in the West shifted to Constantinople and to the ascendant Islamic civilization with its major cities Baghdad, Cairo, and Córdoba.
By the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, some cities become powerful states, taking surrounding areas under their control or establishing extensive maritime empires.
Western Europe's larger capitals (London and Paris) benefited from the growth of commerce following the emergence of an Atlantic trade.
England led the way as London became the capital of a world empire and cities across the country grew in locations strategic for manufacturing.
Entrepreneurial leadership became manifest through growth coalitions made up of builders, realtors, developers, the media, government actors such as mayors, and dominant corporations.
The results were efforts at downtown revitalization; inner-city gentrification; the transformation of the CBD to advanced service employment; entertainment, museums, and cultural venues; the construction of sports stadiums and sport complexes; and waterfront development."
Until the 18th century, an equilibrium existed between the rural agricultural population and towns featuring markets and small-scale manufacturing.
The cultural appeal of cities also plays a role in attracting residents.
Batam, Indonesia, Mogadishu, Somalia, Xiamen, China and Niamey, Niger, are considered among the world's fastest-growing cities, with annual growth rates of 5–8%.
The UN predicts an additional 2.5 billion citydwellers (and 300 million fewer countrydwellers) worldwide by 2050, with 90% of urban population expansion occurring in Asia and Africa.
A deep gulf divides rich and poor in these cities, with usually contain a super-wealthy elite living in gated communities and large masses of people living in substandard housing with inadequate infrastructure and otherwise poor conditions.
Yet municipalities routinely enact sweeping by-laws directed at open ended (and ill-defined) offences such as loitering and obstruction, requiring permits for protests or requiring residents and homeowners to remove snow from the city's sidewalks."
These are provided more or less routinely, in a more or less equal fashion.
These production oriented criteria often give rise to "service deliver rules", regularized procedures for the delivery of services, which are attempts to codify the productivity goals of urban service bureaucracies.
Robert L. Lineberry, "Mandating Urban Equality: The Distribution of Municipal Public Services"; in Hahn & Levine (1980).
However, financing municipal services, as well as urban renewal and other development projects, is a perennial problem, which cities address through appeals to higher governments, arrangements with the private sector, and techniques such as privatization (selling services into the private sector), corporatization (formation of quasi-private municipally-owned corporations), and financialization (packaging city assets into tradable financial instruments and derivatives).
The impact of globalization and the role of multinational corporations in local governments worldwide, has led to a shift in perspective on urban governance, away from the "urban regime theory" in which a coalition of local interests functionally govern, toward a theory of outside economic control, widely associated in academics with the philosophy of neoliberalism.
Planning tools, beyond the original design of the city itself, include public capital investment in infrastructure and land-use controls such as zoning.
Also available to cities in their implementation of planning objectives are municipal powers of zoning, subdivision control and the regulation of building, housing and sanitation principles."
People living relatively close together may live, work, and play, in separate areas, and associate with different people, forming ethnic or lifestyle enclaves or, in areas of concentrated poverty, ghettoes.
Suburbs in the west, and, increasingly, gated communities and other forms of "privatopia" around the world, allow local elites to self-segregate into secure and exclusive neighborhoods.
This outcast proletariat—perhaps 1.5 billion people today, 2.5 billion by 2030—is the fastest-growing and most novel social class on the planet.
It is ontologically both similar and dissimilar to the historical agency described in the Communist Manifesto.
As hubs of trade cities have long been home to retail commerce and consumption through the interface of shopping.
A thicker labor market allows for better skill matching between firms and individuals.
Cultural elites tend to live in cities, bound together by shared cultural capital, and themselves playing some role in governance.

Patriotic tourists visit Agra to see the Taj Mahal, or New York City to visit the World Trade Center.
Why do anonymous people—the poor, the underprivileged, the unconnected—frequently prefer life under miserable conditions in tenements to the healthy order and tranquility of small towns or the sanitary subdivisions of semirural developments?
Those who came to live in them did so in order to participate and compete on any attainable level.
Sports also play a major role in city branding and local identity formation.
More importantly, there is also huge long term potential for both tourism and investment (Kasimati, 2003).
War brought concentration of social leadership and political power in the hands of a weapons-bearing minority, abetted by a priesthood exercising sacred powers and possessing secret but valuable scientific and magical knowledge."
During World War II, national governments on occasion declared certain cities open, effectively surrendering them to an advancing enemy in order to avoid damage and bloodshed.
Such warfare, known as counterinsurgency, involves techniques of surveillance and psychological warfare as well as close combat, functionally extends modern urban crime prevention, which already uses concepts such as defensible space.
Because of the higher barriers to entry, these networks have been classified as natural monopolies, meaning that economic logic favors control of each network by a single organization, public or private.
Kath Wellman & Frederik Pretorius, "Urban Infrastructure: Productivity, Project Evaluation, and Finance"; in Wellman & Spiller (2012).
Sanitation, necessary for good health in crowded conditions, requires water supply and waste management as well as individual hygiene.
Modern urban life relies heavily on the energy transmitted through electricity for the operation of electric machines (from household appliances to industrial machines to now-ubiquitous electronic systems used in communications, business, and government) and for traffic lights, streetlights and indoor lighting.
Tom Hart, "Transport and the City"; in Paddison (2001).
Many big American cities still operate conventional public transit by rail, as exemplified by the ever-popular New York City Subway system.
Anthropogenic buildings and waste, as well as cultivation in gardens, create physical and chemical environments which have no equivalents in wilderness, in some cases enabling exceptional biodiversity.
From one perspective, cities are not ecologically sustainable due to their resource needs.
Modern cities are known for creating their own microclimates, due to concrete, asphalt, and other artificial surfaces, which heat up in sunlight and channel rainwater into underground ducts.
Aerial particulates increase rainfall by 5–10%.
For example, within the urban microclimate, less-vegetated poor neighborhoods bear more of the heat (but have fewer means of coping with it).
Generally they are called Urban open space (although this word does not always mean green space), Green space, Urban greening.
The study used data from almost 20,000 people in the UK.
People who did not get at least two hours — even if they surpassed an hour per week — did not get the benefits.
The study didn't count time spent in a person's own yard or garden as time in nature, but the majority of nature visits in the study took place within two miles from home. "
Saskia Sassen used the term "global city" in her 1991 work, The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo to refer to a city's power, status, and cosmopolitanism, rather than to its size.
3 (1982): 319 Global cities form the capstone of the global hierarchy, exerting command and control through their economic and political influence.
Critics of the notion point to the different realms of power and interchange.
Multinational corporations and banks make their headquarters in global cities and conduct much of their business within this context.

The Bank's policies have tended to focus on bolstering real estate markets through credit and technical assistance.
Cities figure prominently in traditional Western culture, appearing in the Bible in both evil and holy forms, symbolized by Babylon and Jerusalem.
Cities can be perceived in terms of extremes or opposites: at once liberating and oppressive, wealthy and poor, organized and chaotic.
This and other political ideologies strongly influence narratives and themes in discourse about cities.
Classical and medieval literature includes a genre of descriptiones which treat of city features and history.
Other early cinematic representations of cities in the twentieth century generally depicted them as technologically efficient spaces with smoothly functioning systems of automobile transport.
A country is a distinct territorial body or political entity (i.e. a nation).
It is not inherently sovereign.
The largest country in the world by geographical area is Russia, while the most populous is China, followed by India, the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan and Brazil.
In many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the German Bundesländer, as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state.
There is no universal agreement on the number of "countries" in the world since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status.
The degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely.
The report classifies country development based on per capita gross national income (GNI).
The 2019 report recognizes only developed countries in North America, Europe, and Asia and the Pacific.

Exploration is the act of searching for the purpose of discovery of information or resources, especially in the context of geography or space, rather than research and development that is usually not centred on earth sciences or astronomy.
Only the one done by emperor Nero seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of Ethiopia or Nubia: in 62 AD two legionaries explored the sources of the Nile river.
The Romans also organized several explorations into Northern Europe, and explored as far as China in Asia.
100 AD-166 AD Romano-Chinese relations begin.
The key invention to their exploration was the outrigger canoe, which provided a swift and stable platform for carrying goods and people.
2011 studies at Wairau Bar in New Zealand show a high probability that one origin was Ruahine Island in the Society Islands.
There are cultural and language similarities between Cook Islanders and New Zealand Maori.
During 1328–1333, he sailed along the South China Sea and visited many places in Southeast Asia and reached as far as South Asia, landing in Sri Lanka and India, and he even went to Australia.
Portugal and Spain dominated the first stages of exploration, while other European nations followed, such as England, Netherlands, and France.
The extreme conditions in the deep sea require elaborate methods and technologies to endure them.
An administrative subdivision, instead, is understood to be a division of a state proper.
The dependent territories that currently remain in the world today generally maintain a very high degree of political autonomy.
Cook Islands' status is considered to be equivalent to independence for international law purposes, and the country exercises full sovereignty over its internal and external affairs.
Under the terms of the free association agreement, however, New Zealand retains some responsibility for the foreign relations and defence of Niue.
This list is generally limited to entities that are either subject to an international treaty on their status, uninhabited, or have a unique level of autonomy and are largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs.
They are independently administrated jurisdictions, although the British Government is solely responsible for defense and international representation and has ultimate responsibility for ensuring good government.

However, the status of its "constituent countries" in the Caribbean (Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten) can be considered akin to dependencies or "associated non-independent states."
Borders are geographic boundaries, imposed either by geographic features such as oceans, or by arbitrary groupings of political entities such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities.
Most external borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled.
Most countries have some form of border control to regulate or limit the movement of people, animals, and goods into and out of the country.
To stay or work within a country's borders aliens (foreign persons) may need special immigration documents or permits; but possession of such documents does not guarantee that the person should be allowed to cross the border.
Most countries prohibit carrying illegal drugs or endangered animals across their borders.
In places where smuggling, migration, and infiltration are a problem, many countries fortify borders with fences and barriers, and institute formal border control procedures.
This is common in countries within the European Schengen Area and on rural sections of the Canada–United States border.
Rivers: some political borders have been formalized along natural borders formed by rivers.
In the Hebrew Bible, Moses defined the middle of the river Arnon as the border between Moab and the Israelite tribes settling east of the Jordan.
Examples are Lake Tanganyika, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia on its west shore and Tanzania and Burundi on the east; and the Great Lakes which form a substantial part of the border between Canada and the United States.
Mountain ranges: Many nations have their political borders defined along mountain ranges, often along a drainage divide.
One example is the defensive forest created by China's Song Dynasty in the eleventh century.
For instance, the boundary between East and West Germany is no longer an international boundary, but it can still be seen because of historical markers on the landscape, and it is still a cultural and economic division in Germany.
Maritime borders exist in the context of territorial waters, contiguous zones, and exclusive economic zones; however, the terminology does not encompass lake or river boundaries, which are considered within the context of land boundaries.
Airspace extends 12 nautical miles from the coast of a country and it holds responsibility for protecting its own airspace unless under NATO peacetime protection.
However, there is a general agreement of vertical airspace ending at the point of the Kármán line.

It can enable and stop movement, across as well as along borders.
Many cross-border regions are also active in encouraging intercultural communication and dialogue as well as cross-border economic development strategies.
Since its conception in the mid-80's, this artistic practice has assisted in the development of questions surrounding homeland, borders, surveillance, identity, race, ethnicity, and national origin(s).
Borders can include but are not limited to language, culture, social and economic class, religion, and national identity.
These artists are often "border crossers" themselves.
In general, a rural area or a countryside is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities.
Typical rural areas have a low population density and small settlements.
Predominantly urban regions have less than 15 percent of their population living in a rural community.
Rural northern regions are predominantly rural census divisions that are found either entirely or mostly above the following lines of parallel in each province: Newfoundland and Labrador, 50th; Quebec 54th; Ontario, 54th; Manitoba, 53rd; Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, 54th.

This became the Goldsmith Modification definition of rural. "
President Emmanuel Macron government launched an action plan in 2019 in favour for rural areas named "Agenda Rural".
In Scotland a different definition of rural is used.
RBI defines rural areas as those areas with a population of less than 49,000 (tier -3 to tier-6 cities).
Rural areas in Pakistan that are near cities are considered as suburban areas or suburbs.
Suburbs might have their own political or legal jurisdiction, especially in the United States, but this is not always the case, especially in the United Kingdom where most suburbs are located within the administrative boundaries of cities.
In others, such as Morocco, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed locally as part of a larger metropolitan area such as a county, district or borough.
The terms inner suburb and outer suburb are used to differentiate between the higher-density areas in proximity to the city centre (which would not be referred to as 'suburbs' in most other countries), and the lower-density suburbs on the outskirts of the urban area.
In New Zealand, most suburbs are not legally defined, which can lead to confusion as to where they may begin and end.
The word suburbani was first employed by the Roman statesman Cicero in reference to the large villas and estates built by the wealthy patricians of Rome on the city's outskirts.
By the mid-19th century, the first major suburban areas were springing up around London as the city (then the largest in the world) became more overcrowded and unsanitary.
The line reached Harrow in 1880.

In part, this was a response to the shocking lack of fitness amongst many recruits during World War One, attributed to poor living conditions; a belief summed up in a housing poster of the period "you cannot expect to get an A1 population out of C3 homes" – referring to military fitness classifications of the period.
The Report also legislated on the required, minimum standards necessary for further suburban construction; this included regulation on the maximum housing density and their arrangement and it even made recommendations on the ideal number of bedrooms and other rooms per house.
Within just a decade suburbs dramatically increased in size.
Levittown developed as a major prototype of mass-produced housing.
Shopping for different goods and services in one central location without having to travel to multiple locations, helped to keep shopping centers a component of these newly designed suburbs which were booming in population.
The Highway Act of 1956 helped to fund the building of 64,000 kilometers across the nation by having $26 thousand-million to use, which helped to link many more to these shopping centers with ease.
Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown.
The product was a great housing boom.
With 16 million eligible veterans, the opportunity to buy a house was suddenly at hand.
Developers purchased empty land just outside the city, installed tract houses based on a handful of designs, and provided streets and utilities, or local public officials race to build schools.
Veterans could get one with a much lower down payment.
The growth of the suburbs was facilitated by the development of zoning laws, redlining and numerous innovations in transport.
African-Americans and other people of color largely remained concentrated within decaying cores of urban poverty.
After World War II, availability of FHA loans stimulated a housing boom in American suburbs.
Economic growth in the United States encouraged the suburbanization of American cities that required massive investments for the new infrastructure and homes.
An alternative strategy is the deliberate design of "new towns" and the protection of green belts around cities.
Federal subsidies for suburban development accelerated this process as did the practice of redlining by banks and other lending institutions.
Virginia Beach is now the largest city in all of Virginia, having long since exceeded the population of its neighboring primary city, Norfolk.
A greater percentage of whites (both non-Hispanic and, in some areas, Hispanic) and lesser percentage of citizens of other ethnic groups than in urban areas.
Compared to rural areas, suburbs usually have greater population density, higher standards of living, more complex road systems, more franchised stores and restaurants, and less farmland and wildlife.
However, of this metropolitan population, in 2001 nearly half lived in low-density neighborhoods, with only one in five living in a typical "urban" neighborhood.
Throughout Canada, there are comprehensive plans in place to curb sprawl.
The majority of recent population growth in Canada's three largest metropolitan areas (Greater Toronto, Greater Montréal, and Greater Vancouver) has occurred in non-core municipalities.
This is due to annexation and large geographic footprint within the city borders.
In the 2016 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,239,220, whereas the Calgary Metropolitan Area had a population of 1,392,609, indicating the vast majority of people in the Calgary CMA lived within the city limits.

Suburbs can be found in Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey, and most major cities.
As the growth of middle-class and upper-class suburbs increased, low-class squatter areas have increased, most notably "lost cities" in Mexico, campamentos in Chile, barriadas in Peru, villa miserias in Argentina, asentamientos in Guatemala and favelas of Brazil.
In an illustrative case of South Africa, RDP housing has been built.
In certain areas such as Klang, Subang Jaya and Petaling Jaya, suburbs form the core of these places.
In the suburban system, most trips from one component to another component requires that cars enter a collector road, no matter how short or long the distance is.
If a traffic crash occurs on a collector road, or if road construction inhibits the flow, then the entire road system may be rendered useless until the blockage is cleared.
This encourages car trips even for distances as low as several hundreds of yards or meters (which may have become up to several miles or kilometers due to the road network).
Taken together, these two groups of taxpayers represent a largely untapped source of potential revenue that cities may begin to target more aggressively, particularly if they're struggling.
French songs like La Zone by Fréhel (1933), Aux quatre coins de la banlieue by Damia (1936), Ma banlieue by Reda Caire (1937), or Banlieue by Robert Lamoureux (1953), evoke the suburbs of Paris explicitly since the 1930s.
French cinema was although soon interested in urban changes in the suburbs, with such movies as Mon oncle by Jacques Tati (1958), L'Amour existe by Maurice Pialat (1961) or Two or Three Things I Know About Her by Jean-Luc Godard (1967).
The 1962 song "Little Boxes" by Malvina Reynolds lampoons the development of suburbia and its perceived bourgeois and conformist values, while the 1982 song Subdivisions by the Canadian band Rush also discusses suburbia, as does Rockin' the Suburbs by Ben Folds.
Over the Hedge is a syndicated comic strip written and drawn by Michael Fry and T. Lewis.
British television series such as The Good Life, Butterflies and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin have depicted suburbia as well-manicured but relentlessly boring, and its residents as either overly conforming or prone to going stir crazy.
A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town (although the word is often used to describe both hamlets and smaller towns), with a population typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand.
This also enabled specialization of labor and crafts, and development of many trades.
The size of these villages varies considerably.
Desa are generally located in rural areas while kelurahan are generally urban subdivisions.
A desa or kelurahan is the subdivision of a kecamatan (subdistrict), in turn the subdivision of a kabupaten (district) or kota (city).
In Malaysia, a kampung is determined as a locality with 10,000 or fewer people.
All Muslims in the Malay or Indonesian village want to be prayed for, and to receive Allah's blessings in the afterlife.

Vietnam's village is the typical symbol of Asian agricultural production.
In Slovenia, the word selo is used for very small villages (fewer than 100 people) and in dialects; the Slovene word vas is used all over Slovenia.
It could be relative to a Sanskrit like Afgan word deh and Indonesian word desa.
Approximately 46% of all migrated people have changed their residence from one city to another.
The lowest administrative unit of the Russian Empire, a volost, or its Soviet or modern Russian successor, a selsoviet, was typically headquartered in a selo and embraced a few neighboring villages.
While peasants of central Russia lived in a village around the lord's manor, a Cossack family often lived on its own farm, called khutor.
There is, however, another smaller type of settlement which is designated in Ukrainian as a selysche (селище).
They represent a type of a small rural locality that might have once been a khutir, a fisherman's settlement, or a dacha.
However, ambiguity is often avoided in connection with urbanized settlements by referring to them using the three-letter abbreviation smt instead.
They became really popular during the Stolypin reform in the early 20th century.
Larger villages can also be referred to as a Flecken or Markt depending on the region.
For example, in areas such as the Lincolnshire Wolds, the villages are often found along the spring line halfway down the hillsides, and originate as spring line settlements, with the original open field systems around the village.
Some villages have disappeared (for example, deserted medieval villages), sometimes leaving behind a church or manor house and sometimes nothing but bumps in the fields.
Other villages have grown and merged and often form hubs within the general mass of suburbia—such as Hampstead, London and Didsbury in Manchester.
Seen as being far from the bustle of modern life, it is represented as quiet and harmonious, if a little inward-looking.
These (such as Murton, County Durham) grew from hamlets when the sinking of a colliery in the early 20th century resulted in a rapid growth in their population and the colliery owners built new housing, shops, pubs and churches.
Maltby was constructed under the auspices of the Sheepbridge Coal and Iron Company and included ample open spaces and provision for gardens.

Villages in the south of Syria (Hauran, Jabal al-Druze), the north-east (the Syrian island) and the Orontes River basin depend mostly on agriculture, mainly grain, vegetables, and fruits.
Mediterranean cities in Syria, such as Tartus and Latakia have similar types of villages.
Every urbanization is a "pueblo" unless is elevated by decree to the next category.
However, this is a generality; in many states, there are villages that are an order of magnitude larger than the smallest cities in the state.
In some cases, the village may be coterminous with the town or township, in which case the two may have a consolidated government.
Hempstead, the largest village, has 55,000 residents; making it more populous than some of the state's cities.
The village of Arlington Heights, Illinois had 75,101 residents as of the 2010 census.
Villages can incorporate land in multiple townships and even multiple counties.
The largest village is Menomonee Falls, which has over 32,000 residents.

Every Hausa village was reigned by Magaji (Village head) who was answerable to his Hakimi (mayor) at the town level.
They have mud houses with thatched roofing though, like in most of the villages in the North, zinc roofing is becoming a common sight.
Others are lucky to have wells within a walking distance.
An atlas is a collection of maps; it is typically a bundle of maps of Earth or a region of Earth.
This title provides Mercator's definition of the word as a description of the creation and form of the whole universe, not simply as a collection of maps.
A desk atlas is made similar to a reference book.
In cartography, a contour line (often just called a "contour") joins points of equal elevation (height) above a given level, such as mean sea level.
The gradient of the function is always perpendicular to the contour lines.
Contour lines are curved, straight or a mixture of both lines on a map describing the intersection of a real or hypothetical surface with one or more horizontal planes.
In 1701, Edmond Halley used such lines (isogons) on a chart of magnetic variation.
In 1791, a map of France by J. L. Dupain-Triel used contour lines at 20-metre intervals, hachures, spot-heights and a vertical section.
Isobaths were not routinely used on nautical charts until those of Russia from 1834, and those of Britain from 1838.
As late as 1944, John K. Wright still preferred isogram, but it never attained wide usage.
Despite attempts to select a single standard, all of these alternatives have survived to the present.
Weather stations are seldom exactly positioned at a contour line (when they are, this indicates a measurement precisely equal to the value of the contour).
In meteorology, the barometric pressures shown are reduced to sea level, not the surface pressures at the map locations.
Isallobars are lines joining points of equal pressure change during a specific time interval.
Isallobaric gradients are important components of the wind as they increase or decrease the geostrophic wind.
An isotherm at 0 °C is called the freezing level.
From these contours, a sense of the general terrain can be determined.
In cartography, the contour interval is the elevation difference between adjacent contour lines.
Two or more contour lines merging indicates a cliff.
Usually contour intervals are consistent throughout a map, but there are exceptions.
Whether crossing an equipotential line represents ascending or descending the potential is inferred from the labels on the charges.
Acid precipitation is indicated on maps with isoplats.
Contour lines are also used to display non-geographic information in economics.
Such isolines are useful for representing more than two dimensions (or quantities) on two-dimensional graphs.
In interpreting radar images, an isodop is a line of equal Doppler velocity, and an isoecho is a line of equal radar reflectivity.
Line color is the choice of any number of pigments that suit the display.
Line type refers to whether the basic contour line is solid, dashed, dotted or broken in some other pattern to create the desired effect.
Numerical marking is the manner of denoting the arithmetical values of contour lines.
If the contour lines are not numerically labeled and adjacent lines have the same style (with the same weight, color and type), then the direction of the gradient cannot be determined from the contour lines alone.
A properly labeled contour map helps the reader to quickly interpret the shape of the terrain.
Then the coordinates of other places are measured from the nearest control point through surveying.
This phenomenon is called datum shift.
More ambitious undertakings such as the Struve Geodetic Arc across Eastern Europe (1816-1855) and the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India (1802-1871) took much longer, but resulted in more accurate estimations of the shape of the Earth ellipsoid.
An approximate definition of sea level is the datum WGS 84, an ellipsoid, whereas a more accurate definition is Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008), using at least 2,159 spherical harmonics.
When used without qualification, the term latitude refers to geodetic latitude.
The datum shift between two particular datums can vary from one place to another within one country or region, and can be anything from zero to hundreds of meters (or several kilometers for some remote islands).
For example, in Sydney there is a 200 metres (700 feet) difference between GPS coordinates configured in GDA (based on global standard WGS 84) and AGD (used for most local maps), which is an unacceptably large error for some applications, such as surveying or site location for scuba diving.
Since reference datums can have different radii and different center points, a specific point on Earth can have substantially different coordinates depending on the datum used to make the measurement.
The most common reference Datums in use in North America are NAD27, NAD83, and WGS 84.
This datum, designated as NAD 83 ...is based on the adjustment of 250,000 points including 600 satellite Doppler stations which constrain the system to a geocentric origin."
It is the reference frame used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and is defined by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) (formerly the Defense Mapping Agency, then the National Imagery and Mapping Agency).
It was used as the reference frame for broadcast GPS Ephemerides (orbits) beginning January 23, 1987.
It became the reference frame for broadcast orbits on June 28, 1994.
WGS 84 (G873) was adopted as the reference frame for broadcast orbits on January 29, 1997.
WGS 84 is the default standard datum for coordinates stored in recreational and commercial GPS units.
For example, the longitudinal difference between a point on the equator in Uganda, on the African Plate, and a point on the equator in Ecuador, on the South American Plate, increases by about 0.0014 arcseconds per year.
Most mapping, such as within a single country, does not span plates.
Ptolemy credited him with the full adoption of longitude and latitude, rather than measuring latitude in terms of the length of the midsummer day.
Mathematical cartography resumed in Europe following Maximus Planudes' recovery of Ptolemy's text a little before 1300; the text was translated into Latin at Florence by Jacobus Angelus around 1407.
They then choose the most appropriate mapping of the spherical coordinate system onto that ellipsoid, called a terrestrial reference system or geodetic datum.
φ, or phi) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and the straight line that passes through that point and through (or close to) the center of the Earth.
All meridians are halves of great ellipses (often called great circles), which converge at the North and South Poles.
The antipodal meridian of Greenwich is both 180°W and 180°E. This is not to be conflated with the International Date Line, which diverges from it in several places for political and convenience reasons, including between far eastern Russia and the far western Aleutian Islands.
Coordinates on a map are usually in terms northing N and easting E offsets relative to a specified origin.
In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north–south position of a point on the Earth's surface.
Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth.
The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface.
Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface.
Since there are many different reference ellipsoids, the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique: this is stressed in the ISO standard which states that "without the full specification of the coordinate reference system, coordinates (that is latitude and longitude) are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst".
The plane through the centre of the Earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the Equator.
The time variation is discussed more fully in the article on axial tilt.
The situation is reversed at the June solstice, when the Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer.
Since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid, the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid: one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used.
Geographic latitude must be used with care.
The evaluation of the meridian distance integral is central to many studies in geodesy and map projection.
There are two methods of proceeding.
When converting from isometric or conformal to geodetic, two iterations of Newton-Raphson gives double precision accuracy.
The differences shown on the plot are in arc minutes.
The transformation between geodetic and Cartesian coordinates may be found in Geographic coordinate conversion.
In general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid.
Longitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the east–west position of a point on the Earth's surface, or the surface of a celestial body.
The prime meridian, which passes near the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England, is defined as 0° longitude by convention.
Local time (for example from the position of the sun) varies with longitude, a difference of 15° longitude corresponding to a one-hour difference in local time.
The principle is straightforward, but in practice finding a reliable method of determining longitude took centuries and required the effort of some of the greatest scientific minds.
His prime meridian passed through Alexandria.
In 1910, the Journal published an article by Ulysses G. Weatherly (1865-1940) that called for white supremacy and segregation of the races to protect racial purity.
In his work, he contended that social class, colonialism, and capitalism shaped ideas about race and racial categories.
By 1978, William Julius Wilson (1935–) argued that race and racial classification systems were declining in significance, and that instead, social class more accurately described what sociologists had earlier understood as race.
Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, Sociology professor at Duke University, remarks, "I contend that racism is, more than anything else, a matter of group power; it is about a dominant racial group (whites) striving to maintain its systemic advantages and minorities fighting to subvert the racial status quo.
In clinical settings, race has sometimes been considered in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions.
There is an active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of race in their research.
Members of the latter camp often base their arguments around the potential to create genome-based personalized medicine.
They argue that overemphasizing genetic contributions to health disparities carries various risks such as reinforcing stereotypes, promoting racism or ignoring the contribution of non-genetic factors to health disparities.
IC" stands for "Identification Code;" these items are also referred to as Phoenix classifications.
In many countries, such as France, the state is legally banned from maintaining data based on race, which often makes the police issue wanted notices to the public that include labels like "dark skin complexion", etc.
Many consider de facto racial profiling an example of institutional racism in law enforcement.
Mass incarceration is also, "the larger web of laws, rules, policies, and customs that control those labeled criminals both in and out of prison."
Many research findings appear to agree that the impact of victim race in the IPV arrest decision might possibly include a racial bias in favor of white victims.
Some studies have reported that races can be identified with a high degree of accuracy using certain methods, such as that developed by Giles and Elliot.
The study concluded that "The apportionment of genetic diversity in skin color is atypical, and cannot be used for purposes of classification."
Cultural anthropology is a branch of anthropology focused on the study of cultural variation among humans.
In addressing this question, ethnologists in the 19th century divided into two schools of thought.
Some of those who advocated "independent invention", like Lewis Henry Morgan, additionally supposed that similarities meant that different groups had passed through the same stages of cultural evolution (See also classical social evolutionism).
Morgan, like other 19th century social evolutionists, believed there was a more or less orderly progression from the primitive to the civilized.
Although 19th-century ethnologists saw "diffusion" and "independent invention" as mutually exclusive and competing theories, most ethnographers quickly reached a consensus that both processes occur, and that both can plausibly account for cross-cultural similarities.
Boas first articulated the idea in 1887: "...civilization is not something absolute, but ... is relative, and ... our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes."
Cultural relativism involves specific epistemological and methodological claims.
Cultural relativism was in part a response to Western ethnocentrism.
This understanding of culture confronts anthropologists with two problems: first, how to escape the unconscious bonds of one's own culture, which inevitably bias our perceptions of and reactions to the world, and second, how to make sense of an unfamiliar culture.
One such method is that of ethnography: basically, they advocated living with people of another culture for an extended period of time, so that they could learn the local language and be enculturated, at least partially, into that culture.
His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws.
An example of multi-sited ethnography is Nancy Scheper-Hughes' work on the international black market for the trade of human organs.

Third, group formation resulted from the drive to monopolize power and status.
Barth went further than Weber in stressing the constructed nature of ethnicity.
He wanted to part with anthropological notions of cultures as bounded entities, and ethnicity as primordialist bonds, replacing it with a focus on the interface between groups.
He agrees with Joan Vincent's observation that (in Cohen's paraphrase) "Ethnicity... can be narrowed or broadened in boundary terms in relation to the specific needs of political mobilization.
Ethnic groups came to be defined as social rather than biological entities.
Examples of various approaches are primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism, and instrumentalism.
"Essentialist primordialism" further holds that ethnicity is an a priori fact of human existence, that ethnicity precedes any human social interaction and that it is unchanged by it.
"Kinship primordialism" holds that ethnic communities are extensions of kinship units, basically being derived by kinship or clan ties where the choices of cultural signs (language, religion, traditions) are made exactly to show this biological affinity.
"Geertz's primordialism", notably espoused by anthropologist Clifford Geertz, argues that humans in general attribute an overwhelming power to primordial human "givens" such as blood ties, language, territory, and cultural differences.
Smith (1999) distinguishes two variants: "continuous perennialism", which claims that particular nations have existed for very long periods, and "recurrent perennialism", which focuses on the emergence, dissolution and reappearance of nations as a recurring aspect of human history.
This view holds that the concept of ethnicity is a tool used by political groups to manipulate resources such as wealth, power, territory or status in their particular groups' interests.
"Instrumentalist perennialism", while seeing ethnicity primarily as a versatile tool that identified different ethnics groups and limits through time, explains ethnicity as a mechanism of social stratification, meaning that ethnicity is the basis for a hierarchical arrangement of individuals.
According to Donald Noel, ethnic stratification will emerge only when specific ethnic groups are brought into contact with one another, and only when those groups are characterized by a high degree of ethnocentrism, competition, and differential power.
Continuing with Noel's theory, some degree of differential power must be present for the emergence of ethnic stratification.
The different ethnic groups must be competing for some common goal, such as power or influence, or a material interest, such as wealth or territory.
It holds that ethnic groups are only products of human social interaction, maintained only in so far as they are maintained as valid social constructs in societies.
They hold that prior to this ethnic homogeneity was not considered an ideal or necessary factor in the forging of large-scale societies.

Available names are those published in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and not otherwise suppressed by subsequent decisions of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN); the earliest such name for any taxon (for example, a genus) should then be selected as the "valid" (i.e., current or accepted) name for the taxon in question.
In botany, similar concepts exist but with different labels.
However, many names have been assigned (usually unintentionally) to two or more different genera.
A name that means two different things is a homonym.

In order to address some of these concerns some GMOs have been developed with traits to help control their spread.
Other environmental and agronomic concerns include a decrease in biodiversity, an increase in secondary pests (non-targeted pests) and evolution of resistant insect pests.
The impact of Bt crops on beneficial non-target organisms became a public issue after a 1999 paper suggested they could be toxic to monarch butterflies.
With the ability to genetically engineer humans now possible there are ethical concerns over how far this technology should go, or if it should be used at all.
October 2006 the rigor of the regulatory process, consolidation of control of the food supply in companies that make and sell GMOs, exaggeration of the benefits of genetic modification, or concerns over the use of herbicides with glyphosate.
GMOs arrived on the scene as the public confidence in food safety, attributed to recent food scares such as Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and other scandals involving government regulation of products in Europe, was low.
Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification or genetic manipulation, is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology.
A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism.
The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or targeted to a specific part of the genome.
Rudolf Jaenisch created the first GM animal when he inserted foreign DNA into a mouse in 1974.
Genetically modified food has been sold since 1994, with the release of the Flavr Savr tomato.
In 2016 salmon modified with a growth hormone were sold.
By knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create animal model organisms of human diseases.
The rise of commercialised genetically modified crops has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries, but has also been the source of most of the controversy surrounding the technology.
Gene flow, impact on non-target organisms, control of the food supply and intellectual property rights have also been raised as potential issues.
This is much faster, can be used to insert any genes from any organism (even ones from different domains) and prevents other undesirable genes from also being added.
Drugs, vaccines and other products have been harvested from organisms engineered to produce them.
Synthetic biology is an emerging discipline that takes genetic engineering a step further by introducing artificially synthesised material into an organism.
If genetic material from another species is added to the host, the resulting organism is called transgenic.

In particular, mathēmatikḗ tékhnē meant "the mathematical art."
In English, the noun mathematics takes a singular verb.
However, Aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, abstraction and studying quantity as a property "separable in thought" from real instances set mathematics apart.
A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions.
Haskell Curry defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".
Popper also noted that "I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience."
Intuition and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences.
For example, the physicist Richard Feynman invented the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's string theory, a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four fundamental forces of nature, continues to inspire new mathematics.
A distinction is often made between pure mathematics and applied mathematics.
As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest Mathematics Subject Classification runs to 46 pages.
Many mathematicians talk about the elegance of mathematics, its intrinsic aesthetics and inner beauty.
G. H. Hardy in A Mathematician's Apology expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics.
A theorem expressed as a characterization of the object by these features is the prize.
Euler (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today.
Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as cow) with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.
Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as homeomorphism and integrable that have no meaning outside of mathematics.
Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".
This is to avoid mistaken "theorems", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.
The players take turns removing m multiples of the smaller pile from the larger.
By allowing u to vary over all possible integers, an infinite family of solutions can be generated from a single solution (x1, y1).
In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12.
Now assume that the result holds for all values of N up to M − 1.
For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively.
One inefficient approach to finding the GCD of two natural numbers a and b is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor.
As noted above, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a and b. Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.
Lehmer's GCD algorithm uses the same general principle as the binary algorithm to speed up GCD computations in arbitrary bases.
The Euclidean algorithm can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for polynomials; continued fractions of polynomials can also be defined.
Any Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain (UFD), although the converse is not true.
A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain (PID), an integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal.
Numerators and denominators are also used in fractions that are not common, including compound fractions, complex fractions, and mixed numerals.
The term was originally used to distinguish this type of fraction from the sexagesimal fraction used in astronomy.
This was explained in the 17th century textbook The Ground of Arts.
The product of a fraction and its reciprocal is 1, hence the reciprocal is the multiplicative inverse of a fraction.
The remainder becomes the numerator of the fractional part.
Since 5×17 (= 85) is greater than 4×18 (= 72), the result of comparing is .
Since one third of a quarter is one twelfth, two thirds of a quarter is two twelfth.
Sometimes an infinite repeating decimal is required to reach the same precision.
The Egyptians used Egyptian fractions BC.
Their methods gave the same answer as modern methods.
A modern expression of fractions known as bhinnarasi seems to have originated in India in the work of Aryabhatta, Brahmagupta, and Bhaskara.
In mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value, called the modulus.
A very practical application is to calculate checksums within serial number identifiers.
RSA and Diffie–Hellman use modular exponentiation.
It is used by the most efficient implementations of polynomial greatest common divisor, exact linear algebra and Gröbner basis algorithms over the integers and the rational numbers.
The modulo operation, as implemented in many programming languages and calculators, is an application of modular arithmetic that is often used in this context.
The method of casting out nines offers a quick check of decimal arithmetic computations performed by hand.
A linear system of congruences can be solved in polynomial time with a form of Gaussian elimination, for details see linear congruence theorem.
The multiplication of integers (including negative numbers), rational numbers (fractions) and real numbers is defined by a systematic generalization of this basic definition.
The product of two measurements is a new type of measurement.
The inverse operation of multiplication is division.
The division of a number other than 0 by itself equals 1.
This implicit usage of multiplication can cause ambiguity when the concatenated variables happen to match the name of another variable, when a variable name in front of a parenthesis can be confused with a function name, or in the correct determination of the order of operations.
The numbers to be multiplied are generally called the "factors".
Also as the result of a multiplication does not depend on the order of the factors, the distinction between "multiplicand" and "multiplier" is useful only at a very elementary level and in some multiplication algorithms, such as the long multiplication.
The result of a multiplication is called a product.
The slide rule allowed numbers to be quickly multiplied to about three places of accuracy.
The general theory is given by dimensional analysis.
The complex numbers do not have an ordering.
Here we have identity 1, as opposed to groups under addition where the identity is typically 0.
To see this, consider the set of invertible square matrices of a given dimension over a given field.
Another fact worth noticing is that the integers under multiplication is not a group—even if we exclude zero.
In mathematics, a percentage (from Latin per centum "by a hundred") is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100.
Computation with these fractions was equivalent to computing percentages.
Whenever communicating about a percentage, it is important to specify what it is relative to (i.e., what is the total that corresponds to 100%).
When speaking of a "10% rise" or a "10% fall" in a quantity, the usual interpretation is that this is relative to the initial value of that quantity.
The same confusion between the different concepts of percent(age) and percentage points can potentially cause a major misunderstanding when journalists report about election results, for example, expressing both new results and differences with earlier results as percentages.
The term has been attributed to Latin per centum.
Grammar and style guides often differ as to how percentages are to be written.
When interest rates are very low, the number 0 is included if the interest rate is less than 1%, e.g. "% Treasury Stock", not "% Treasury Stock".)
Likewise, the winning percentage of a team, the fraction of matches that the club has won, is also usually expressed as a decimal proportion; a team that has a .500 winning percentage has won 50% of their matches.
Subtraction also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations, such as addition and multiplication.
Performing subtraction on natural numbers is one of the simplest numerical tasks.
Formally, the number being subtracted is known as the subtrahend, while the number it is subtracted from is the minuend.
Subtraction" is an English word derived from the Latin verb subtrahere, which in turn is a compound of sub "from under" and trahere "to pull".
From position 3, it takes no steps to the left to stay at 3, so .
To represent such an operation, the line must be extended.
The leading digit "1" of the result is then discarded.
In the ten's place, 0 is less than 1, so the 0 is increased by 10, and the difference with 1, which is 9, is written down in the ten's place.
The subtraction then proceeds in the hundreds place, where 6 is not less than 5, so the difference is written down in the result's hundred's place.
Rather it increases the subtrahend hundred's digit by one.
The answer is 1, and is written down in the result's hundred's place.
This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica, where he claimed that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin.
The five color theorem, which has a short elementary proof, states that five colors suffice to color a map and was proven in the late 19th century; however, proving that four colors suffice turned out to be significantly harder.
It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer.
Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps.
It was originally formulated in 1908, by Steinitz and Tietze.
A variety V over a finite field with q elements has a finite number of rational points, as well as points over every finite field with qk elements containing that field.
Originally conjectured by Henri Poincaré, the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a closed 3-manifold).
After nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, Grigori Perelman presented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 on arXiv.
Perelman completed this portion of the proof.
Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is widely conjectured that the answer is no.
It has not been proven which one is false, but it is widely believed that the first conjecture is true and the second one is false.
For instance, the Collatz conjecture, which concerns whether or not certain sequences of integers terminate, has been tested for all integers up to 1.2 × 1012 (over a trillion).
That evidence may be of various kinds, such as verification of consequences of it or strong interconnections with known results.
One method of proof, applicable when there are only a finite number of cases that could lead to counterexamples, is known as "brute force": in this approach, all possible cases are considered and shown not to give counterexamples.
The continuum hypothesis, which tries to ascertain the relative cardinality of certain infinite sets, was eventually shown to be independent from the generally accepted set of Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms of set theory.
Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true.
The logistic map is a polynomial mapping, often cited as an archetypal example of how chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations.
Kepler proved that it is the limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
For two reasons this representation may cause problems.
For example, the two representations 0.999... and 1 are equivalent in the sense that they represent the same number.
Using computers and supercomputers, some of the mathematical constants, including π, e, and the square root of 2, have been computed to more than one hundred billion digits.
Some constants differ so much from the usual kind that a new notation has been invented to represent them reasonably.
Sometimes, the symbol representing a constant is a whole word.
0 (zero) is a number, and the numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals.
Names for the number 0 in English include zero, nought (UK), naught (US; ), nil, or—in contexts where at least one adjacent digit distinguishes it from the letter "O"—oh or o.
For the simple notion of lacking, the words nothing and none are often used.
It is often called oh in the context of telephone numbers.
The symbol nfr, meaning beautiful, was also used to indicate the base level in drawings of tombs and pyramids, and distances were measured relative to the base line as being above or below this line.
The Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone, nor was it used at the end of a number.
By AD 150, Ptolemy, influenced by Hipparchus and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for zero in his work on mathematical astronomy called the Syntaxis Mathematica, also known as the Almagest.
This use was repeated in AD525 in an equivalent table, that was translated via the Latin nulla or "none" by Dionysius Exiguus, alongside Roman numerals.
The Lokavibhāga, a Jain text on cosmology surviving in a medieval Sanskrit translation of the Prakrit original, which is internally dated to AD 458 (Saka era 380), uses a decimal place-value system, including a zero.
In 813, al-Khwarizmi used the Hindu numerals in his astronomical tables."

I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters.
The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1.
254–255 include 0 as a natural number, in which case it is the only natural number that is not positive.
As a value or a number, zero is not the same as the digit zero, used in numeral systems with positional notation.
The number 0 may or may not be considered a natural number, but it is an integer, and hence a rational number and a real number (as well as an algebraic number and a complex number).
It cannot be prime because it has an infinite number of factors, and cannot be composite because it cannot be expressed as a product of prime numbers (as 0 must always be one of the factors).
These rules apply for any real or complex number x, unless otherwise stated.
The cardinality function, applied to the empty set, returns the empty set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements.
In abstract algebra, 0 is commonly used to denote a zero element, which is a neutral element for addition (if defined on the structure under consideration) and an absorbing element for multiplication (if defined).
For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished from all other levels, whereas for others it is more or less arbitrarily chosen.
It has been shown that a cluster of four neutrons may be stable enough to be considered an atom in its own right.
For example, the elements of an array are numbered starting from 0 in C, so that for an array of n items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to .
In databases, it is possible for a field not to have a value.
For text fields this is not blank nor the empty string.
Any computation including a null value delivers a null result.
In Formula One, if the reigning World Champion no longer competes in Formula One in the year following their victory in the title race, 0 is given to one of the drivers of the team that the reigning champion won the title with.
Typewriters originally made no distinction in shape between O and 0; some models did not even have a separate key for the digit 0.
The digit 0 with a dot in the center seems to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 displays and has continued with some modern computer typefaces such as Andalé Mono, and in some airline reservation systems.
1 (one, also called unit, and unity) is a number and a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals.
In conventions of sign where zero is considered neither positive nor negative, 1 is the first and smallest positive integer.
Most if not all properties of 1 can be deduced from this.
It is thus the integer after zero.
It was transmitted to Europe via the Maghreb and Andalusia during the Middle Ages, through scholarly works written in Arabic.
Styles that do not use the long upstroke on digit 1 usually do not use the horizontal stroke through the vertical of the digit 7 either.
By definition, 1 is the magnitude, absolute value, or norm of a unit complex number, unit vector, and a unit matrix (more usually called an identity matrix).
In category theory, 1 is sometimes used to denote the terminal object of a category.
Since the base 1 exponential function (1x) always equals 1, its inverse does not exist (which would be called the logarithm base 1 if it did exist).
Likewise, vectors are often normalized into unit vectors (i.e., vectors of magnitude one), because these often have more desirable properties.
It is also the first and second number in the Fibonacci sequence (0 being the zeroth) and is the first number in many other mathematical sequences.
Nevertheless, abstract algebra can consider the field with one element, which is not a singleton and is not a set at all.
A binary code is a sequence of 1 and 0 that is used in computers for representing any kind of data.
+1 is the electric charge of positrons and protons.

In association football (soccer) the number 1 is often given to the goalkeeper.
1 is the lowest number permitted for use by players of the National Hockey League (NHL); the league prohibited the use of 00 and 0 in the late 1990s (the highest number permitted being 98).
Any random sequence of digits contains arbitrarily long subsequences that appear non-random, by the infinite monkey theorem.
Second, since no transcendental number can be constructed with compass and straightedge, it is not possible to "square the circle".
The Indian astronomer Aryabhata used a value of 3.1416 in his Āryabhaṭīya (499 AD).
The Persian astronomer Jamshīd al-Kāshī produced 9 sexagesimal digits, roughly the equivalent of 16 decimal digits, in 1424 using a polygon with 3×228 sides, which stood as the world record for about 180 years.
These avoid reliance on infinite series.
As modified by Salamin and Brent, it is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm.
This is in contrast to infinite series or iterative algorithms, which retain and use all intermediate digits until the final result is produced.
Such memorization aids are called mnemonics.
The digits are large wooden characters attached to the dome-like ceiling.
A numerical digit is a single symbol used alone (such as "2") or in combinations (such as "25"), to represent numbers in a positional numeral system.
A positional number system has one unique digit for each integer from zero up to, but not including, the radix of the number system.
The original numerals were very similar to the modern ones, even down to the glyphs used to represent digits.
The Mayas used a shell symbol to represent zero.
The Thai numeral system is identical to the Hindu–Arabic numeral system except for the symbols used to represent digits.
They are both base 3 systems.
Several authors in the last 300 years have noted a facility of positional notation that amounts to a modified decimal representation.
For example, 1111 (one thousand, one hundred and eleven) is a repunit.
Besides counting ten fingers, some cultures have counted knuckles, the space between fingers, and toes as well as fingers.
Stone age cultures, including ancient indigenous American groups, used tallies for gambling, personal services, and trade-goods.
Beginning about 3500 BC, clay tokens were gradually replaced by number signs impressed with a round stylus at different angles in clay tablets (originally containers for tokens) which were then baked.
These cuneiform number signs resembled the round number signs they replaced and retained the additive sign-value notation of the round number signs.
Sexagesimal numerals were a mixed radix system that retained the alternating base 10 and base 6 in a sequence of cuneiform vertical wedges and chevrons.

Zero was first used in India in the 7th century CE by Brahmagupta.
Arabic mathematicians extended the system to include decimal fractions, and Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Ḵwārizmī wrote an important work about it in the 9th century.
The binary system (base 2), was propagated in the 17th century by Gottfried Leibniz.
The variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called unknowns, and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation.
A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables.
Very often the right-hand side of an equation is assumed to be zero.
An equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed.
This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry, an important area of mathematics.
To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis.
These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.
In the illustration, x, y and z are all different quantities (in this case real numbers) represented as circular weights, and each of x, y, and z has a different weight.
Hence, the equation with R unspecified is the general equation for the circle.
The process of finding the solutions, or, in case of parameters, expressing the unknowns in terms of the parameters, is called solving the equation.
Multiplying or dividing both sides of an equation by a non-zero quantity.
An algebraic equation is univariate if it involves only one variable.
In mathematics, the theory of linear systems is the basis and a fundamental part of linear algebra, a subject which is used in most parts of modern mathematics.
This formalism allows one to determine the positions and the properties of the focuses of a conic.
This point of view, outlined by Descartes, enriches and modifies the type of geometry conceived of by the ancient Greek mathematicians.
An exponential Diophantine equation is one for which exponents of the terms of the equation can be unknowns.
Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of abstract algebra, especially commutative algebra, with the language and the problems of geometry.
A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation.
In pure mathematics, differential equations are studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions — the set of functions that satisfy the equation.
Linear differential equations, which have solutions that can be added and multiplied by coefficients, are well-defined and understood, and exact closed-form solutions are obtained.
PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as sound, heat, electrostatics, electrodynamics, fluid flow, elasticity, or quantum mechanics.
A solution is an assignment of values to the unknown variables that makes the equality in the equation true.
The set of all solutions of an equation is its solution set.
Depending on the context, solving an equation may consist to find either any solution (finding a single solution is enough), all solutions, or a solution that satisfies further properties, such as belonging to a given interval.
In this case, the solutions cannot be listed.
The variety in types of equations is large, and so are the corresponding methods.
This may be due to a lack of mathematical knowledge; some problems were only solved after centuries of effort.
Polynomials appear in many areas of mathematics and science.
Many authors use these two words interchangeably.
Formally, the name of the polynomial is P, not P(x), but the use of the functional notation P(x) dates from a time when the distinction between a polynomial and the associated function was unclear.
However, one may use it over any domain where addition and multiplication are defined (that is, any ring).
Polynomials of small degree have been given specific names.
The polynomial 0, which may be considered to have no terms at all, is called the zero polynomial.
Because the degree of a non-zero polynomial is the largest degree of any one term, this polynomial has degree two.
Polynomials can be classified by the number of terms with nonzero coefficients, so that a one-term polynomial is called a monomial, a two-term polynomial is called a binomial, and a three-term polynomial is called a trinomial.
When it is used to define a function, the domain is not so restricted.
A polynomial in one indeterminate is called a univariate polynomial, a polynomial in more than one indeterminate is called a multivariate polynomial.
In the case of the field of complex numbers, the irreducible factors are linear.
If the degree is higher than one, the graph does not have any asymptote.
In elementary algebra, methods such as the quadratic formula are taught for solving all first degree and second degree polynomial equations in one variable.
However, root-finding algorithms may be used to find numerical approximations of the roots of a polynomial expression of any degree.
Since the 16th century, similar formulas (using cube roots in addition to square roots), but much more complicated are known for equations of degree three and four (see cubic equation and quartic equation).
In 1830, Évariste Galois proved that most equations of degree higher than four cannot be solved by radicals, and showed that for each equation, one may decide whether it is solvable by radicals, and, if it is, solve it.
Nevertheless, formulas for solvable equations of degrees 5 and 6 have been published (see quintic function and sextic equation).
The most efficient algorithms allow solving easily (on a computer) polynomial equations of degree higher than 1,000 (see Root-finding algorithm).
For a set of polynomial equations in several unknowns, there are algorithms to decide whether they have a finite number of complex solutions, and, if this number is finite, for computing the solutions.
A polynomial equation for which one is interested only in the solutions which are integers is called a Diophantine equation.
The coefficients may be taken as real numbers, for real-valued functions.
This equivalence explains why linear combinations are called polynomials.
In the case of coefficients in a ring, "non-constant" must be replaced by "non-constant or non-unit" (both definitions agree in the case of coefficients in a field).
When the coefficients belong to integers, rational numbers or a finite field, there are algorithms to test irreducibility and to compute the factorization into irreducible polynomials (see Factorization of polynomials).
The characteristic polynomial of a matrix or linear operator contains information about the operator's eigenvalues.
However, the elegant and practical notation we use today only developed beginning in the 15th century.
This "completes the square", converting the left side into a perfect square.
Descartes' theorem states that for every four kissing (mutually tangent) circles, their radii satisfy a particular quadratic equation.
Babylonian mathematicians from circa 400 BC and Chinese mathematicians from circa 200 BC used geometric methods of dissection to solve quadratic equations with positive roots.
Euclid, the Greek mathematician, produced a more abstract geometrical method around 300 BC.
Al-Khwarizmi goes further in providing a full solution to the general quadratic equation, accepting one or two numerical answers for every quadratic equation, while providing geometric proofs in the process.
Abū Kāmil Shujā ibn Aslam (Egypt, 10th century) in particular was the first to accept irrational numbers (often in the form of a square root, cube root or fourth root) as solutions to quadratic equations or as coefficients in an equation.
He used a prime meridian through the Canary Islands, so that all longitude values would be positive.
Hindu and Muslim astronomers continued to develop these ideas, adding many new locations and often improving on Ptolemy's data.
In the later Middle Ages, interest in geography revived in the west, as travel increased, and Arab scholarship began to be known through contact with Spain and North Africa.
Christopher Columbus made two attempts to use lunar eclipses to discover his longitude, the first in Saona Island, on 14 September 1494 (second voyage), and the second in Jamaica on 29 February 1504 (fourth voyage).
Initially an observation device, developments over the next half century transformed it into an accurate measurement tool.
On land, the period from the development of telescopes and pendulum clocks until the mid 18th-Century saw a steady increase in the number of places whose longitude had been determined with reasonable accuracy, often with errors of less than a degree, and nearly always within 2-3°.
Making accurate observations in an ocean swell is much harder than on land, and pendulum clocks do not work well in these conditions.
It offered two levels of rewards, for solutions within 1° and 0.5°.
This work was supported and rewarded with thousands of pounds from the Board of Longitude, but he fought to receive money up to the top reward of £20,000, finally receiving an additional payment in 1773 after the intervention of parliament.
Lunar distances came into general use after 1790.
It was quickly realised that the telegraph could be used to transmit a time signal for longitude determination.
The Survey established chains of mapped locations through Central and South America, and the West Indies, and as far as Japan and China in the years 1874–90.
This changed when wireless telegraphy became available in the early 20th-Century.
Radio navigation systems came into general use after World War II.
With the exception of magnetic declination, all proved practicable methods.
Longitude at a point may be determined by calculating the time difference between that at its location and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
The word near is used because the point might not be at the centre of the time zone; also the time zones are defined politically, so their centres and boundaries often do not lie on meridians at multiples of 15°.
The international standard convention (ISO 6709)—that East is positive—is consistent with a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, with the North Pole up.
They have since shifted to the standard approach.
The geoid is the shape that the ocean surface would take under the influence of the gravity of Earth, including gravitational attraction and Earth's rotation, if other influences such as winds and tides were absent.
It can be known only through extensive gravitational measurements and calculations.
Although the physical Earth has excursions of +8,848 m (Mount Everest) and −10,984 (Marianas Trench), the geoid's deviation from an ellipsoid ranges from +85 m (Iceland) to −106 m (southern India), less than 200 m total.
If the continental land masses were crisscrossed by a series of tunnels or canals, the sea level in those canals would also very nearly coincide with the geoid.
That means that when traveling by ship, one does not notice the undulations of the geoid; the local vertical (plumb line) is always perpendicular to the geoid and the local horizon tangential to it.
That is because GPS satellites, orbiting about the center of gravity of the Earth, can measure heights only relative to a geocentric reference ellipsoid.
Modern GPS receivers have a grid implemented in their software by which they obtain, from the current position, the height of the geoid (e.g. the EGM-96 geoid) over the World Geodetic System (WGS) ellipsoid.
If that sphere were then covered in water, the water would not be the same height everywhere.
This is why many handheld GPS receivers have built-in undulation lookup tables to determine the height above sea level.
The first products based on GOCE satellite data became available online in June 2010, through the European Space Agency (ESA)’s Earth observation user services tools.
The geoid is a particular equipotential surface, and is somewhat involved to compute.
A globe is a spherical model of Earth, of some other celestial body, or of the celestial sphere.
A model globe of the celestial sphere is called a celestial globe.
It might show nations and major cities and the network of latitude and longitude lines.
Typically, it will also divide the celestial sphere into constellations.
The first known mention of a globe is from Strabo, describing the Globe of Crates from about 150 BC.
Many globes are made with a circumference of one metre, so they are models of the Earth at a scale of 1:40 million.
Most modern globes are also imprinted with parallels and meridians, so that one can tell the approximate coordinates of a specific location.
Early terrestrial globes depicting the entirety of the Old World were constructed in the Islamic world.
Behaim was a German mapmaker, navigator, and merchant.
Before constructing the globe, Behaim had traveled extensively.
Another early globe, the Hunt–Lenox Globe, ca.
It may be the oldest globe to show the New World.
A facsimile globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemueller in 1507.
Globus IMP, electro-mechanical devices including five-inch globes have been used in Soviet and Russian spacecraft from 1961 to 2002 as navigation instruments.
This method of globe making was illustrated in 1802 in an engraving in The English Encyclopedia by George Kearsley .
This is placed in a machine which molds the disk into a hemispherical shape.
These globes were “enormous” and very costly.
The latter has a Soviet bullet hole through Germany.
A great circle, also known as an orthodrome, of a sphere is the intersection of the sphere and a plane that passes through the center point of the sphere.
This special case of a circle of a sphere is in opposition to a small circle, that is, the intersection of the sphere and a plane that does not pass through the center.
The exception is a pair of antipodal points, for which there are infinitely many great circles.
The length of the minor arc of a great circle is taken as the distance between two points on a surface of a sphere in Riemannian geometry where such great circles are called Riemannian circles.
Another great circle is the one that divides the land and water hemispheres.
Where the light source emanates along the line described in this last constraint is what yields the differences between the various "natural" cylindrical projections.
North-south distances neither stretched nor compressed (1): equirectangular projection or "plate carrée".
Can be constructed from a point of perspective an infinite distance from the tangent point; r(d) = c sin .
Mercator titled the map : "A new and augmented description of Earth corrected for the use of sailors".
A World Map on a Regular Icosahedron by Gnomonic Projection."
The range for a amongst the possible choices is about 35 km, but for small scale (large region) applications this variation may be ignored, and mean values of 6,371 km and 40,030 km may be taken for the radius and circumference respectively.
A cylindrical map projection is specified by formulae linking the geographic coordinates of latitude φ and longitude λ to Cartesian coordinates on the map with origin on the equator and x-axis along the equator.
The difference (λ − λ0) is in radians.
Narrower strips are better: sec 8° = 1.01, so a strip of width 16° (centred on the equator) is accurate to within 1% or 1 part in 100.
The value of e2 is about 0.006 for all reference ellipsoids.)
For the above model 1 cm corresponds to 1,500 km at a latitude of 60°.
This chord subtends an angle at the centre equal to 2arcsin(cos φ sin ) and the great circle distance between A and B is 2a arcsin(cos φ sin ).)
For other bodies a fixed surface feature is usually referenced, which for Mars is the meridian passing through the crater Airy-0.
By convention for the Earth, Moon, and Sun it is expressed in degrees ranging from −180° to +180° For other bodies a range of 0° to 360° is used.
The scale of a map is the ratio of a distance on the map to the corresponding distance on the ground.
The first way is the ratio of the size of the generating globe to the size of the Earth.
Many maps state the nominal scale and may even display a bar scale (sometimes merely called a 'scale') to represent it.
In this case 'scale' means the scale factor (= point scale = particular scale).
The map projection becomes critical in understanding how scale varies throughout the map.
This is a survey of virtually all known projections from antiquity to 1993.
Small scale refers to world maps or maps of large regions such as continents or large nations.
Large-scale maps show smaller areas in more detail, such as county maps or town plans might.
However, as explained above, cartographers use the term "large scale" to refer to less extensive maps – those that show a smaller area.
This is commonly illustrated by the impossibility of smoothing an orange peel onto a flat surface without tearing and deforming it.
Conversely isotropic scale factors across the map imply a conformal projection.
The qualification 'small' means that at some given accuracy of measurement no change can be detected in the scale factor over the element.
We say that these coordinates define the projection map which must be distinguished logically from the actual printed (or viewed) maps.
Since the point scale varies with position and direction the projection of the circle on the projection will be distorted.
Superimposing these distortion ellipses on the map projection conveys the way in which the point scale is changing over the map.
The ratio of the major axis to the minor axis is .
The scale is true (k=1) on the equator so that multiplying its length on a printed map by the inverse of the RF (or principal scale) gives the actual circumference of the Earth.
The top plot shows the isotropic Mercator scale function: the scale on the parallel is the same as the scale on the meridian.
Therefore, the tangent Mercator projection is highly accurate within a strip of width 3.24 degrees centred on the equator.
These observations prompted the development of the transverse Mercator projections in which a meridian is treated 'like an equator' of the projection so that we obtain an accurate map within a narrow distance of that meridian.
The four cardinal directions, or cardinal points, are the four main compass directions: north, east, south, and west, commonly denoted by their initials N, E, S, and W respectively.
When travelling East or West, it is only on the Equator that one can keep East or West and be going straight (without the need to steer).
The north pole of the magnetic needle points towards the geographic north pole of the earth and vice versa.
In the middle of the day, it is to the south for viewers in the Northern Hemisphere, who live north of the Tropic of Cancer, and the north for those in the Southern Hemisphere, who live south of the Tropic of Capricorn.
In these locations, one needs first to determine whether the sun is moving from east to west through north or south by watching its movements—left to right means it is going through south while the right to left means it is going through north; or one can watch the sun's shadows.
Because of the Earth's axial tilt, no matter what the location of the viewer, there are only two days each year when the sun rises precisely due east.
For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north.
This axis intersects the Celestial Sphere at the North and South Celestial poles, which appear to the observer to lie directly above due North and South respectively on the horizon.
The resulting photograph reveals a multitude of concentric arcs (portions of perfect circles) from which the exact center can be readily derived, and which corresponds to the Celestial pole, which lies directly above the position of the true pole (North or South) on the horizon.
The exact position of the pole changes over thousands of years because of the precession of the equinoxes.
The asterism "Big Dipper" may be used to find Polaris.
Since it finds true, rather than magnetic, north, it is immune to interference by local or shipboard magnetic fields.
Most maps in medieval Europe, for example, placed east (E) at the top.
Topographic maps include elevation, typically via contour lines.
The North point will then be the point on the limb that is closest to the North celestial pole.
Going around the disk clockwise from the North point, one encounters in order the West point, the South point, and then the East point.
In pre-modern Europe more generally, between eight and 32 points of the compass – cardinal and intercardinal directions – were given names.
Systems with five cardinal points (four directions and the center) include those from pre-modern China, as well as traditional Turkic, Tibetan and Ainu cultures.
Some may also include "above" and "below" as directions, and therefore focus on a cosmology of seven directions.
North is associated with the Himalayas and heaven while the south is associated with the underworld or land of the fathers (Pitr loka).
North is one of the four compass points or cardinal directions.
Septentrionalis is from septentriones, "the seven plow oxen", a name of Ursa Major.
For example, in Lezgian, kefer can mean both "disbelief" and "north", since to the north of the Muslim Lezgian homeland there are areas formerly inhabited by non-Muslim Caucasian and Turkic peoples.
On any rotating astronomical object, north often denotes the side appearing to rotate counter-clockwise when viewed from afar along the axis of rotation.
But simple generalizations on the subject should be treated as unsound, and as likely to reflect popular misconceptions about terrestrial magnetism.
This convention has developed from the use of a compass, which places north at the top.
95% of the Global North has enough food and shelter, and a functioning education system.
Use of the term "South" may also be country-relative, particularly in cases of noticeable economic or cultural divide.
Rarely does the meaning broaden to Bolivia, and in the most restricted sense it only covers Chile, Argentina and Uruguay.
West is the direction opposite that of the Earth's rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the Sun appears to constantly progress and eventually set.
In Ancient Egypt, the West was considered to be the portal to the netherworld, and is the cardinal direction regarded in connection with death, though not always with a negative connotation.
In Judaism, west is seen to be toward the Shekinah (presence) of God, as in Jewish history the Tabernacle and subsequent Jerusalem Temple faced east, with God's Presence in the Holy of Holies up the steps to the west.
The Arctic Circle is one of the two polar circles and the most northerly of the five major circles of latitude as shown on maps of Earth.
A circle of latitude or line of latitude on Earth is an abstract east–west small circle connecting all locations around Earth (ignoring elevation) at a given latitude coordinate line.
Circles of latitude are unlike circles of longitude, which are all great circles with the centre of Earth in the middle, as the circles of latitude get smaller as the distance from the Equator increases.
A circle of latitude is perpendicular to all meridians.
The Equator is the longest circle of latitude and is the only circle of latitude which also is a great circle.
On a map, the circles of latitude may or may not be parallel, and their spacing may vary, depending on which projection is used to map the surface of the Earth onto a plane.
For instance, on a Mercator projection the circles of latitude are more widely spaced near the poles to preserve local scales and shapes, while on a Gall–Peters projection the circles of latitude are spaced more closely near the poles so that comparisons of area will be accurate.
There are many smaller terms, resulting in varying daily shifts of some metres in any direction.
54°40'N The border between 19th century Russian territories to the north and conflicting American and British land claims in western North America.
43°30'N In the US, the border between Minnesota and Iowa.
42°N Originally the northward limit of New Spain.
41°N In the US, part of the border between Wyoming and Utah, the border between Wyoming and Colorado, and part of the border between Nebraska and Colorado.

8°N Part of the border between Somalia and Ethiopia.
7°S A short section of the border between Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola.
The arts are a very wide range of human practices of creative expression, storytelling and cultural participation.
They can employ skill and imagination to produce objects, performances, convey insights and experiences, and construct new environments and spaces.
They can also develop or contribute to some particular aspect of a more complex art form, as in cinematography.
The first meaning of the word art is « way of doing ».
In its most basic abstract definition, art is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view, hear or experience it.
Such public rating is dependent on various subjective factors.
In Ancient Greece, all art and craft was referred to by the same word, techne.
Ancient Roman art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g. Zeus' thunderbolt).
In modern academia, the arts are usually grouped with or as a subset of the humanities.
The word architecture comes from the Greek arkhitekton, "master builder, director of works," from αρχι- (arkhi) "chief" + τεκτων (tekton) "builder, carpenter".
In modern usage, architecture is the art and discipline of creating, or inferring an implied or apparent plan of, a complex object or system.
Planned architecture manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing aesthetics.
While some ceramic products are considered fine art, some are considered to be decorative, industrial, or applied art objects.
In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery.
The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, stippling, and blending.
Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a still life or landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism), or political in nature (as in Artivism).
The noun "literature" comes from the Latin word littera meaning "an individual written character (letter)."
Each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature, meaning the product is performed over a period of time.
Dance is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (e.g. bee dance, mating dance), motion in inanimate objects (e.g. the leaves danced in the wind), and certain musical forms or genres.
The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context.
The composer Richard Wagner recognized the fusion of so many disciplines into a single work of opera, exemplified by his cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen ("The Ring of the Nibelung").
Other works in the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries have fused other disciplines in unique and creative ways, such as performance art.
John Cage is regarded by many as a performance artist rather than a composer, although he preferred the latter term.
The applied arts includes fields such as industrial design, illustration, and commercial art.
Within social sciences, cultural economists show how video games playing is conducive to the involvement in more traditional art forms and cultural practices, which suggests the complementarity between video games and the arts.
Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton "architect", from ἀρχι- "chief" and τέκτων "creator") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other structures.
The practice, which began in the prehistoric era, has been used as a way of expressing culture for civilizations on all seven continents.
In the 19th century, Louis Sullivan declared that "form follows function". "
Architecture began as rural, oral vernacular architecture that developed from trial and error to successful replication.
During the European Middle Ages, pan-European styles of Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals and abbeys emerged while the Renaissance favored Classical forms implemented by architects known by name.
Emphasis was put on modern techniques, materials, and simplified geometric forms, paving the way for high-rise superstructures.
A unifying or coherent form or structure.
The most important aspect of beauty was, therefore, an inherent part of an object, rather than something applied superficially, and was based on universal, recognisable truths.
In the 16th century, Italian Mannerist architect, painter and theorist Sebastiano Serlio wrote Tutte L’Opere D’Architettura et Prospetiva (Complete Works on Architecture and Perspective).
Gothic architecture, Pugin believed, was the only "true Christian form of architecture."
Among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach to building design are Rationalism, Empiricism, Structuralism, Poststructuralism, Deconstruction and Phenomenology.
The architecture and urbanism of the Classical civilizations such as the Greek and the Roman evolved from civic ideals rather than religious or empirical ones and new building types emerged.
Texts on architecture have been written since ancient time.
Buddhist architecture, in particular, showed great regional diversity.
The role of architect was usually one with that of master mason, or Magister lathomorum as they are sometimes described in contemporary documents.
Buildings were ascribed to specific architects – Brunelleschi, Alberti, Michelangelo, Palladio – and the cult of the individual had begun.
Formal architectural training in the 19th century, for example at École des Beaux-Arts in France, gave much emphasis to the production of beautiful drawings and little to context and feasibility.
Notable among these is the Deutscher Werkbund, formed in 1907 to produce better quality machine-made objects.
When modern architecture was first practised, it was an avant-garde movement with moral, philosophical, and aesthetic underpinnings.
The approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms, removing historical references and ornament in favor of functional details.
Architects such as Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Marcel Breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the Industrial Revolution, including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures.
The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws.
Environmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue, with a profound effect on the architectural profession.
This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment.
The U.S. Green Building Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system has been instrumental in this.
It can also be the initial design and plan for use, then later redesigned to accommodate a changed purpose, or a significantly revised design for adaptive reuse of the building shell.
Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, construction, trials, operation and maintenance, launching and dry-docking are the main activities involved.
Conversely, sacred architecture as a locale for meta-intimacy may also be non-monolithic, ephemeral and intensely private, personal and non-public.
With the rise of Christianity and Islam, religious buildings increasingly became centres of worship, prayer and meditation.
India was crisscrossed by trading routes of merchants from as far away as Siraf and China as well as weathering invasions by foreigners, resulting in multiple influences of foreign elements on native styles.
An existing example is at Nalanda (Bihar).
In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into chaitya-grihas (stupa halls).
Buddhist temples were developed rather later and outside South Asia, where Buddhism gradually declined from the early centuries CE onwards, though an early example is that of the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya in Bihar.
In Hindu belief, the temple represents the macrocosm of the universe as well as the microcosm of inner space.
It evolved over a period of more than 2000 years.
In addition, brick replaced stone, classical order was less strictly observed, mosaics replaced carved decoration, and complex domes were erected.
The earliest styles in Islamic architecture produced 'Arab-plan' or hypostyle mosques during the Umayyad Dynasty.
In iwan mosques, one or more iwans face a central courtyard that serves as the prayer hall.
The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area.
Consequently, mosque architects borrowed the shape of the bell tower for their minarets, which were used for essentially the same purpose – calling the faithful to prayer.
Although domes normally took on the shape of a hemisphere, the Mughals in India popularized onion-shaped domes in South Asia and Persia.
Usually opposite the entrance to the prayer hall is the qibla wall, which is the visually emphasized area inside the prayer hall.
In the qibla wall, usually at its center, is the mihrab, a niche or depression indicating the'qibla wall.
The mihrab serves as the location where the imam leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis.
It consists of a nave, transepts, and the altar stands at the east end (see cathedral diagram).
Most architectural historians regard Michelangelo's design of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome as a precursor to the Baroque style; this can be recognized by broader interior spaces (replacing long narrow naves), more playful attention to light and shadow, extensive ornamentation, large frescoes, focus on interior art, and frequently, a dramatic central exterior projection.
While secular structures clearly had the greater influence on the development of modern architecture, several excellent examples of modern architecture can be found in religious buildings of the 20th century.
It has been described as a "phalanx of fighters" turned on their tails and pointing heavenward.
The Temple at Independence, Missouri was conceived by Japanese architect Gyo Obata after the concept of the chambered nautilus.
The Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń on the other hand is a much more traditional edifice.
An architectural style is a set of characteristics and features that make a building or other structure notable or historically identifiable.
Most architecture can be classified within a chronology of styles which changes over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible.
At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas.
For instance, Renaissance ideas emerged in Italy around 1425 and spread to all of Europe over the next 200 years, with the French, German, English, and Spanish Renaissances showing recognisably the same style, but with unique characteristics.
After an architectural style has gone out of fashion, revivals and re-interpretations may occur.
The Spanish mission style was revived 100 years later as the Mission Revival, and that soon evolved into the Spanish Colonial Revival.
An example of Mannerist architecture is the Villa Farnese at Caprarola in the rugged country side outside of Rome.
Through Antwerp, Renaissance and Mannerist styles were widely introduced in England, Germany, and northern and eastern Europe in general.
The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms.
Architectural theory is the act of thinking, discussing, and writing about architecture.
Architectural theory is often didactic, and theorists tend to stay close to or work from within schools.
This does not mean, however, that such works did not exist, given that many works never survived antiquity.
Probably written between 27 and 23 BC, it is the only major contemporary source on classical architecture to have survived.
It also proposes the three fundamental laws that architecture must obey, in order to be so considered: firmitas, utilitas, venustas, translated in the 17th century by Sir Henry Wotton into the English slogan firmness, commodity and delight (meaning structural adequacy, functional adequacy, and beauty).
Since the architectural theories were on structures, fewer of them were transcribed.
These theories anticipated the development of Functionalism in modern architecture.
This in turn formed the basis for Art Nouveau in the UK, exemplified by the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and influenced the Vienna Secession.
The generation born during the middle-third of the 19th century was largely enthralled with the opportunities presented by Semper's combination of a breathtaking historical scope and a methodological granularity.
The Modern Movement rejected these thoughts and Le Corbusier energetically dismissed the work.
Another influential planning theorist of this time was Ebenezer Howard, who founded the garden city movement.
An early use of the term modern architecture in print occurred in the title of a book by Otto Wagner, who gave examples of his own work representative of the Vienna Secession with art nouveau illustrations, and didactic teachings to his students.
Frank Lloyd Wright, while modern in rejecting historic revivalism, was idiosyncratic in his theory, which he conveyed in copious writing.
Wright was more poetic and firmly maintained the 19th-century view of the creative artist as unique genius.
This has also been the case with educators in academia like Dalibor Vesely or Alberto-Perez Gomez, and in more recent years this philosophical orientation has been reinforced through the research of a new generation of theorists (E.G. Jeffrey Kipnis or Sanford Kwinter).
Others, like Beatriz Colomina and Mary McLeod, expand historical understandings of architecture to include lesser or minor discourses that have influenced the development of architectural ideas over time.
In their theories, architecture is compared to a language which can be invented and re-invented every time it is used.
Since 2000, architectural theory has also had to face the rapid rise of urbanism and globalization.
In the past decade, there has been the emergence of the so-called "Digital" Architecture.
Architects also design organic-looking buildings in the attempt to develop a new formal language.
Since these new architectural tendencies emerged, many theorists and architects have been working on these issues, developing theories and ideas such as Patrick Schumacher's Parametricism.
Byzantine architecture is the architecture of the Byzantine Empire, or Eastern Roman Empire.
Magnificent golden mosaics with their graphic simplicity brought light and warmth into the heart of churches.
Some of the columns were also made of marble.
Precious wood furniture, like beds, chairs, stools, tables, bookshelves and silver or golden cups with beautiful reliefs, decorated Byzantine interiors.
For Classical temples, only the exterior was important, because only the priests entered the interior, where the statue of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated was kept.
Those in the Cathedral of Saint Mark, Venice (1071) specially attracted John Ruskin's fancy.
On eastern columns the eagle, the lion and the lamb are occasionally carved, but treated conventionally.
Composite columns line the principal space of the nave.
The columns are filled with foliage in all sorts of variations.
Other structures include the ruins of the Great Palace of Constantinople, the innovative walls of Constantinople (with 192 towers) and Basilica Cistern (with hundreds of recycled classical columns).
The Paleologan period is well represented in a dozen former churches in Istanbul, notably St Saviour at Chora and St Mary Pammakaristos.
The Church of the Holy Apostles (Thessaloniki) is cited as an archetypal structure of the late period with its exterior walls intricately decorated with complex brickwork patterns or with glazed ceramics.
At Saint Sergius, Constantinople, and San Vitale, Ravenna, churches of the central type, the space under the dome was enlarged by having apsidal additions made to the octagon.
This unbroken area, about 260 ft (80 m) long, the larger part of which is over 100 ft (30 m) wide, is entirely covered by a system of domical surfaces.
At the Holy Apostles (6th century) five domes were applied to a cruciform plan; the central dome was the highest.
Sometimes the central space was square, sometimes octagonal, or at least there were eight piers supporting the dome instead of four, and the nave and transepts were narrower in proportion.
Still in front put a square court.
Directly under the center of the dome is the ambo, from which the Scriptures were proclaimed, and beneath the ambo at floor level was the place for the choir of singers.
Rows of rising seats around the curve of the apse with the patriarch's throne at the middle eastern point formed the synthronon.
The domes and vaults to the exterior were covered with lead or with tiling of the Roman variety.
There are considerable Byzantine influences which can be detected in the distinctive early Islamic monuments in Syria (709–715).
Bricks 70 cm x 35 cm x 5 cm were used, and these bricks were glued together using mortar approximately 5 cm thick.
Perhaps the most definite feature of the Hagia Irene is the strict contrast between the interior and exterior design.
This style influenced the construction of several other buildings, such as St. Peter's Basilica.
The construction of the final version of the Hagia Sophia, which still stands today, was overseen by Emperor Justinian.
Gothic architecture (or pointed architecture) is an architectural style that was particularly popular in Europe from the late 12th century to the 16th century, during the High and Late Middle Ages, surviving into the 17th and 18th centuries in some areas.
The style at the time was sometimes known as opus Francigenum (lit.
The primary engineering innovation and one of the other characteristic design components is the flying buttress.
However, there is no evidence to indicate that there was a connection between Armenian architecture and the development of the Gothic style in Western Europe.
Thus the Gothic style, being in opposition to classical architecture, from that point of view was associated with the destruction of advancement and sophistication.
The term ‘Saracen’ was still in use in the 18th century and it typically referred to all Muslim conquerors, including the Moors and Arabs.
His aversion of the style was so strong that he refused to put a Gothic roof on the new St. Paul's, despite being pressured to do so.
Several authors have taken a stance against this allegation, claiming that the Gothic style had most likely filtered into Europe in other ways, for example through Spain or Sicily.
It was also influenced by theological doctrines which called for more light and by technical improvements in vaults and buttresses that allowed much greater height and larger windows.
Rib-vaults were employed in some parts of the cathedral at Durham (1093–) and in Lessay Abbey in Normandy (1098).
The Duchy of Normandy, part of the Angevin Empire until the 13th century, developed its own version of Gothic.
One example of early Norman Gothic is Bayeux Cathedral (1060–70) where the Romanesque cathedral nave and choir were rebuilt into the Gothic style.
Coutances Cathedral was remade into Gothic beginning about 1220.
Suger reconstructed portions of the old Romanesque church with the rib vault in order to remove walls and to make more space for windows.
In addition, he installed a circular rose window over the portal on the facade.
Durham Cathedral was the first cathedral to employ a rib vault, built between 1093 and 1104.
One of the builders who is believed to have worked on Sens Cathedral, William of Sens, later travelled to England and became the architect who, between 1175 and 1180, reconstructed the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in the new Gothic style.
French Gothic churches were heavily influenced both by the ambulatory and side-chapels around the choir at Saint-Denis, and by the paired towers and triple doors on the western façade.
The builders of Notre-Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the upper walls.
His work was continued by William the Englishman who replaced his French namesake in 1178.
Tiercerons – decorative vaulting ribs – seem first to be have been used in vaulting at Lincoln Cathedral, installed c.1200.
The first building in the High Gothic was Chartres Cathedral, an important pilgrimage church south of Paris.
The walls were filled with stained glass, mainly depicting the story of the Virgin Mary but also, in a small corner of each window, illustrating the crafts of the guilds who donated those windows.
In central Europe, the High Gothic style appeared in the Holy Roman Empire, first at Toul (1220–), whose Romanesque cathedral was rebuilt in the style of Reims Cathedral; then Trier's Liebfrauenkirche parish church (1228–), and then throughout the Reich, beginning with the Elisabethkirche at Marburg (1235–) and the cathedral at Metz (c.1235–).
Lancet windows were supplanted by multiple lights separated by geometrical bar-tracery.
Other characteristics of the High Gothic were the development of rose windows of greater size, using bar-tracery, higher and longer flying buttresses, which could reach up to the highest windows, and walls of sculpture illustrating biblical stories filling the facade and the fronts of the transept.
The high and thin walls of French Rayonnant Gothic allowed by the flying buttresses enabled increasingly ambitious expanses of glass and decorated tracery, reinforced with ironwork.
Masons elaborated a series of tracery patterns for windows – from the basic geometrical to the reticulated and the curvilinear – which had superseded the lancet window.
Churches with features of this style include Westminster Abbey (1245–), the cathedrals at Lichfield (after 1257–) and Exeter (1275–), Bath Abbey (1298–), and the retro choir at Wells Cathedral (c.1320–).
Use of ogees was especially common.
Examples of French flamboyant building include the west façade of Rouen Cathedral, and especially the façades of Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes (1370s) and choir Mont-Saint-Michel's abbey church (1448).
It first appeared in the cloisters and chapter-house (c. 1332) of Old St Paul's Cathedral in London by William de Ramsey.
Perpendicular is sometimes called Third Pointed and was employed over three centuries; the fan-vaulted staircase at Christ Church, Oxford built around 1640.
The Kings of France had first-hand knowledge of the new Italian style, because of the military campaign of Charles VIII to Naples and Milan (1494), and especially the campaigns of Louis XII and Francis I (1500–1505) to restore French control over Milan and Genoa.
The Château de Blois (1515–24) introduced the Renaissance loggia and open stairway.
Under Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, England was largely isolated from architectural developments on the continent.
Shute published the first book in English on classical architecture in 1570.
The pointed arch did not originate in Gothic architecture; they had been employed for centuries in the Near East in pre-Islamic as well as Islamic architecture for arches, arcades, and ribbed vaults.
They were also sometimes used for more practical purposes, such as to bring transverse vaults to the same height as diagonal vaults, as in the nave and aisles of Durham Cathedral, built in 1093.
Unlike the semi-circular barrel vault of Roman and Romanesque buildings, where the weight pressed directly downward, and required thick walls and small windows, the Gothic rib vault was made of diagonal crossing arched ribs.
The outward thrust against the walls was countered by the weight of buttresses and later flying buttresses.
They were very difficult to build, and could only cross a limited space.
The alternating rows of alternating columns and piers receiving the weight of the vaults was replaced by simple pillars, each receiving the same weight.
The first of these new vaults had an additional rib, called a tierceron, which ran down the median of the vault.
These vaults often copied the forms form of the elaborate tracery of the Late Gothic styles.
A second type was called a reticulated vault, which had a network of additional decorative ribs, in triangles and other geometric forms, placed between or over the traverse ribs.
An example is the cloister of Gloucester Cathedral (c. 1370).
They were used later at Sens, at Notre-Dame de Paris and at Canterbury in England.
In the High Gothic period, a new form was introduced, composed of a central core surrounded several attached slender columns, or colonettes, going up to the vaults.
In England, the clustered columns were often ornamented with stone rings, as well as columns with carved leaves.
In place of the Corinthian capital, some columns used a stiff-leaf design.
In later structures, the buttresses often had several arches, each reaching in to a different level of the structure.
The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rainwater off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone gargoyles placed in rows on the buttresses.
They also had a practical purpose; they often served as bell towers supporting belfries, whose bells told the time by announcing religious services, warned of fire or enemy attack, and celebrated special occasions like military victories and coronations.
Since cathedral construction usually took many years, and was extremely expensive, by the time the tower were to be built public enthusiasm waned, and tastes changed.
Chartres would have been even more exuberant if the second plan had been followed; it called for seven towers around the transept and sanctuary.
The early and High Gothic Laon Cathedral has a square lantern tower over the crossing of the transept; two towers on the western front; and two towers on the ends of the transepts.
In Normandy, cathedrals and major churches often had multiple towers, built over the centuries; the Abbaye aux Hommes (begun 1066), Caen has nine towers and spires, placed on the facade, the transepts, and the centre.
A variation of the spire was the flèche, a slender, spear-like spire, which was usually placed on the transept where it crossed the nave.
Amiens Cathedral has a flèche.
It was removed in 1786 during a program to modernise the cathedral, but was put back in a new form designed by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc.
In English Gothic, the major tower was often placed at the crossing of the transept and nave, and was much higher than the other.
A crossing tower was constructed at Canterbury Cathedral in 1493–1501 by John Wastell, who had previously worked on King's College at Cambridge.
An unusual double arch had to be constructed in the centre of the crossing to give the tower the extra support it needed.
Construction began again in 1724 to the design of Nicholas Hawksmoor, after first Christopher Wren had proposed a design in 1710, but stopped again in 1727.
Cologne Cathedral had been started in the 13th century, following the plan of Amiens Cathedral, but only the apse and the base of one tower were finished in the Gothic period.
The tower of Ulm Minster has a similar history, begun in 1377, stopped in 1543, and not completed until the 19th century.
Burgos Cathedral was more inspired by Northern Europe.
Plate tracery was the first type of tracery to be developed, emerging in the later phase of Early Gothic or First Pointed.
Tracery is practical as well as decorative, because the increasingly large windows of Gothic buildings needed maximum support against the wind.
Plate tracery reached the height of its sophistication with the 12th century windows of Chartres Cathedral and in the "Dean's Eye" rose window at Lincoln Cathedral.
Stone bar-tracery, an important decorative element of Gothic styles, first was used at Reims Cathedral shortly after 1211, in the chevet built by Jean D'Orbais.
Bar-tracery became common after c.1240, with increasing complexity and decreasing weight.
Rayonnant also deployed mouldings of two different types in tracery, where earlier styles had used moulding of a single size, with different sizes of mullions.
The mullions of Geometrical style typically had capitals with curved bars emerging from them.
The mullions were in consequence branched into Y-shaped designs further ornamented with cusps.
Second Pointed (14th century) saw Intersecting tracery elaborated with ogees, creating a complex reticular (net-like) design known as Reticulated tracery.
These shapes are known as daggers, fish-bladders, or mouchettes.
Perpendicular strove for verticality and dispensed with the Curvilinear style's sinuous lines in favour of unbroken straight mullions from top to bottom, transected by horizontal transoms and bars.
The transoms were often topped by miniature crenellations.
It frequently covered the facades, and the interior walls of the nave and choir were covered with blind arcades.
2 Vaults Barrel or groin Ribbed Ribbed vaults appeared in the Romanesque era and were elaborated in the Gothic era.
They have a long nave making the body of the church, where the parishioners worshipped; a transverse arm called the transept and, beyond it to the east, the choir, also known as a chancel or presbytery, that was usually reserved for the clergy.
A passage called the ambulatory circled the choir.
The early cathedrals, like Notre-Dame, had six-part rib vaults, with alternating columns and piers, while later cathedrals had the simpler and stronger four-part vaults, with identical columns.
Transepts were usually short in early French Gothic architecture, but became longer and were given large rose windows in the Rayonnant period.
In England, transepts were more important, and the floor plans were usually much more complex than in French cathedrals, with the addition of attached Lady Chapels, an octagonal Chapter House, and other structures (See plans of Salisbury Cathedral and York Minster below).
An elevation typically had four levels.
Above that was a narrower gallery, called the triforium, which also helped provide additional thickness and support.
This system was used at Noyon Cathedral, Sens Cathedral, and other early structures.
The tribune disappeared, which meant that the arcades could be higher.
A similar arrangement was adapted in England, at Salisbury Cathedral, Lincoln Cathedral, and Ely Cathedral.
This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls.
Beauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology.
Gothic facades were adapted from the model of the Romanesque facades.
The sculpture of the central tympanum was devoted to the Last Judgement, that to the left to the Virgin Mary, and that to the right to the Saints honoured at that particular cathedral.
They followed the doctrine expressed by Saint Thomas Aquinas that beauty was a "harmony of contrasts."
In England the rose window was often replaced by several lancet windows.
The portals were crowned with high arched gables, composed of concentric arches filled with sculpture.
The towers were adorned with their own arches, often crowned with pinnacles.
While French cathedrals emphasised the height of the facade, English cathedrals, particularly in earlier Gothic, often emphasised the width.
He broke away from the French emphasis on height, and eliminated the column statutes and statuary in the arched entries, and covered the facade with colourful mosaics of biblical scenes (The current mosaics are of a later date).
The sculptor Andrea Pisano made the celebrated bronze doors for Florence Baptistry (1330–1336).
There is usually a single or double ambulatory, or aisle, around the choir and east end, so parishioners and pilgrims could walk freely easily around east end.
Abbot Suger first used the novel combination rib vaults and buttresses to replace the thick walls and replace them with stained glass, opening up that portion of the church to what he considered "divine light".
There are three such chapels at Chartres Cathedral, seven at Notre Dame de Paris, Amiens Cathedral, Prague Cathedral and Cologne Cathedral, and nine at Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua in Italy.
An edict of the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 had declared: "The composition of religious images is not to be left to the inspiration of artists; it is derived from the principles put in place by the Catholic Church and religious tradition.
Gradually, as the style evolved, the sculpture became more and more prominent, taking over the columns of the portal, and gradually climbing above the portals, until statues in niches covered the entire facade, as in Wells Cathedral, to the transepts, and, as at Amiens Cathedral, even on the interior of the facade.
This set a pattern of complex iconography which was followed at other churches.
The tympanum over the central portal on the west façade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven.
The torments of hell were even more vividly depicted.
They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshippers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.
They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc during the 19th-century restoration.
Religious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a 6th-century mystic whose book, De Coelesti Hierarchia, was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine.
The windows on the north side, frequently in the shade, had windows depicting the Old Testament.
The details were painted onto the glass in vitreous enamel, then baked in a kiln to fuse the enamel on the glass.
Sainte-Chapelle became the model for other chapels across Europe.
Clear glass was dipped into coloured glass, then portions of the coloured glass were ground away to give exactly the right shade.
One of the most celebrated Flamboyant buildings was the Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes (1370s), with walls of glass from floor to ceiling.
The stained glass windows were extremely complex and expensive to create.
The rose was a symbol of the Virgin Mary, and they were particularly used in churches dedicated to her, including Notre-Dame de Paris.
The Palais de la Cité in Paris, close to Notre-Dame de Paris, begun in 1119, which was the principal residence of the French kings until 1417.
However, it was soon made obsolete by the development of artillery, and in the 15th century it was remodelled into a comfortable residential palace.
The oldest existing example in England is probably the Mob Quad of Merton College at Oxford University, constructed between 1288 and 1378.
A similar kind of academic cloister was created at Queen's College, Oxford in the 1140s, likely designed by Reginald Ely.
Some colleges, like Balliol College, Oxford, borrowed a military style from Gothic castles, with battlements and crenolated walls.
He wrote in 1447 that he wanted his chapel "to proceed in large form, clean and substantial, setting apart superfluity of too great curious works of entail and busy moulding."
The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, a crennellated parapet with merlons, and projecting machicolations from which missiles could be dropped on besiegers.
Castles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge.
One good surviving example is the Château de Dourdan, near Nemours.
The conversion implied compromises since Latin churches are oriented towards the East and mosques are oriented towards Mecca.
Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque, in Famagusta, Northern Cyprus.
The Gothic style began to be described as outdated, ugly and even barbaric.
Ireland was an island of Gothic architecture in the 17th and 18th centuries, with the construction of Derry Cathedral (completed 1633), Sligo Cathedral (c. 1730), and Down Cathedral (1790–1818) are other examples.
The two western towers of Westminster Abbey were constructed between 1722 and 1745 by Nicholas Hawksmoor, opening a new period of Gothic Revival.
This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855–1885, is known in Britain as High Victorian Gothic.
From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types.
Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces in the landscape aspect of the design – large or small, urban, suburban and rural, and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while integrating ecological sustainability.
They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work.
The first person to write of making a landscape was Joseph Addison in 1712.
During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect began to be used by professional landscapes designers, and was firmly established after Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. and Beatrix Jones (later Farrand) with others founded the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) in 1899.
Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes.
Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans.
In recent years the need and interest of therapeutic gardens have been increasingly rising.
Among these were Central Park in New York City, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York and Boston's Emerald Necklace park system.
She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including: Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey; Yale in New Haven, Connecticut; and the Arnold Arboretum for Harvard in Boston, Massachusetts.
Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects, and in general, the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners.
Roberto Burle Marx in Brazil combined the International style and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic.
He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place.
Once recognized by AILA, landscape architects use the title 'Registered Landscape Architect' across the six states and territories within Australia.
Within NZ, Members of NZILA when they achieve their professional standing, can use the title Registered Landscape Architect NZILA.
ILASA's mission is to advance the profession of landscape architecture and uphold high standards of professional service to its members, and to represent the profession of landscape architecture in any matter which may affect the interests of the members of the institute.
At present there are fifteen accredited programmes in the UK.
In 2008, the LI launched a major recruitment drive entitled "I want to be a Landscape Architect" to encourage the study of Landscape Architecture.
Several states require passage of a state exam as well.
By the 6th century BC, the sand already covered the statues of the main temple up to their knees.
One scheme to save the temples was based on an idea by William MacQuitty to build a clear freshwater dam around the temples, with the water inside kept at the same height as the Nile.
They considered that raising the temples ignored the effect of erosion of the sandstone by desert winds.
Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was carefully cut into large blocks (up to 30 tons, averaging 20 tons), dismantled, lifted and reassembled in a new location 65 metres higher and 200 metres back from the river, in one of the greatest challenges of archaeological engineering in history.
Many visitors also arrive by plane at an airfield that was specially constructed for the temple complex, or by road from Aswan, the nearest city.
The colossal statues along the left-hand wall bear the white crown of Upper Egypt, while those on the opposite side are wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt (pschent).
The most famous relief shows the king on his chariot shooting arrows against his fleeing enemies, who are being taken prisoner.
There are depictions of Ramesses and Nefertari with the sacred boats of Amun and Ra-Horakhty.
These dates are allegedly the king's birthday and coronation day, respectively.
In fact, according to calculations made on the basis of the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Sothis) and inscriptions found by archaeologists, this date must have been October 22.
This was in fact the second time in ancient Egyptian history that a temple was dedicated to a queen.
Traditionally, the statues of the queens stood next to those of the pharaoh, but were never taller than his knees.
The capitals of the pillars bear the face of the goddess Hathor; this type of column is known as Hathoric.
On the south and the north walls of this chamber there are two graceful and poetic bas-reliefs of the king and his consort presenting papyrus plants to Hathor, who is depicted as a cow on a boat sailing in a thicket of papyri.
None of the current buildings are believed to date from before the 17th century, but they were likely built with the same construction methods and designs as had been used for centuries before.
Other kasbahs and ksour were located all along this route, such as the nearby Tamdaght to the north.
The village's buildings are grouped together within a defensive wall that includes corner towers and a gate.
The village also has a number of public or community buildings such as a mosque, a caravanserai, a kasbah (castle-like fortification) and the Marabout of Sidi Ali or Amer.
It was made of compressed earth and mud, usually mixed with other materials to aid adhesion.
The Aswan Dam, or more specifically since the 1960s, the Aswan High Dam, is the world's largest embankment dam, which was built across the Nile in Aswan, Egypt, between 1960 and 1970.
Like the earlier implementation, the High Dam has had a significant effect on the economy and culture of Egypt.
However, this natural flooding varied, since high-water years could destroy the whole crop, while low-water years could create widespread drought and consequently famine.
Instead the Nile Valley Plan by the British hydrologist Harold Edwin Hurst was favored, which proposed to store water in Sudan and Ethiopia, where evaporation is much lower.
Initially, both the United States and the USSR were interested in helping development of the dam.
At that time the U.S. feared that communism would spread to the Middle East, and it saw Nasser as a natural leader of an anticommunist procapitalist Arab League.
After the UN criticized a raid by Israel against Egyptian forces in Gaza in 1955, Nasser realized that he could not portray himself as the leader of pan-Arab nationalism if he could not defend his country militarily against Israel.
Nasser did not accept these conditions, and consulted the USSR for support.
Dulles was angered more by Nasser's diplomatic recognition of China, which was in direct conflict with Dulles's policy of containment of communism.
He was also irritated by Nasser's neutrality and attempts to play both sides of the Cold War.
The enormous rock and clay dam was designed by the Soviet Hydroproject Institute along with some Egyptian engineers.
Conversely, the dam flooded a large area, causing the relocation of over 100,000 people.
The assessment of the costs and benefits of the dam remains controversial decades after its completion.
Not taking into account the negative environmental and social effects of the dam, its costs are thus estimated to have been recovered within only two years.
Another observer disagreed and he recommended that the dam should be torn down.
The dam mitigated the effects of floods, such as those in 1964, 1973, and 1988.
A new fishing industry has been created around Lake Nasser, though it is struggling due to its distance from any significant markets.
About half a million families were settled on these new lands.
On other previously irrigated land, yields increased because water could be made available at critical low-flow periods.
In Sudan, 50,000 to 70,000 Sudanese Nubians were moved from the old town of Wadi Halfa and its surrounding villages.
The government developed an irrigation project, called the New Halfa Agricultural Development Scheme to grow cotton, grains, sugar cane and other crops.
Housing and facilities were built for 47 village units whose relationship to each other approximated that in Old Nubia.
The nutrient value added to the land by the sediment was only 6,000 tons of potash, 7,000 tons of phosphorus pentoxide and 17,000 tons of nitrogen.
Soil salinity also increased because the distance between the surface and the groundwater table was small enough (1–2 m depending on soil conditions and temperature) to allow water to be pulled up by evaporation so that the relatively small concentrations of salt in the groundwater accumulated on the soil surface over the years.
By the 1950s only a small proportion of Upper Egypt had not been converted from basin (low transmission) to perennial (high transmission) irrigation.
S. haematobium has since disappeared altogether.
This means that the dead storage volume would be filled up after 300–500 years if the sediment accumulated at the same rate throughout the area of the lake.
After construction of the dam, aquatic weeds grew much faster in the clearer water, helped by fertilizer residues.
Mediterranean fishing and brackish water lake fishery declined after the dam was finished because nutrients that flowed down the Nile to the Mediterranean were trapped behind the dam.
A concern before the construction of the High Dam had been the potential drop in river-bed level downstream of the Dam as the result of erosion caused by the flow of sediment-free water.
The red-brick construction industry, which consisted of hundreds of factories that used Nile sediment deposits along the river, has also been negatively affected.
Because of the lower turbidity of the water sunlight penetrates deeper in the Nile water.
Construction work began in 1995 and, after some US$220 million had been spent, the complex was officially inaugurated on 16 October 2002.
The recreation of the ancient library was not only adopted by other individuals and agencies, it garnered support from Egyptian politicians.
UNESCO's involvement beginning in 1986 created a great opportunity for the project to truly be international in focus.
This architectural team consisted of ten members representing six countries.
The first pledges were made for funding the project at a conference held in 1990 in Aswan: USD $65 million, mostly from the MENA states.
In 2010, the library received a donation of 500,000 books from the National Library of France, Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF).
The main reading room stands beneath a 32-meter-high glass-panelled roof, tilted out toward the sea like a sundial, and measuring some 160 m in diameter.
Holding approximately 1,316 artifacts, the Antiquities Museum collection provides a glimpse into Egyptian history from the Pharaonic era to the conquest of Alexander the Great to the Roman civilizations before the advent of Islam across Egypt.
Microfilm: This section includes microfilms of around 30,000 rare manuscripts and 50,000 documents, as well as a collection from The British Library of around 14,000 Arabic, Persian, and Turkish manuscripts, which is considered the largest collection in Europe.
However, in 2010 the library received an additional 500,000 books from the Bibliothèque nationale de France.)
The Great Mosque of Djenné is a large banco or adobe building that is considered by many architects to be one of the greatest achievements of the Sudano-Sahelian architectural style.
The earliest document mentioning the mosque is Abd al-Sadi's Tarikh al-Sudan which gives the early history, presumably from the oral tradition as it existed in the mid-seventeenth century.
His immediate successor built the towers of the mosque while the following Sultan built the surrounding wall.
This would have been the building that Caillié saw.
The new mosque was a large, low building lacking any towers or ornamentation.
The rebuilding was completed in 1907 using forced labour under the direction of Ismaila Traoré, head of Djenné's guild of masons.
There has been debate as to what extent the design of the rebuilt mosque was subject to French influence.
He thought that the cones made the building resemble a baroque temple dedicated to the god of suppositories.
He also says that local people were so unhappy with the new building that they refused to clean it, only doing so when threatened with prison.
The larger tomb to the south contains the remains of Almany Ismaïla, an important imam of the 18th century.
In some cases, the original surfaces of a mosque have even been tiled over, destroying its historical appearance and in some cases compromising the building's structural integrity.
In 1996, Vogue magazine held a fashion shoot inside the mosque.
It is accessed by six sets of stairs, each decorated with pinnacles.
The prayer wall or qibla of the Great Mosque faces east towards Mecca and overlooks the city marketplace.
The cone shaped spires or pinnacles at the top of each minaret are topped with ostrich eggs.
The small, irregularly-positioned windows on the north and south walls allow little natural light to reach the interior of the hall.
The imam conducts the prayers from the mihrab in the larger central tower.
To the right of the mihrab in the central tower is a second niche, the pulpit or minbar, from which the imam preaches his Friday sermon.
The walls of the galleries facing the courtyard are punctuated by arched openings.
Rather than a single central niche, the mihrab tower originally had a pair of large recesses echoing the form of the entrance arches in the north wall.
It requires several days to cure but needs to be periodically stirred, a task usually falling to young boys who play in the mixture, thus stirring up the contents.
A race is held at the beginning of the festival to see who will be the first to deliver the plaster to the mosque.
In 1930, an inexact replica of the Djenné Mosque was built in the town of Fréjus in southern France.
The original mosque presided over one of the most important Islamic learning centers in Africa during the Middle Ages, with thousands of students coming to study the Quran in Djenné's madrassas.
On 20 January 2006 the sight of a team of men hacking at the roof of the mosque sparked a riot in the town.
In the mosque the mob ripped out the ventilation fans that had been presented by the US Embassy at the time of the Iraq War and then went on a rampage through the town.
The Great Sphinx of Giza, commonly referred to as the Sphinx of Giza or just the Sphinx, is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature.
Furthermore, the angle and location of the south wall of the enclosure suggests the causeway connecting Khafre's Pyramid and Valley Temple already existed before the Sphinx was planned.
When the Stele was re-excavated in 1925, the lines of text referring to Khaf flaked off and were destroyed.
The cult of the Sphinx continued into medieval times.
Alexandria, Rosetta, Damietta, Cairo and the Giza Pyramids are described repeatedly, but not necessarily comprehensively.
Seven years after visiting Giza, André Thévet (Cosmographie de Levant, 1556) described the Sphinx as "the head of a colossus, caused to be made by Isis, daughter of Inachus, then so beloved of Jupiter".
Johannes Helferich's (1579) Sphinx is a pinched-face, round-breasted woman with a straight haired wig; the only edge over Thévet is that the hair suggests the flaring lappets of the headdress.
Although certain tracts on the Stela are likely accurate, this passage is contradicted by archaeological evidence, thus considered to be Late Period historical revisionism, a purposeful fake, created by the local priests as an attempt to imbue the contemporary Isis temple with an ancient history it never had.
Recent discoveries, however, strongly show that it was really not built before the reign of Khafre, in the fourth dynasty."
Maspero believed the Sphinx to be "the most ancient monument in Egypt".
Part of its headdress had fallen off in 1926 due to erosion, which had also cut deeply into its neck.
The layer in which the head was sculpted is much harder.
Other tales ascribe it to being the work of Mamluks.
According to al-Maqrīzī, many people living in the area believed that the increased sand covering the Giza Plateau was retribution for al-Dahr's act of defacement.
Al-Minufi stated that the Alexandrian Crusade in 1365 was divine punishment for a Sufi sheikh of the khanqah of Sa'id breaking off the nose.
The idea is considered pseudoarchaeology by academia, because no textual or archaeological evidence supports this to be the reason for the orientation of the Sphinx.
There is a long history of speculation about hidden chambers beneath the Sphinx, by esoteric figures such as H. Spencer Lewis.
It is believed to be the second most visited historical site in Egypt; only the Giza pyramid complex near Cairo receives more visits.
The three other parts, the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Montu, and the dismantled Temple of Amenhotep IV, are closed to the public.
The original temple was destroyed and partially restored by Hatshepsut, although another pharaoh built around it in order to change the focus or orientation of the sacred area.
Construction of temples started in the Middle Kingdom and continued into Ptolemaic times.
The deities represented range from some of the earliest worshiped to those worshiped much later in the history of the Ancient Egyptian culture.
These architraves may have been lifted to these heights using levers.
If stone had been used for the ramps, they would have been able to use much less material.
Final carving was executed after the drums were put in place so that it was not damaged while being placed.
The city of Thebes does not appear to have been of great significance before the Eleventh Dynasty and previous temple building there would have been relatively small, with shrines being dedicated to the early deities of Thebes, the Earth goddess Mut and Montu.
Amun (sometimes called Amen) was long the local tutelary deity of Thebes.
Major construction work in the Precinct of Amun-Re took place during the Eighteenth Dynasty, when Thebes became the capital of the unified Ancient Egypt.
Another of her projects at the site, Karnak's Red Chapel or Chapelle Rouge, was intended as a barque shrine and originally may have stood between her two obelisks.
Known as the unfinished obelisk, it provides evidence of how obelisks were quarried.
The last major change to the Precinct of Amun-Re's layout was the addition of the First Pylon and the massive enclosure walls that surround the whole precinct, both constructed by Nectanebo I of the Thirtieth Dynasty.
The Karnak temple complex is first described by an unknown Venetian in 1589, although his account gives no name for the complex.
Protais' writing about their travel was published by Melchisédech Thévenot (Relations de divers voyages curieux, 1670s–1696 editions) and Johann Michael Vansleb (The Present State of Egypt, 1678).
Following excavation and restoration works by the Johns Hopkins University team, led by Betsy Bryan (see below) the Precinct of Mut has been opened to the public.
In 2006, Betsy Bryan presented her findings of one festival that included apparent intentional overindulgence in alcohol.
These findings were made in the temple of Mut because when Thebes rose to greater prominence, Mut absorbed the warrior goddesses, Sekhmet and Bast, as some of her aspects.
In a later myth developed around the annual drunken Sekhmet festival, Ra, by then the sun god of Upper Egypt, created her from a fiery eye gained from his mother, to destroy mortals who conspired against him (Lower Egypt).
The Luxor Temple is a large Ancient Egyptian temple complex located on the east bank of the Nile River in the city today known as Luxor (ancient Thebes) and was constructed approximately 1400 BCE.
Four of the major mortuary temples visited by early travelers include the Temple of Seti I at Gurnah, the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el Bahri, the Temple of Ramesses II (i.e., Ramesseum), and the Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu.
To the rear of the temple are chapels built by Amenhotep III of the 18th Dynasty, and Alexander.
This sandstone is referred to as Nubian sandstone.
Alexander Badawy, "Illusionism in Egyptian Architecture," Studies in the Ancient Oriental Civilization, 35 (1969): 23.
Along the avenue the stations were set up for ceremonies such as the Feast of Opet which held significance to temple.
Lalibela is a town in Lasta district of North Wollo Zone in Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
To Christians, Lalibela is one of Ethiopia's holiest cities, second only to Axum, and a center of pilgrimage.
The names of several places in the modern town and the general layout of the rock-cut churches themselves are said to mimic names and patterns observed by Lalibela during the time he spent as a youth in Jerusalem and the Holy Land.
Christian faith inspires many features with Biblical names – even Lalibela's river is known as the River Jordan.
Portuguese priest Francisco Álvares (1465–1540), accompanied the Portuguese Ambassador on his visit to Dawit II in the 1520s.
The next reported European visitor to Lalibela was Miguel de Castanhoso, who served as a soldier under Cristóvão da Gama and left Ethiopia in 1544.
Its pillars were likewise cut from the mountain."),
There is some controversy as to when some of the churches were constructed.
His report described two types of vernacular housing found in the area.
Saint Catherine's Monastery, officially Sacred Monastery of the God-Trodden Mount Sinai, is an Eastern Orthodox monastery located on the Sinai Peninsula, at the mouth of a gorge at the foot of Mount Sinai, near the town of Saint Catherine, Egypt.
The Saint Catherine monastery is located in the shadow of a group of three mountains; Ras Sufsafeh (possibly "Mount Horeb" c.1 km west), Jebel Arrenziyeb and Jebel Musa, the "Biblical Mount Sinai" (peak c.2 km south).
Catherine herself ordered the execution to commence.
The monastery was built by order of Emperor Justinian I (reigned 527–565), enclosing the Chapel of the Burning Bush (also known as "Saint Helen's Chapel") ordered to be built by Empress Consort Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, at the site where Moses is supposed to have seen the burning bush.
The site is sacred to Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.
During the seventh century, the isolated Christian anchorites of the Sinai were eliminated: only the fortified monastery remained.
From the time of the First Crusade, the presence of Crusaders in the Sinai until 1270 spurred the interest of European Christians and increased the number of intrepid pilgrims who visited the monastery.
The exact administrative status of the church within the Eastern Orthodox Church is ambiguous: by some, including the church itself, it is considered autocephalous, by others an autonomous church under the jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem.
But in 2003 Russian scholars discovered the donation act for the manuscript signed by the Council of Cairo Metochion and Archbishop Callistratus on 13 November 1869.
Palimpsests are notable for having been reused one or more times over the centuries.
Each page took approximately eight minutes to scan completely.
The large icon collection begins with a few dating to the 5th (possibly) and 6th centuries, which are unique survivals; the monastery having been untouched by Byzantine iconoclasm, and never sacked.
The conservation of its architectural structures, paintings, and books comprise much of the Foundation's purpose.
Its size reflects the relative prosperity of the time.
It was built on the site of an earlier, smaller temple also dedicated to Horus, although the previous structure was oriented east-west rather than north-south as in the present site.
The temple of Edfu fell into disuse as a religious monument following Theodosius I's persecution of pagans and edict banning non-Christian worship within the Roman Empire in 391.
Over the centuries, the temple became buried to a depth of 12 metres (39 ft) beneath drifting desert sand and layers of river silt deposited by the Nile.
In 1860 Auguste Mariette, a French Egyptologist, began the work of freeing Edfu temple from the sands.
Great Zimbabwe is a medieval city in the south-eastern hills of Zimbabwe near Lake Mutirikwe and the town of Masvingo.
Great Zimbabwe is believed to have served as a royal palace for the local monarch.
They were constructed without mortar (dry stone).
The first confirmed visits by Europeans were in the late 19th century, with investigations of the site starting in 1871.
The Great Zimbabwe area was settled by the 4th century AD.
David Beach believes that the city and its state, the Kingdom of Zimbabwe, flourished from 1200 to 1500, although a somewhat earlier date for its demise is implied by a description transmitted in the early 1500s to João de Barros.
They are known as the Hill Complex, the Valley Complex and the Great Enclosure.
The focus of power moved from the Hill Complex in the 12th century, to the Great Enclosure, the Upper Valley and finally the Lower Valley in the early 16th century.
Other artefacts include soapstone figurines (one of which is in the British Museum), pottery, iron gongs, elaborately worked ivory, iron and copper wire, iron hoes, bronze spearheads, copper ingots and crucibles, and gold beads, bracelets, pendants and sheaths.
That international commerce was in addition to the local agricultural trade, in which cattle were especially important.
Portuguese traders heard about the remains of the medieval city in the early 16th century, and records survive of interviews and notes made by some of them, linking Great Zimbabwe to gold production and long-distance trade.
He asserted that the figurine instead appeared to date to the subsequent Ptolemaic era (c. 323–30 BC), when Alexandria-based Greek merchants would export Egyptian antiquities and pseudo-antiquities to southern Africa.
Bent had no formal archaeological training, but had travelled very widely in Arabia, Greece and Asia Minor.
They have a tradition of ancient Jewish or South Arabian descent through their male line.
The Lemba claim was also reported by a William Bolts (in 1777, to the Austrian Habsburg authorities), and by an A.A. Anderson (writing about his travels north of the Limpopo River in the 19th century).
She had first sunk three test pits into what had been refuse heaps on the upper terraces of the hill complex, producing a mix of unremarkable pottery and ironwork.
Caton Thompson immediately announced her Bantu origin theory to a meeting of the British Association in Johannesburg.
The radiocarbon evidence is a suite of 28 measurements, for which all but the first four, from the early days of the use of that method and now viewed as inaccurate, support the 12th-to-15th-centuries chronology.
The removal of gold and artefacts in amateurist diggings by early colonial antiquarians caused widespread damage, notably diggings by Richard Nicklin Hall.
Preben Kaarsholm writes that both colonial and black nationalist groups invoked Great Zimbabwe's past to support their vision of the country's present, through the media of popular history and of fiction.
Pikirayi and Kaarsholm suggest that this presentation of Great Zimbabwe was partly intended to encourage settlement and investment in the area.
In 1980 the new internationally recognised independent country was renamed for the site, and its famous soapstone bird carvings were retained from the Rhodesian flag and Coat of Arms as a national symbol and depicted in the new Zimbabwean flag.
An example of the former is Ken Mufuka's booklet, although the work has been heavily criticised.
It was created to preserve the rich history of this country which was facing a dark future due to globalisation.
The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands.
The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.
One possible translation for Itza is "enchanter (or enchantment) of the water," from its (itz), "sorcerer", and ha, "water".
This form preserves the phonemic distinction between chʼ and ch, since the base word chʼeʼen (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant.
Of these cenotes, the "Cenote Sagrado" or Sacred Cenote (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous.
Instead, the city's political organization could have been structured by a "multepal" system, which is characterized as rulership through council composed of members of elite ruling lineages.
It was, however, toward the end of the Late Classic and into the early part of the Terminal Classic that the site became a major regional capital, centralizing and dominating political, sociocultural, economic, and ideological life in the northern Maya lowlands.
Hunac Ceel supposedly prophesied his own rise to power.
While there is some archeological evidence that indicates Chichén Itzá was at one time looted and sacked, there appears to be greater evidence that it could not have been by Mayapan, at least not when Chichén Itzá was an active urban center.
After Chichén Itzá elite activities ceased, the city may not have been abandoned.
Montejo returned to Yucatán in 1531 with reinforcements and established his main base at Campeche on the west coast.
Montejo the Younger eventually arrived at Chichen Itza, which he renamed Ciudad Real.
Months passed, but no reinforcements arrived.
By 1535, all Spanish had been driven from the Yucatán Peninsula.
In 1860, Désiré Charnay surveyed Chichén Itzá and took numerous photographs that he published in Cités et ruines américaines (1863).
Augustus Le Plongeon called it "Chaacmol" (later renamed "Chac Mool", which has been the term to describe all types of this statuary found in Mesoamerica).
In 1894 the United States Consul to Yucatán, Edward Herbert Thompson, purchased the Hacienda Chichén, which included the ruins of Chichen Itza.
Thompson is most famous for dredging the Cenote Sagrado (Sacred Cenote) from 1904 to 1910, where he recovered artifacts of gold, copper and carved jade, as well as the first-ever examples of what were believed to be pre-Columbian Maya cloth and wooden weapons.
The Mexican Revolution and the following government instability, as well as World War I, delayed the project by a decade.
At the same time, the Mexican government excavated and restored El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcán) and the Great Ball Court.
Thompson, who was in the United States at the time, never returned to Yucatán.
In 1944 the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Thompson had broken no laws and returned Chichen Itza to his heirs.
The first was sponsored by the National Geographic, and the second by private interests.
The city was built upon broken terrain, which was artificially levelled in order to build the major architectural groups, with the greatest effort being expended in the levelling of the areas for the Castillo pyramid, and the Las Monjas, Osario and Main Southwest groups.
Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple colors.
Just like gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.
The Puuc-style building feature the usual mosaic-decorated upper façades characteristic of the style but differ from the architecture of the Puuc heartland in their block masonry walls, as opposed to the fine veneers of the Puuc region proper.
At the base of the balustrades of the northeastern staircase are carved heads of a serpent.
After several false starts, they discovered a staircase under the north side of the pyramid.
The Mexican government excavated a tunnel from the base of the north staircase, up the earlier pyramid's stairway to the hidden temple, and opened it to tourists.
In one panel, one of the players has been decapitated; the wound emits streams of blood in the form of wriggling snakes.
At the south end is another, much bigger temple, but in ruins.
Inside there is a large mural, much destroyed, which depicts a battle scene.
It is built in a combination Maya and Toltec styles, with a staircase ascending each of its four sides.
In its interior archeologists discovered a collection of large cones carved out of stone, the purpose of which is unknown.
Its name comes from a series of altars at the top of the structure that are supported by small carved figures of men with upraised arms, called "atlantes."
This complex is analogous to Temple B at the Toltec capital of Tula, and indicates some form of cultural contact between the two regions.
This temple encases or entombs a former structure called The Temple of the Chac Mool.
To the south of the Group of a Thousand Columns is a group of three, smaller, interconnected buildings.
A section of the upper façade with a motif of x's and o's is displayed in front of the structure.
The Temple of Xtoloc is a recently restored temple outside the Osario Platform is.
Between the Xtoloc temple and the Osario are several aligned structures: The Platform of Venus, which is similar in design to the structure of the same name next to Kukulkan (El Castillo), the Platform of the Tombs, and a small, round structure that is unnamed.
The Casa Colorada (Spanish for "Red House") is one of the best preserved buildings at Chichen Itza.
In 2009, INAH restored a small ball court that adjoined the back wall of the Casa Colorada.
This building's name has been long used by the local Maya, and some authors mention that it was named after a deer painting over stucco that doesn't exist anymore.
The Spanish named this complex Las Monjas ("The Nuns" or "The Nunnery"), but it was a governmental palace.
These texts frequently mention a ruler by the name of Kʼakʼupakal.
It gets its name from the stone spiral staircase inside.
The long, western-facing façade has seven doorways.
The southern end of the building has one entrance.
Inside one of the chambers, near the ceiling, is a painted hand print.
The location of the cave has been well known in modern times.
E. Wyllys Andrews IV also explored the cave in the 1930s.
On 15 September 1959, José Humberto Gómez, a local guide, discovered a false wall in the cave.
Even before the book was published, Benjamin Norman and Baron Emanuel von Friedrichsthal traveled to Chichen after meeting Stephens, and both published the results of what they found.
In 1923, Governor Carrillo Puerto officially opened the highway to Chichen Itza.
In 1930, the Mayaland Hotel opened, just north of the Hacienda Chichén, which had been taken over by the Carnegie Institution.
In 1972, Mexico enacted the Ley Federal Sobre Monumentos y Zonas Arqueológicas, Artísticas e Históricas (Federal Law over Monuments and Archeological, Artistic and Historic Sites) that put all the nation's pre-Columbian monuments, including those at Chichen Itza, under federal ownership.
Tour guides will also demonstrate a unique the acoustical effect at Chichen Itza: a handclap before the in front of the staircase the El Castillo pyramid will produce by an echo that resembles the chirp of a bird, similar to that of the quetzal as investigated by Declercq.
INAH, which manages the site, has closed a number of monuments to public access.
Originally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the building was constructed by Walter Chrysler, the head of the Chrysler Corporation.
An annex was completed in 1952, and the building was sold by the Chrysler family the next year, with numerous subsequent owners.
The era was characterized by profound social and technological changes.
The following year, Chrysler was named Time magazine's "Person of the Year".
Following the end of World War I, European and American architects came to see simplified design as the epitome of the modern era and Art Deco skyscrapers as symbolizing progress, innovation, and modernity.
Prior to his involvement in planning the building, Reynolds was best known for developing Coney Island's Dreamland amusement park.
In 1927, after several years of delays, Reynolds hired the architect William Van Alen to design a forty-story building there.
Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson who handled the firm's finances.
The proposal was changed again two weeks later, with official plans for a 63-story building.
The adjacent 56-story Chanin Building was also under construction.
These plans were approved in June 1928.
He instead devised an alternate design for the Reynolds Building, which was published in August 1928.
A contract was awarded on October 28, and demolition was completed on November 9.
From late 1928 to early 1929, modifications to the design of the dome continued.
Lower down, the design was affected by Walter Chrysler's intention to make the building the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters, and as such, various architectural details were modeled after Chrysler automobile products, such as the hood ornaments of the Plymouth (see ).
Construction of the building proper began on January 21, 1929.
Despite a frantic steelwork construction pace of about four floors per week, no workers died during the construction of the skyscraper's steelwork.
40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building started competing for the distinction of "world's tallest building".
On October 23, 1929, one week after surpassing the Woolworth Building's height and one day before the catastrophic Wall Street Crash of 1929 started, the spire was assembled.
Even the New York Herald Tribune, which had virtually continuous coverage of the tower's construction, did not report on the spire's installation until days after the spire had been raised.
In the lobby of the building, a bronze plaque that read "in recognition of Mr. Chrysler's contribution to civic advancement" was unveiled.
The Chrysler Building was appraised at $14 million, but was exempt from city taxes per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union.
Van Alen's satisfaction at these accomplishments was likely muted by Walter Chrysler's later refusal to pay the balance of his architectural fee.
However, the lawsuit against Chrysler markedly diminished Van Alen's reputation as an architect, which, along with the effects of the Great Depression and negative criticism, ended up ruining his career.
In 1944, the corporation filed plans to build a 38-story annex to the east of the building, at 666 Third Avenue.
The stone for the original building was no longer manufactured, and had to be specially replicated.
The family sold the building in 1953 to William Zeckendorf for its assessed price of $18 million.
At the time, it was reported to be the largest real estate sale in New York City's history.
In 1961, the building's stainless steel elements, including the needle, crown, gargoyles, and entrance doors, were polished for the first time.
The company purchased the building for $35 million.
The spire underwent a restoration that was completed in 1995.
The cleaning received the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award for 1997.
In June 2008, it was reported that the Abu Dhabi Investment Council was in negotiations to buy TMW's 75% economic interest, a 15% interest from Tishman Speyer Properties in the building, and a share of the Trylons retail structure next door for US$800 million.
This resulted in a 21% decrease in the building's total energy consumption, a 64% decrease in water consumption, and an 81% rate of waste being recycled.
The Ethics of Philosophical Practice."
Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value).
Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole.
In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize.
In Against the Logicians the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus detailed the variety of ways in which the ancient Greek philosophers had divided philosophy, noting that this three-part division was agreed to by Plato, Aristotle, Xenocrates, and the Stoics.
Other ancient philosophical traditions influenced by Socrates included Cynicism, Cyrenaicism, Stoicism, and Academic Skepticism.
Some key Medieval thinkers include St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Anselm and Roger Bacon.
Major modern philosophers include Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant.
Babylonian astronomy also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the Ancient Greeks.
Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of Moses Mendelssohn who ushered in the Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment), Jewish existentialism, and Reform Judaism.
Islamic philosophy is the philosophical work originating in the Islamic tradition and is mostly done in Arabic.
Early Islamic philosophy developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions.
The work of Aristotle was very influential among philosophers such as Al-Kindi (9th century), Avicenna (980 – June 1037) and Averroes (12th century).
Ibn Khaldun was an influential thinker in philosophy of history.
Indian philosophical traditions share various key concepts and ideas, which are defined in different ways and accepted or rejected by the different traditions.
Indian philosophy is commonly grouped based on their relationship to the Vedas and the ideas contained in them.
The schools which align themselves with the thought of the Upanishads, the so-called "orthodox" or "Hindu" traditions, are often classified into six darśanas or philosophies:Sānkhya, Yoga, Nyāya, Vaisheshika, Mimāmsā and Vedānta.
They also reflect a tolerance for a diversity of philosophical interpretations within Hinduism while sharing the same foundation.
There are also other schools of thought which are often seen as "Hindu", though not necessarily orthodox (since they may accept different scriptures as normative, such as the Shaiva Agamas and Tantras), these include different schools of Shavism such as Pashupata, Shaiva Siddhanta, non-dual tantric Shavism (i.e. Trika, Kaula, etc.).
The denial that a human being possesses a "self" or "soul" is probably the most famous Buddhist teaching.
Jain philosophy is one of the only two surviving "unorthodox" traditions (along with Buddhism).
Jain thought holds that all existence is cyclic, eternal and uncreated.
In these regions, Buddhist thought developed into different philosophical traditions which used various languages (like Tibetan, Chinese and Pali).
The philosophy of the Theravada school is dominant in Southeast Asian countries like Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand.
After the death of the Buddha, various groups began to systematize his main teachings, eventually developing comprehensive philosophical systems termed Abhidharma.
There were numerous schools, sub-schools, and traditions of Buddhist philosophy in ancient and medieval India.
These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such Tao, Yin and yang, Ren and Li.
Neo-Confucianism came to dominate the education system during the Song dynasty (960–1297), and its ideas served as the philosophical basis of the imperial exams for the scholar official class.
During later Chinese dynasties like the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean Joseon dynasty (1392–1897) a resurgent Neo-Confucianism led by thinkers such as Wang Yangming (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought, and was promoted by the imperial state.
In the Modern era, Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophy.
For example, New Confucianism, led by figures such as Xiong Shili, has become quite influential.
Another trend in modern Japanese philosophy was the "National Studies" (Kokugaku) tradition.
During the 17th century, Ethiopian philosophy developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by Zera Yacob.
Another feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants.
The theory of Teotl can be seen as a form of Pantheism.
Nevertheless, U.S. Department of Education reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy, and that philosophy is one of the least gender-proportionate fields in the humanities, with women making up somewhere between 17% and 30% of philosophy faculty according to some studies.
See also "Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities."
Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of morality.
Epistemologists examine putative sources of knowledge, including perceptual experience, reason, memory, and testimony.
It arose early in Pre-Socratic philosophy and became formalized with Pyrrho, the founder of the earliest Western school of philosophical skepticism.
Empiricism places emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge.
Rationalism is associated with a priori knowledge, which is independent of experience (such as logic and mathematics).
Metaphysics includes cosmology, the study of the world in its entirety and ontology, the study of being.
Essence is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while accident is a property that the object has, without which the object can still retain its identity.
Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences, social sciences and humanities disciplines, logic became a formal science.
New York: Oxford University Press.
However, most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law, journalism, religion, sciences, politics, business, or various arts.
In analytic philosophy, philosophy of language investigates the nature of language, the relations between language, language users, and the world.
These writers were followed by Ludwig Wittgenstein (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus), the Vienna Circle as well as the logical positivists, and Willard Van Orman Quine.
He criticized conventionalism because it led to the bizarre consequence that anything can be conventionally denominated by any name.
To do this, he pointed out that compound words and phrases have a range of correctness.
However, by the end of the Cratylus, he had admitted that some social conventions were also involved, and that there were faults in the idea that phonemes had individual meanings.
He separated all things into categories of species and genus.
However, since Aristotle took these similarities to be constituted by a real commonality of form, he is more often considered a proponent of "moderate realism".
This lektón was the meaning (or sense) of every term.
There were several noteworthy philosophers of language in the medieval period.
The scholastics of the high medieval period, such as Ockham and John Duns Scotus, considered logic to be a scientia sermocinalis (science of language).
The phenomena of vagueness and ambiguity were analyzed intensely, and this led to an increasing interest in problems related to the use of syncategorematic words such as and, or, not, if, and every.
The suppositio of a term is the interpretation that is given of it in a specific context.
Such a classification scheme is the precursor of modern distinctions between use and mention, and between language and metalanguage.
One part of the common sentence is the lexical word, which is composed of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
Philosophical semantics tends to focus on the principle of compositionality to explain the relationship between meaningful parts and whole sentences.
It is possible to use the concept of functions to describe more than just how lexical meanings work: they can also be used to describe the meaning of a sentence.
A propositional function is an operation of language that takes an entity (in this case, the horse) as an input and outputs a semantic fact (i.e., the proposition that is represented by "The horse is red").
Is language acquisition a special faculty in the mind?
The first is the behaviorist perspective, which dictates that not only is the solid bulk of language learned, but it is learned via conditioning.
Nativist models assert that there are specialized devices in the brain that are dedicated to language acquisition.
Linguists Sapir and Whorf suggested that language limited the extent to which members of a "linguistic community" can think about certain subjects (a hypothesis paralleled in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four).
The stark opposite to the Sapir–Whorf position is the notion that thought (or, more broadly, mental content) has priority over language.
Another argument is that it is difficult to explain how signs and symbols on paper can represent anything meaningful unless some sort of meaning is infused into them by the contents of the mind.
Another tradition of philosophers has attempted to show that language and thought are coextensive – that there is no way of explaining one without the other.
To an extent, the theoretical underpinnings to cognitive semantics (including the notion of semantic framing) suggest the influence of language upon thought.
There are studies that prove that languages shape how people understand causality.
However, Spanish or Japanese speakers would be more likely to say "the vase broke itself".
Spanish and Japanese speakers did not remember the agents of accidental events as well as did English speakers.
In one study German and Spanish speakers were asked to describe objects having opposite gender assignment in those two languages.
To describe a "bridge", which is feminine in German and masculine in Spanish, the German speakers said "beautiful", "elegant", "fragile", "peaceful", "pretty" and "slender", and the Spanish speakers said "big", "dangerous", "long", "strong", "sturdy" and "towering".
Whether each alien was friendly or hostile was determined by certain subtle features but participants were not told what these were.
For the rest, the aliens remained nameless.
It was concluded that naming objects helps us categorize and memorize them.
Within this area, issues include: the nature of synonymy, the origins of meaning itself, our apprehension of meaning, and the nature of composition (the question of how meaningful units of language are composed of smaller meaningful parts, and how the meaning of the whole is derived from the meaning of its parts).
The ideational theory of meaning, most commonly associated with the British empiricist John Locke, claims that meanings are mental representations provoked by signs.
(See also Wittgenstein's picture theory of language.)
Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.
The reference theory of meaning, also known collectively as semantic externalism, views meaning to be equivalent to those things in the world that are actually connected to signs.
The traditional formulation of such a theory is that the meaning of a sentence is its method of verification or falsification.
In this version, the comprehension (and hence meaning) of a sentence consists in the hearer's ability to recognize the demonstration (mathematical, empirical or other) of the truth of the sentence.
A pragmatic theory of meaning is any theory in which the meaning (or understanding) of a sentence is determined by the consequences of its application.
Gottlob Frege was an advocate of a mediated reference theory.
Such a thought is abstract, universal and objective.
Referents are the objects in the world that words pick out.
He viewed proper names of the sort described above as "abbreviated definite descriptions" (see Theory of descriptions).
Such phrases denote in the sense that there is an object that satisfies the description.
On Frege's account, any referring expression has a sense as well as a referent.
Despite the differences between the views of Frege and Russell, they are generally lumped together as descriptivists about proper names.
Consider the name Aristotle and the descriptions "the greatest student of Plato", "the founder of logic" and "the teacher of Alexander".
He may have existed and not have become known to posterity at all or he may have died in infancy.
But this is deeply counterintuitive.
Questions inevitably arise on surrounding topics.
David Kellogg Lewis proposed a worthy reply to the first question by expounding the view that a convention is a rationally self-perpetuating regularity in behavior.
Noam Chomsky proposed that the study of language could be done in terms of the I-Language, or internal language of persons.
One fruitful source of research involves investigation into the social conditions that give rise to, or are associated with, meanings and languages.
The presumptions that prop up each theoretical view are of interest to the philosopher of language.
Rhetoric is the study of the particular words that people use to achieve the proper emotional and rational effect in the listener, be it to persuade, provoke, endear, or teach.
It also has applications to the study and interpretation of law, and helps give insight to the logical concept of the domain of discourse.
The idea of language is often related to that of logic in its Greek sense as "logos", meaning discourse or dialectic.
Heidegger combines phenomenology with the hermeneutics of Wilhelm Dilthey.
For example, Sein (being), the word itself, is saturated with multiple meanings.
Heidegger claims writing is only a supplement to speech, because even readers construct or contribute their own "talk" while reading.
In Truth and Method, Gadamer describes language as "the medium in which substantive understanding and agreement take place between two people.
Paul Ricœur, on the other hand, proposed a hermeneutics which, reconnecting with the original Greek sense of the term, emphasized the discovery of hidden meanings in the equivocal terms (or "symbols") of ordinary language.
It allows them to take advantage of and effectively manipulate the external world in order to create meaning for themselves and transmit this meaning to others.
Some important figures in the history of semiotics, are Charles Sanders Peirce, Roland Barthes, and Roman Jakobson.
19th century romanticism emphasised human agency and free will in meaning construction.
Humanistic views are challenged by biological theories of language which consider languages as natural phenomena.
In Neo-Darwinism, Richard Dawkins and other proponents of cultural replicator theories consider languages as populations of mind viruses.
Some have said that the expression stands for some real, abstract universal out in the world called "rocks".
The issue here can be explicated if we examine the proposition "Socrates is a Man".
These two things connect in some way or overlap.
Another perspective is to consider "man" to be a property of the entity, "Socrates".
Some of the most prominent members of this tradition of formal semantics include Tarski, Carnap, Richard Montague and Donald Davidson.
They did not believe that the social and practical dimensions of linguistic meaning could be captured by any attempts at formalization using the tools of logic.
Many of its ideas have been absorbed by theorists such as Kent Bach, Robert Brandom, Paul Horwich and Stephen Neale.
In Word and Object, Quine asks readers to imagine a situation in which they are confronted with a previously undocumented, group of indigenous people where they must attempt to make sense of the utterances and gestures that its members make.
All that can be done is to examine the utterance as a part of the overall linguistic behaviour of the individual, and then use these observations to interpret the meaning of all other utterances.
For Quine, as for Wittgenstein and Austin, meaning is not something that is associated with a single word or sentence, but is rather something that, if it can be attributed at all, can only be attributed to a whole language.
The specific instances of vagueness that most interest philosophers of language are those where the existence of "borderline cases" makes it seemingly impossible to say whether a predicate is true or false.
The philosophy of mathematics is the branch of philosophy that studies the assumptions, foundations, and implications of mathematics.
Today, some philosophers of mathematics aim to give accounts of this form of inquiry and its products as they stand, while others emphasize a role for themselves that goes beyond simple interpretation to critical analysis.
Greek philosophy on mathematics was strongly influenced by their study of geometry.
Therefore, 3, for example, represented a certain multitude of units, and was thus not "truly" a number.
These earlier Greek ideas of numbers were later upended by the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of two.
According to legend, fellow Pythagoreans were so traumatized by this discovery that they murdered Hippasus to stop him from spreading his heretical idea.
It is a profound puzzle that on the one hand mathematical truths seem to have a compelling inevitability, but on the other hand the source of their "truthfulness" remains elusive.
Three schools, formalism, intuitionism, and logicism, emerged at this time, partly in response to the increasingly widespread worry that mathematics as it stood, and analysis in particular, did not live up to the standards of certainty and rigor that had been taken for granted.
As the century unfolded, the initial focus of concern expanded to an open exploration of the fundamental axioms of mathematics, the axiomatic approach having been taken for granted since the time of Euclid around 300 BCE as the natural basis for mathematics.
In mathematics, as in physics, new and unexpected ideas had arisen and significant changes were coming.
I do not think that the difficulties that philosophy finds with classical mathematics today are genuine difficulties; and I think that the philosophical interpretations of mathematics that we are being offered on every hand are wrong, and that "philosophical interpretation" is just what mathematics doesn't need.
Many working mathematicians have been mathematical realists; they see themselves as discoverers of naturally occurring objects.
Certain principles (e.g., for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but the continuum hypothesis conjecture might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles.
Both Plato's cave and Platonism have meaningful, not just superficial connections, because Plato's ideas were preceded and probably influenced by the hugely popular Pythagoreans of ancient Greece, who believed that the world was, quite literally, generated by numbers.
This view bears resemblances to many things Husserl said about mathematics, and supports Kant's idea that mathematics is synthetic a priori.)
Full-blooded Platonism is a modern variation of Platonism, which is in reaction to the fact that different sets of mathematical entities can be proven to exist depending on the axioms and inference rules employed (for instance, the law of the excluded middle, and the axiom of choice).
Set-theoretic realism (also set-theoretic Platonism) a position defended by Penelope Maddy, is the view that set theory is about a single universe of sets.
They attributed the paradox to "vicious circularity" and built up what they called ramified type theory to deal with it.
Even Russell said that this axiom did not really belong to logic.
Frege required Basic Law V to be able to give an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume's principle.
But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in his or her work and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist.
Hilbert aimed to show the consistency of mathematical systems from the assumption that the "finitary arithmetic" (a subsystem of the usual arithmetic of the positive integers, chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent.
Thus, in order to show that any axiomatic system of mathematics is in fact consistent, one needs to first assume the consistency of a system of mathematics that is in a sense stronger than the system to be proven consistent.
Other formalists, such as Rudolf Carnap, Alfred Tarski, and Haskell Curry, considered mathematics to be the investigation of formal axiom systems.
The more games we study, the better.
The main critique of formalism is that the actual mathematical ideas that occupy mathematicians are far removed from the string manipulation games mentioned above.
Brouwer, the founder of the movement, held that mathematical objects arise from the a priori forms of the volitions that inform the perception of empirical objects.
The axiom of choice is also rejected in most intuitionistic set theories, though in some versions it is accepted.
In this view, mathematics is an exercise of the human intuition, not a game played with meaningless symbols.
Likewise all the other whole numbers are defined by their places in a structure, the number line.
However, its central claim only relates to what kind of entity a mathematical object is, not to what kind of existence mathematical objects or structures have (not, in other words, to their ontology).
Structures are held to have a real but abstract and immaterial existence.
Structures are held to exist inasmuch as some concrete system exemplifies them.
Like nominalism, the post rem approach denies the existence of abstract mathematical objects with properties other than their place in a relational structure.
It is held that mathematics is not universal and does not exist in any real sense, other than in human brains.
However, the human mind has no special claim on reality or approaches to it built out of math.
The most accessible, famous, and infamous treatment of this perspective is Where Mathematics Comes From, by George Lakoff and Rafael E. Núñez.
Franklin, James (2014), "An Aristotelian Realist Philosophy of Mathematics", Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke; Franklin, James (2021), "Mathematics as a science of non-abstract reality: Aristotelian realist philosophies of mathematics," Foundations of Science 25.
The Euclidean arithmetic developed by John Penn Mayberry in his book The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets also falls into the Aristotelian realist tradition.
Edmund Husserl, in the first volume of his Logical Investigations, called "The Prolegomena of Pure Logic", criticized psychologism thoroughly and sought to distance himself from it.
That is, since physics needs to talk about electrons to say why light bulbs behave as they do, then electrons must exist.
It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.
This grew from the increasingly popular assertion in the late 20th century that no one foundation of mathematics could be ever proven to exist.
A mathematical argument can transmit falsity from the conclusion to the premises just as well as it can transmit truth from the premises to the conclusion.
He gave a detailed argument for this in New Directions.
If mathematics is just as empirical as the other sciences, then this suggests that its results are just as fallible as theirs, and just as contingent.
For a philosophy of mathematics that attempts to overcome some of the shortcomings of Quine and Gödel's approaches by taking aspects of each see Penelope Maddy's Realism in Mathematics.
He started with the "betweenness" of Hilbert's axioms to characterize space without coordinatizing it, and then added extra relations between points to do the work formerly done by vector fields.
By this account, there are no metaphysical or epistemological problems special to mathematics.
However, while on an empiricist view the evaluation is some sort of comparison with "reality", social constructivists emphasize that the direction of mathematical research is dictated by the fashions of the social group performing it or by the needs of the society financing it.
But social constructivists argue that mathematics is in fact grounded by much uncertainty: as mathematical practice evolves, the status of previous mathematics is cast into doubt, and is corrected to the degree it is required or desired by the current mathematical community.
The social nature of mathematics is highlighted in its subcultures.
Social constructivists see the process of "doing mathematics" as actually creating the meaning, while social realists see a deficiency either of human capacity to abstractify, or of human's cognitive bias, or of mathematicians' collective intelligence as preventing the comprehension of a real universe of mathematical objects.
More recently Paul Ernest has explicitly formulated a social constructivist philosophy of mathematics.
For example, the tools of linguistics are not generally applied to the symbol systems of mathematics, that is, mathematics is studied in a markedly different way from other languages.
However, the methods developed by Frege and Tarski for the study of mathematical language have been extended greatly by Tarski's student Richard Montague and other linguists working in formal semantics to show that the distinction between mathematical language and natural language may not be as great as it seems.
The assertion that "all" entities postulated in scientific theories, including numbers, should be accepted as real is justified by confirmation holism.
Field developed his views into fictionalism.
The argument hinges on the idea that a satisfactory naturalistic account of thought processes in terms of brain processes can be given for mathematical reasoning along with everything else.
Another line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non-causal, and not analogous to perception.
By way of example, they provide two proofs of the irrationality of .
Paul Erdős was well known for his notion of a hypothetical "Book" containing the most elegant or beautiful mathematical proofs.
By the same token, however, philosophers of mathematics have sought to characterize what makes one proof more desirable than another when both are logically sound.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the ontology and nature of the mind and its relationship with the body.
Dualism and monism are the two central schools of thought on the mind–body problem, although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other category neatly.

Secondly, intentional states of consciousness do not make sense on non-reductive physicalism.
Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants.
Robinson, H. (1983): "Aristotelian dualism", Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 1, 123–44.
They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding the idea that there is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic or unintelligible.
So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person.
There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical.
Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality.
Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent.
The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body.
Others such as Dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent, or unlikely, concept.
It is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states.
Descartes' argument depends on the premise that what Seth believes to be "clear and distinct" ideas in his mind are necessarily true.
Cambridge, MA: MIT Press (Bradford) For example, Joseph Agassi suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas.
This view was most prominently defended by Gottfried Leibniz.
These emergent properties have an independent ontological status and cannot be reduced to, or explained in terms of, the physical substrate from which they emerge.
Epiphenomenalism is a doctrine first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley.
This view has been defended by Frank Jackson.
Panpsychism is the view that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view.
An example of these disparate degrees of freedom is given by Allan Wallace who notes that it is "experientially apparent that one may be physically uncomfortable—for instance, while engaging in a strenuous physical workout—while mentally cheerful; conversely, one may be mentally distraught while experiencing physical comfort".
Mental states can cause changes in physical states and vice versa.
Experiential dualism is accepted as the conceptual framework of Madhyamaka Buddhism.
In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science.
Indeed, physicalism, or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality, is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.
While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena.
The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia.
Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science.
Although pure idealism, such as that of George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.
A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental.
Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations.
Parallel to these developments in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed.
These philosophers reasoned that, if mental states are something material, but not behavioral, then mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain.
According to token identity theories, the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state.
Finally, Wittgenstein's idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by Wilfrid Sellars and Gilbert Harman.
Hence, the question arises whether there can still be a non-reductive physicalism.
Davidson uses the thesis of supervenience: mental states supervene on physical states, but are not reducible to them. "
The brain goes on from one moment of time to another; the brain thus has identity through time.
An analogy of the self or the “I” would be the flame of a candle.
The flame displays a type of continuity in that the candle does not go out while it is burning, but there is not really any identity of the flame from one moment to another over time.
Similarly, it is an illusion that one is the same individual who walked into class this morning.
This is analogous to physical properties of the brain giving rise to a mental state.
The Churchlands often invoke the fate of other, erroneous popular theories and ontologies that have arisen in the course of history.
Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion.
Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary.
The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.
And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts.
The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences.
This follows from an assumption about the possibility of reductive explanations.
The 20th-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger criticized the ontological assumptions underpinning such a reductive model, and claimed that it was impossible to make sense of experience in these terms.
This problem of explaining introspective first-person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general in terms of third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the explanatory gap.
There are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other.
For Nagel, science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required.
This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values.
But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes?
If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false.
Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings play an important role in the philosophy of mind.
Within the field of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are concerned with the relations between mental and physical states and processes: Sensory neurophysiology investigates the relation between the processes of perception and stimulation.
Lastly, evolutionary biology studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, in as much as this is the basis of the mind, also describes the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages.
A simple example is multiplication.
This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
The objective of strong AI, on the contrary, is a computer with consciousness similar to that of human beings.
The Turing test has received many criticisms, among which the most famous is probably the Chinese room thought experiment formulated by Searle.
Psychology investigates the laws that bind these mental states to each other or with inputs and outputs to the human organism.
A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other.
It includes research on intelligence and behavior, especially focusing on how information is represented, processed, and transformed (in faculties such as perception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion) within nervous systems (human or other animal) and machines (e.g. computers).
Nonetheless, Hegel's work differs radically from the style of Anglo-American philosophy of mind.
Phenomenology, founded by Edmund Husserl, focuses on the contents of the human mind (see noema) and how processes shape our experiences.
This is the case for materialistic determinists.
Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do.
Those who adopt this position suggest that the question "Are we free?"
It is not appropriate to identify freedom with indetermination.
The most important compatibilist in the history of the philosophy was David Hume.
These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency, b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency.
They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance.
The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives from the idea of an immaterial soul.
Mantranga, the principal governing body of these states, consisted of the King, Prime Minister, Commander in chief of army, Chief Priest of the King.
The Arthashastra provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler, policies for foreign affairs and wars, the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state.
The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools.
Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws.
By the late ancient period, however, the "traditionalist" Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed.
However, in Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: al-Kindi (Alkindus), al-Farabi (Abunaser), İbn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes).
For example, the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah, or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought.
Aristotleanism flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the peripatetic philosophers who implemented the ideas of Aristotle in the context of the Islamic world.
Other notable political philosophers of the time include Nizam al-Mulk, a Persian scholar and vizier of the Seljuq Empire who composed the Siyasatnama, or the "Book of Government" in English.
Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. Thomas Aquinas who helped reintroduce Aristotle's works, which had only been transmitted to Catholic Europe through Muslim Spain, along with the commentaries of Averroes.
Others, like Nicole Oresme in his Livre de Politiques, categorically denied this right to overthrow an unjust ruler.
That work, as well as The Discourses, a rigorous analysis of classical antiquity, did much to influence modern political thought in the West.
At any rate, Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the acquisition and maintenance of absolute power.
These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be.
The term "government" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound.

The pre-Socratic era lasted about two centuries, during which the expanding Persian Achaemenid Empire was stretching to the west, while the Greeks were advancing in trade and sea routes, reaching Cyprus and Syria.

Another factor was the ease and frequency of intra-Greek travel, which led to the blending and comparison of ideas.

The democratic political system of independent poleis also contributed to the rise of philosophy.

The philosophers' ideas, were, to a certain extent, answers to questions that were subtly present in the work of Homer and Hesiod.

They are considered predecessors of the pre-Socratics since they seek to address the origin of the world and to organize traditional folklore and legends systematically.

The first pre-Socratic philosophers also traveled extensively to other lands, meaning that pre-Socratic thought had roots abroad as well as domestically.
The pre-Socratic philosophers shared the intuition that there was a single explanation that could explain both the plurality and the singularity of the whole – and that explanation would not be direct actions of the gods.
Many sought the material principle (arche) of things, and the method of their origin and disappearance.
In their effort to make sense of the cosmos they coined new terms and concepts such as rhythm, symmetry, analogy, deductionism, reductionism, mathematicazion of nature and others.
It could mean the beginning or origin with the undertone that there is an effect on the things to follow.
This may have been because of a lack of instruments, or because of a tendency to view the world as a unity, undeconstructable, so it would be impossible for an external eye to observe tiny fractions of nature under experimental control.
Systematic because they tried to universalize their findings.
The pre-Socratics were not atheists; however, they minimized the extent of the gods' involvement in natural phenomena such as thunder or totally eliminated the gods from the natural world.
The first phase of pre-Socratic philosophy, mainly the Milesians, Xenophanes, and Heraclitus, consisted of rejecting traditional cosmogony and attempting to explain nature based on empirical observations and interpretations.
The Eleatics were also monists (believing that only one thing exists and everything else is just a transformation of it).
He is considered the first western philosopher since he was the first to use reason, to use proof, and to generalize.
Thales may have been of Phoenician ancestry.
Thales, though, advanced geometry with his abstract deductive reasoning reaching universal generalizations.
Thales visited Sardis, as many Greeks then, where astronomical records were kept and used astronomical observations for practical matters (oil harvesting).
He attributed the origin of the world to an element instead of a divine being.
He was a member of the elite of Miletus, wealthy and a statesman.
In response to Thales, he postulated as the first principle an undefined, unlimited substance without qualities (apeiron), out of which the primary opposites, hot and cold, moist and dry, became differentiated.
He is also known for speculating on the origin of mankind.
He also wrote a book on nature in prose.
He was a well-traveled poet whose primary interests were theology and epistemology.
He famously said that if oxen, horses, or lions could draw, they would draw their gods as oxen, horses, or lions.
Xenophanes also offered naturalistic explanations for phenomena such as the sun, the rainbow and St. Elmo's fire.
While Xenophanes was a pessimist about the capability of humans to reach knowledge, he also believed in gradual progress through critical thinking.
Heraclitus posited that all things in nature are in a state of perpetual flux.
Fire becomes water and earth and vice versa.
There, Heraclitus claims we can not step into the same river twice, a position summarized with the slogan ta panta rhei (everything flows).
Another key concept of Heraclitus is that opposites somehow mirror each other, a doctrine called unity of opposites.
Heraclitus' doctrine on the unity of opposites suggests that unity of the world and its various parts is kept through the tension produced by the opposites.
A fundamental idea in Heraclitus is logos, an ancient Greek word with a variety of meanings; Heraclitus might have used a different meaning of the word with each usage in his book.
Some decades later he had to flee Croton and relocate to Metapontum.
They advanced his ideas, reaching the claim that everything consists of numbers, the universe is made by numbers and everything is a reflection of analogies and geometrical relations.
Their way of life was ascetic, restraining themselves from various pleasures and food.
Other pre-Socratic philosophers mocked Pythagoras for his belief in reincarnation.
Pythagoreanism influenced later Christian currents as Neoplatonism, and its pedagogical methods were adapted by Plato.
According to Aristotle and Diogenes Laertius, Xenophanes was Parmenides' teacher, and it is debated whether Xenophanes should also be considered an Eleatic.
He was the first to deduce that the earth is spherical.
Parmenides wrote a hard to interpret poem, named On Nature or On What-is, that substantially influenced later Greek philosophy.
The poem consists of three parts, the proem (i.e., preface), the Way of Truth and the Way of Opinion.
The Way of Truth was then, and is still today, considered of much more importance.
Hence, all the things that we think to be true, even ourselves, are false representations.
The goddess teaches Kouros to use his reasoning to understand whether various claims are true or false, discarding senses as fallacious.
Zeno and Melissus continued Parmenides' thought on cosmology.
He tried to explain why we think various non-existent objects exist.
Anaxagoras was born in Ionia, but was the first major philosopher to emigrate to Athens.
Anaxagoras was also a major influence on Socrates.
Interpretations differ as to what he meant.
All objects were mixtures of various elements, such as air, water, and others.
Nous was also considered a building block of the cosmos, but it exists only in living objects.
Anaxagoras advanced Milesian thought on epistemology, striving to establish an explanation that could be valid for all natural phenomena.
According to Diogenes Laertius, Empedocles wrote two books in the form of poems: Peri Physeos (On nature) and the Katharmoi (Purifications).
He also continues Anaxagoras' thought on the four "roots" (i.e., classical elements), that by intermixing, they create all things around us.
These two forces are opposite and by acting upon the material of the four roots unite in harmony or tear apart the four roots, with the resulting mixture being all things that exist.
They are most famous for their atomic cosmology even though their thought included many other fields of philosophy, such as ethics, mathematics, aesthetics, politics, and even embryology.
Democritus and Leucippus were skeptics regarding the reliability of our senses, but they were confident that motion exists.
Atoms move within the void, interact with each other, and form the plurality of the world we live in, in a purely mechanical manner.
Democritus concluded that since everything is atoms and void, several of our senses are not real but conventional.
They attacked traditional thinking, from gods to morality, paving the way for further advances of philosophy and other disciplines such as drama, social sciences, mathematics, and history.
The sophists taught rhetoric and how to address issues from multiple viewpoints.
Gorgias wrote a book named On Nature, in which he attacked the Eleatics' concepts of What-is and What-is-not.
Antiphon placed natural law against the law of the city.
He attempted to explain both the variety and unity of the cosmos.
Diogenes of Apollonia returned to Milesian monism, but with a rather more elegant thought.
While Pythagoras and Empedocles linked their self-proclaimed wisdom to their divinely inspired status, they tried to teach or urge mortals to seek the truth about the natural realm—Pythagoras by means of mathematics and geometry and Empedocles by exposure to experiences.
They attacked the traditional representations of gods that Homer and Hesiod had established and put Greek popular religion under scrutiny, initiating the schism between natural philosophy and theology.
The theological thought starts with the Milesian philosophers.
Xenophanes set three preconditions for God: he had to be all good, immortal and not resembling humans in appearance, which had a major impact on western religious thought.
Anaxagoras asserted that cosmic intelligence (nous) gives life to things.
It was Hippocrates (often hailed as the father of medicine) who separated – but not completely – the two domains.
Ever-transforming nature is summarized by Heraclitus' axiom panta rhei (everything is in a state of flux).
The pre-Socratics sought to understand the various aspects of nature by means of rationalism, observations, and offering explanations that could be deemed as scientific, giving birth to what became Western rationalism.
Anaximander offered the principle of sufficient reason, a revolutionary argument that would also yield the principle that nothing comes out of nothing.
Xenophanes also advanced a critique of anthropomorphic religion by highlighting in a rational way the inconsistency of depictions of the gods in Greek popular religion.
Other pre-Socratics also sought to answer the question of arche, offering various answers, but the first step towards scientific thought was already taken.
The philosophic thought produced by the pre-Socratics heavily influenced later philosophers, historians and playwrights.
The naturalists impressed young Socrates and he was interested in the quest for the substance of the cosmos, but his interest waned as he became steadily more focused on epistemology, virtue, and ethics rather than the natural world.
Cicero analyzed his views on the pre-Socratics in his Tusculanae Disputationes, as he distinguished the theoretical nature of pre-Socratic thought from previous "sages" who were interested in more practical issues.
Aristotle discussed the pre-Socratics in the first book of Metaphysics, as an introduction to his own philosophy and the quest for arche.
Francis Bacon, a 16th-century philosopher known for advancing the scientific method, was probably the first philosopher of the modern era to use pre-Socratic axioms extensively in his texts.
Friedrich Nietzsche admired the pre-Socratics deeply, calling them "tyrants of the spirit" to mark their antithesis and his preference against Socrates and his successors.
According to his narrative, limned in many of his books, the pre-Socratic era was the glorious era of Greece, while the so-called Golden Age that followed was an age of decay, according to Nietzsche.
Even though this period – known in its earlier part as the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period – in its latter part was fraught with chaos and bloody battles, it is also known as the Golden Age of Chinese philosophy because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely.
Taoism (also called Daoism), a philosophy which emphasizes the Three Jewels of the Tao: compassion, moderation, and humility, while Taoist thought generally focuses on nature, the relationship between humanity and the cosmos; health and longevity; and wu wei (action through inaction).
Agrarianism, or the School of Agrarianism, which advocated peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism.
Scholars from this school were good orators, debaters and tacticians.
The School of "Minor-talks", which was not a unique school of thought, but a philosophy constructed of all the thoughts which were discussed by and originated from normal people on the street.
Thales inspired the Milesian school of philosophy and was followed by Anaximander, who argued that the substratum or arche could not be water or any of the classical elements but was instead something "unlimited" or "indefinite" (in Greek, the apeiron).
Contrary to the Milesian school, which posits one stable element as the arche, Heraclitus taught that panta rhei ("everything flows"), the closest element to this eternal flux being fire.
While philosophy was an established pursuit prior to Socrates, Cicero credits him as "the first who brought philosophy down from the heavens, placed it in cities, introduced it into families, and obliged it to examine into life and morals, and good and evil."
He criticizes the regimes described in Plato's Republic and Laws, and refers to the theory of forms as "empty words and poetic metaphors."
His ethics were based on "the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain".
Aquinas showed how it was possible to incorporate much of the philosophy of Aristotle without falling into the "errors" of the Commentator Averroes.
The designation "Renaissance philosophy" is used by scholars of intellectual history to refer to the thought of the period running in Europe roughly between 1355 and 1650 (the dates shift forward for central and northern Europe and for areas such as Spanish America, India, Japan, and China under European influence).
The assumption that Aristotle's works were foundational to an understanding of philosophy did not wane during the Renaissance, which saw a flourishing of new translations, commentaries, and other interpretations of his works, both in Latin and in the vernacular.
The latter, similar in some ways to modern debates, examined the pros and cons of particular philosophical positions or interpretations.
Plato, known directly only through two and a half dialogues in the Middle Ages, came to be known through numerous Latin translations in fifteenth century Italy, culminating in the hugely influential translation of his complete works by Marsilio Ficino in Florence in 1484.
Not all Renaissance humanists followed his example in all things, but Petrarch contributed to a broadening of his time's 'canon' (pagan poetry had previously been considered frivolous and dangerous), something that happened in philosophy as well.
Other movements from ancient philosophy also re-entered the mainstream.
This position came under increasing strain in the Renaissance, as various thinkers claimed that Thomas's classifications were inaccurate, and that ethics were the most important part of morality.
As we have seen, they believed that philosophy could be brought under the wing of rhetoric.
In 1416–1417, Leonardo Bruni, the pre-eminent humanist of his time and chancellor of Florence, re-translated Aristotle's Ethics into a more flowing, idiomatic and classical Latin.
The driving conviction was that philosophy should be freed of its technical jargon so that more people would be able to read it.
Desiderius Erasmus, the great Dutch humanist, even prepared a Greek edition of Aristotle, and eventually those teaching philosophy in the universities had to at least pretend that they knew Greek.
Once it had been determined, however, that Italian was a language with literary merit and that it could carry the weight of philosophical discussion, numerous efforts in this direction started to appear, particularly from the 1540s onward.
We know that debates about the freedom of the will continued to flare up (for instance, in the famous exchanges between Erasmus and Martin Luther), that Spanish thinkers were increasingly obsessed with the notion of nobility, that duelling was a practice that generated a large literature in the sixteenth century (was it permissible or not?).
We must not forget that most philosophers of the time were at least nominal, if not devout, Christians, that the sixteenth century saw both the Protestant and the Catholic reformations, and that Renaissance philosophy culminates with the period of the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648).
In conclusion, like any other moment in the history of thought Renaissance philosophy cannot be considered to have provided something entirely new nor to have continued for centuries to repeat the conclusions of its predecessors.
Modern philosophy is philosophy developed in the modern era and associated with modernity.
By the 17th and 18th centuries the major figures in philosophy of mind, epistemology, and metaphysics were roughly divided into two main groups.
The "Empiricists," by contrast, held that knowledge must begin with sensory experience.
Other important figures in political philosophy include Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
Kant sparked a storm of philosophical work in Germany in the early nineteenth century, beginning with German idealism.
Karl Marx appropriated both Hegel's philosophy of history and the empirical ethics dominant in Britain, transforming Hegel's ideas into a strictly materialist form, setting the grounds for the development of a science of society.
Arthur Schopenhauer took idealism to the conclusion that the world was nothing but the futile endless interplay of images and desires, and advocated atheism and pessimism.
Descartes argued that many predominant Scholastic metaphysical doctrines were meaningless or false.
He tries to set aside as much as he possibly can of all his beliefs, to determine what if anything he knows for certain.
From this basis he builds his knowledge back up again.
While historicism also acknowledges the role of experience, it differs from empiricism by assuming that sensory data cannot be understood without considering the historical and cultural circumstances in which observations are made.
As such empiricism is first and foremost characterized by the ideal to let observational data "speak for themselves", while the competing views are opposed to this ideal.
In other words: Empiricism as a concept has to be constructed along with other concepts, which together make it possible to make important discriminations between different ideals underlying contemporary science.
Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing.
It describes a process where theory is extracted from practice, and applied back to practice to form what is called intelligent practice.
Brian Leiter (2006) webpage “Analytic” and “Continental” Philosophy.
Contemporary philosophy is the present period in the history of Western philosophy beginning at the early 20th century with the increasing professionalization of the discipline and the rise of analytic and continental philosophy.
Germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy.
Furthermore, unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books, magazines, and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace, works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare.
Each division organises a large annual conference.
Among its many other tasks, the association is responsible for administering many of the profession's top honors.
This development was roughly contemporaneous with work by Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell inaugurating a new philosophical method based on the analysis of language via modern logic (hence the term "analytic philosophy").
Some philosophers, such as Richard Rorty and Simon Glendinning, argue that this "analytic–continental" divide is inimical to the discipline as a whole.
Afterwards, analytic and continental philosophers differ on the importance and influence of subsequent philosophers on their respective traditions.
Although, since analytic and continental philosophy have such starkly different views of philosophy after Kant, continental philosophy is also often understood in an extended sense to include any post-Kant philosophers or movements important to continental philosophy but not analytic philosophy.
Thus continental philosophy tends toward historicism, where analytic philosophy tends to treat philosophy in terms of discrete problems, capable of being analyzed apart from their historical origins.
The major orthodox schools arose sometime between the start of the Common Era and the Gupta Empire.
These religio-philosophical traditions were later grouped under the label Hinduism.
Western scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no single founder.
Indian philosophers developed a system of epistemological reasoning (pramana) and logic and investigated topics such as Ontology (metaphysics, Brahman-Atman, Sunyata-Anatta), reliable means of knowledge (epistemology, Pramanas), value system (axiology) and other topics.
Later developments include the development of Tantra and Iranian-Islamic influences.
Nyāya traditionally accepts four Pramanas as reliable means of gaining knowledge – Pratyakṣa (perception), Anumāṇa (inference), Upamāṇa (comparison and analogy) and Śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).
This philosophy held that the universe was reducible to paramāṇu (atoms), which are indestructible (anitya), indivisible, and have a special kind of dimension, called “small” (aṇu).
Later Vaiśeṣikas (Śrīdhara and Udayana and Śivāditya) added one more category abhava (non-existence).
Because of their focus on textual study and interpretation, Mīmāṃsā also developed theories of philology and the philosophy of language which influenced other Indian schools.
The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy include a mind-body dualism, denial of a creative and omnipotent God, karma, an eternal and uncreated universe, non-violence, the theory of the multiple facets of truth, and morality based on liberation of the soul.
It has also been called a model of philosophical liberalism for its insistence that truth is relative and multifaceted and for its willingness to accommodate all possible view-points of the rival philosophies.
Cārvāka philosophers like Brihaspati were extremely critical of other schools of philosophy of the time.
It is the dominant philosophical tradition in Tibet and Southeast Asian countries like Sri Lanka and Burma.
Later Buddhist philosophical traditions developed complex phenomenological psychologies termed 'Abhidharma'.
This tradition contributed to what has been called an "epistemological turn" in Indian philosophy.
Important exponents of Buddhist modernism include Anagarika Dharmapala (1864–1933) and the American convert Henry Steel Olcott, the Chinese modernists Taixu (1890–1947) and Yin Shun (1906–2005), Zen scholar D.T. Suzuki, and the Tibetan Gendün Chöphel (1903–1951).
Anthropology is the scientific study of humanity, concerned with human behavior, human biology, cultures and societies, in both the present and past, including past human species.
Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.
Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed.
When slavery was abolished in France in 1848, the Société was abandoned.
For them, the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect.
There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences.
His definition now became "the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature".
He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called Broca's area after him.
The last two volumes were published posthumously.
He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.
Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists.
Representatives from the French Société were present, though not Broca.
Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.
One notable exception was the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory (1869) founded by Rudolph Virchow, known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists.
The major theorists belonged to these organizations.
Practical anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene.
This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas' arguments against 19th-century racial ideology, through Margaret Mead's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism.
In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate.
Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among individuals and groups.
There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.
This project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography.
Participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.
The study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a human universal.
Ethnography views first-hand experience and social context as important.
Ethnomusicology can be used in a wide variety of fields, such as teaching, politics, cultural anthropology etc.
Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange.
The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes.
Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer?
Within kinship you have two different families.
Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white feminists of Europe, America, and elsewhere.
Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more "complex" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena.
Secondly, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions).
It is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology, and sometimes considered part of material culture.
It is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today.
Various social processes in the Western World as well as in the "Third World" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of "specialists in 'other cultures'" closer to their homes.
It is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, ethology, medicine, psychology, veterinary medicine and zoology.
It is the study of ancient humans, as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints.
In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe.
This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another's values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms.
Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.
At the same time, David H. Price's work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.
Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association (AAA).
The Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous.
One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.
These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.
On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.
Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as Olduwan or Mousterian or Levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.
A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.
These include expressive forms like art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies like tool usage, cooking, shelter, and clothing.
The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been used to distinguish civilizations from less complex societies.
Mass culture refers to the mass-produced and mass mediated forms of consumer culture that emerged in the 20th century.
In the wider social sciences, the theoretical perspective of cultural materialism holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in evolved biological dispositions.
In this sense, multiculturalism values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet.
In 1986, philosopher Edward S. Casey wrote, "The very word culture meant 'place tilled' in Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin colere, 'to inhabit, care for, till, worship' and cultus, 'A cult, especially a religious one.'
Thus a contrast between "culture" and "civilization" is usually implied in these authors, even when not expressed as such.
This ability arose with the evolution of behavioral modernity in humans around 50,000 years ago and is often thought to be unique to humans.
Rein Raud, building on the work of Umberto Eco, Pierre Bourdieu and Jeffrey C. Alexander, has proposed a model of cultural change based on claims and bids, which are judged by their cognitive adequacy and endorsed or not endorsed by the symbolic authority of the cultural community in question.
Culture repositioning means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.
Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new cultural models, and spurring or enabling generative action.
Environmental conditions may also enter as factors.
War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics.
For example, Western restaurant chains and culinary brands sparked curiosity and fascination to the Chinese as China opened its economy to international trade in the late 20th-century.
He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently.
Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of Bildung: "For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people."
According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups.
He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements.
a particular way of life, whether of a people, period or a group.
In other words, the idea of "culture" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.
According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others.
Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and sophistication of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature.
In 1870 the anthropologist Edward Tylor (1832–1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the evolution of religion.
For sociologist Georg Simmel (1858–1918), culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."
Non-material culture refers to the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made.
Cultural sociology was then "reinvented" in the English-speaking world as a product of the "cultural turn" of the 1960s, which ushered in structuralist and postmodern approaches to social science.
Culture" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like social stratification and social network analysis.
They saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by relations of production, which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.
It has since become strongly associated with Stuart Hall, who succeeded Hoggart as Director.
These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television or eating out) in a given culture.
Watching television to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends to "fit in" certainly qualifies since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice.
Culture" for a cultural-studies researcher not only includes traditional high culture (the culture of ruling social groups) and popular culture, but also everyday meanings and practices.
Scholars in the United Kingdom and the United States developed somewhat different versions of cultural studies after the late 1970s.
The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.
The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the production of meaning.
Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view.
Culture psychologists began to try to explore the relationship between emotions and culture, and answer whether the human mind is independent from culture.
On the other hand, some researchers try to look for differences between people's personalities across cultures.
For example, people who are raised in a culture with an abacus are trained with distinctive reasoning style.
Basically, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of Cultural Diversity deal with the protection of culture.
Under international law, the UN and UNESCO try to set up and enforce rules for this.
The target of the attack is the identity of the opponent, which is why symbolic cultural assets become a main target.
A festival is an event ordinarily celebrated by a community and centering on some characteristic aspect of that community and its religion or cultures.
Next to religion and folklore, a significant origin is agricultural.
Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanking to the gods, goddesses or saints: they're called patronal festivals.
In Ancient Greece and Rome, festivals such as the Saturnalia were closely associated with social organisation and political processes as well as religion.
In Middle English, a "festival dai" was a religious holiday.
The term "feast" is also used in common secular parlance as a synonym for any large or elaborate meal.
The most important religious festivals such as Christmas, Rosh Hashanah, Diwali, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha serve to mark out the year.
An early example is the festival established by Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses III celebrating his victory over the Libyans.
There are numerous types of festivals in the world and most countries celebrate important events or traditions with traditional cultural events and activities.
Ancient Egyptian festivals could be either religious or political.
The Sed festival, for example, celebrated the thirtieth year of an Egyptian pharaoh's rule and then every three (or four in one case) years after that.
In the Christian liturgical calendar, there are two principal feasts, properly known as the Feast of the Nativity of our Lord (Christmas) and the Feast of the Resurrection (Easter), but minor festivals in honour of local patron saints are celebrated in almost all countries influenced by Christianity.
Buddhist religious festivals, such as Esala Perahera are held in Sri Lanka and Thailand.
Film festivals involve the screenings of several different films, and are usually held annually.
There are also specific beverage festivals, such as the famous Oktoberfest in Germany for beer.
Ancient Egyptians relied upon the seasonal inundation caused by the Nile River, a form of irrigation, which provided fertile land for crops.
Dree Festival of the Apatanis living in Lower Subansiri District of Arunachal Pradesh is celebrated every year from July 4 to 7 by praying for a bumper crop harvest.
A holiday is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, especially business or work including school, are suspended or reduced.
The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job held or personal choices.
In most modern societies, however, holidays serve as much of a recreational function as any other weekend days or activities.
In some cases, a holiday may only be nominally observed.
The modern use varies geographically.
For example, Monkey Day is celebrated on December 14, International Talk Like a Pirate Day is observed on September 19, and Blasphemy Day is held on September 30.
Jehovah's Witnesses annually commemorate "The Memorial of Jesus Christ's Death", but do not celebrate other holidays with any religious significance such as Easter, Christmas or New Year's.
Ahmadi Muslims additionally celebrate Promised Messiah Day, Promised Reformer Day, and Khilafat Day, but contrary to popular belief, neither are regarded as holidays.
Celtic, Norse, and Neopagan holidays follow the order of the Wheel of the Year.
Researchers in bioarchaeology combine the skill sets of human osteology, paleopathology, and archaeology, and often consider the cultural and mortuary context of the remains.
Evolutionary psychology is the study of psychological structures from a modern evolutionary perspective.
Human behavioral ecology is the study of behavioral adaptations (foraging, reproduction, ontogeny) from the evolutionary and ecologic perspectives (see behavioral ecology).
Paleoanthropology is the study of fossil evidence for human evolution, mainly using remains from extinct hominin and other primate species to determine the morphological and behavioral changes in the human lineage, as well as the environment in which human evolution occurred.
The name is even relatively new, having been 'physical anthropology' for over a century, with some practitioners still applying that term.
Some editors, see below, have rooted the field even deeper than formal science.
This became the main system through which scholars thought about nature for the next roughly 2,000 years.
He also wrote about physiognomy, an idea derived from writings in the Hippocratic Corpus.
In the 19th century, French physical anthropologists, led by Paul Broca (1824-1880), focused on craniometry while the German tradition, led by Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902), emphasized the influence of environment and disease upon the human body.
He changed the focus from racial typology to concentrate upon the study of human evolution, moving away from classification towards evolutionary process.
A race is a grouping of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society.
Modern science regards race as a social construct, an identity which is assigned based on rules made by society.
Still others argue that, among humans, race has no taxonomic significance because all living humans belong to the same subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens.
In South Africa, the Population Registration Act, 1950 recognized only White, Black, and Coloured, with Indians added later.
The United States Census Bureau proposed but then withdrew plans to add a new category to classify Middle Eastern and North African peoples in the U.S. Census 2020, over a dispute over whether this classification should be considered a white ethnicity or a separate race.
The establishment of racial boundaries often involves the subjugation of groups defined as racially inferior, as in the one-drop rule used in the 19th-century United States to exclude those with any amount of African ancestry from the dominant racial grouping, defined as "white".
According to geneticist David Reich, "while race may be a social construct, differences in genetic ancestry that happen to correlate to many of today's racial constructs are real."
Other dimensions of racial groupings include shared history, traditions, and language.
Socioeconomic factors, in combination with early but enduring views of race, have led to considerable suffering within disadvantaged racial groups.
Racism has led to many instances of tragedy, including slavery and genocide.
Because in some societies racial groupings correspond closely with patterns of social stratification, for social scientists studying social inequality, race can be a significant variable.
For example, in 2008, John Hartigan, Jr. argued for a view of race that focused primarily on culture, but which does not ignore the potential relevance of biology or genetics.
In this way the idea of race as we understand it today came about during the historical process of exploration and conquest which brought Europeans into contact with groups from different continents, and of the ideology of classification and typology found in the natural sciences.
A set of folk beliefs took hold that linked inherited physical differences between groups to inherited intellectual, behavioral, and moral qualities.
The 1735 classification of Carl Linnaeus, inventor of zoological taxonomy, divided the human species Homo sapiens into continental varieties of europaeus, asiaticus, americanus, and afer, each associated with a different humour: sanguine, melancholic, choleric, and phlegmatic, respectively.
Blumenbach also noted the graded transition in appearances from one group to adjacent groups and suggested that "one variety of mankind does so sensibly pass into the other, that you cannot mark out the limits between them".
It was further argued that some groups may be the result of mixture between formerly distinct populations, but that careful study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce admixed groups.
New studies of culture and the fledgling field of population genetics undermined the scientific standing of racial essentialism, leading race anthropologists to revise their conclusions about the sources of phenotypic variation.
Studies of human genetic variation show that human populations are not geographically isolated, and their genetic differences are far smaller than those among comparable subspecies.
Andreasen cited tree diagrams of relative genetic distances among populations published by Luigi Cavalli-Sforza as the basis for a phylogenetic tree of human races (p. 661).
Marks, Templeton, and Cavalli-Sforza all conclude that genetics does not provide evidence of human races.
For example, with respect to skin color in Europe and Africa, Brace writes:To this day, skin color grades by imperceptible means from Europe southward around the eastern end of the Mediterranean and up the Nile into Africa.
He further argued that one could use the term race if one distinguished between "race differences" and "the race concept".
In short, Livingstone and Dobzhansky agree that there are genetic differences among human beings; they also agree that the use of the race concept to classify people, and how the race concept is used, is a matter of social convention.
As the anthropologists Leonard Lieberman and Fatimah Linda Jackson observed, "Discordant patterns of heterogeneity falsify any description of a population as if it were genotypically or even phenotypically homogeneous".
The mid-20th-century anthropologist William C. Boyd defined race as: "A population which differs significantly from other populations in regard to the frequency of one or more of the genes it possesses.
Moreover, the anthropologist Stephen Molnar has suggested that the discordance of clines inevitably results in a multiplication of races that renders the concept itself useless.
Joanna Mountain and Neil Risch cautioned that while genetic clusters may one day be shown to correspond to phenotypic variations between groups, such assumptions were premature as the relationship between genes and complex traits remains poorly understood.
Any category you come up with is going to be imperfect, but that doesn't preclude you from using it or the fact that it has utility.
This assumed three population groups separated by large geographic ranges (European, African and East Asian).
Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves, have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as "continental races", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations.
Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials.
Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers).
Alongside empirical and conceptual problems with "race", following the Second World War, evolutionary and social scientists were acutely aware of how beliefs about race had been used to justify discrimination, apartheid, slavery, and genocide.
Craig Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institute of Health jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome in 2000.
It's not a scientific one.
Anthropologist Stephan Palmié has argued that race "is not a thing but a social relation"; or, in the words of Katya Gibel Mevorach, "a metonym", "a human invention whose criteria for differentiation are neither universal nor fixed but have always been used to manage difference."
There, racial identity was not governed by rigid descent rule, such as the one-drop rule, as it was in the United States.
These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and not one category stands significantly isolated from the rest.
New Jersey: Prentice Hall Inc, 1984.
In European context, historical resonance of "race" underscores its problematic nature.
The concept of racial origin relies on the notion that human beings can be separated into biologically distinct "races", an idea generally rejected by the scientific community.
In the United States most people who self-identify as African American have some European ancestors, while many people who identify as European American have some African or Amerindian ancestors.
The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century.
Amerindians continue to be defined by a certain percentage of "Indian blood" (called blood quantum).
This rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some discernible African ancestry were defined as black.
The term "Hispanic" as an ethnonym emerged in the 20th century with the rise of migration of laborers from the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America to the United States.
Three factors, country of academic education, discipline, and age, were found to be significant in differentiating the replies.
In 2007, Ann Morning interviewed over 40 American biologists and anthropologists and found significant disagreements over the nature of race, with no one viewpoint holding a majority among either group.
While he can see good arguments for both sides, the complete denial of the opposing evidence "seems to stem largely from socio-political motivation and not science at all".
In partial response to Gill's statement, Professor of Biological Anthropology C. Loring Brace argues that the reason laymen and biological anthropologists can determine the geographic ancestry of an individual can be explained by the fact that biological characteristics are clinally distributed across the planet, and that does not translate into the concept of race.
Physical anthropology texts argued that biological races exist until the 1970s, when they began to argue that races do not exist.
In February 2001, the editors of Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine asked "authors to not use race and ethnicity when there is no biological, scientific, or sociological reason for doing so."
Morning (2008) looked at high school biology textbooks during the 1952–2002 period and initially found a similar pattern with only 35% directly discussing race in the 1983–92 period from initially 92% doing so.
In general, the material on race has moved from surface traits to genetics and evolutionary history.
She notes, "At best, one can conclude that biologists and anthropologists now appear equally divided in their beliefs about the nature of race."
33 health services researchers from differing geographic regions were interviewed in a 2008 study.
Many sociologists focused on African Americans, called Negroes at that time, and claimed that they were inferior to whites.
His solution was largely based on Al-Khwarizmi's work.
However, at some point the quadratic formula begins to lose accuracy because of round off error, while the approximate method continues to improve.
Methods of numerical approximation existed, called prosthaphaeresis, that offered shortcuts around time-consuming operations such as multiplication and taking powers and roots.
Computational algorithms for finding the solutions are an important part of numerical linear algebra, and play a prominent role in engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, and economics.
For solutions in an integral domain like the ring of the integers, or in other algebraic structures, other theories have been developed, see Linear equation over a ring.
This allows all the language and theory of vector spaces (or more generally, modules) to be brought to bear.
Such a system is known as an underdetermined system.
The second system has a single unique solution, namely the intersection of the two lines.
Any two of these equations have a common solution.
A system of equations whose left-hand sides are linearly independent is always consistent.
This yields a system of equations with one fewer equation and one fewer unknown.
Type 3: Add to one row a scalar multiple of another.
For instance, systems with a symmetric positive definite matrix can be solved twice as fast with the Cholesky decomposition.
A completely different approach is often taken for very large systems, which would otherwise take too much time or memory.
This leads to the class of iterative methods.
In mathematics, a series is, roughly speaking, a description of the operation of adding infinitely many quantities, one after the other, to a given starting quantity.
In addition to their ubiquity in mathematics, infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as physics, computer science, statistics and finance.
Zeno's paradox of Achilles and the tortoise illustrates this counterintuitive property of infinite sums: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of the tortoise at the beginning of the race, the tortoise has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, the tortoise is at a third position, and so on.
This argument does not prove that the sum is equal to 2 (although it is), but it does prove that it is at most 2.
Tests for uniform convergence include the Weierstrass' M-test, Abel's uniform convergence test, Dini's test, and the Cauchy criterion.
The convergence is uniform on closed and bounded (that is, compact) subsets of the interior of the disc of convergence: to wit, it is uniformly convergent on compact sets.
The Hilbert–Poincaré series is a formal power series used to study graded algebras.
In the 17th century, James Gregory worked in the new decimal system on infinite series and published several Maclaurin series.
Cauchy (1821) insisted on strict tests of convergence; he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so, and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria.
A summability method is such an assignment of a limit to a subset of the set of divergent series which properly extends the classical notion of convergence.
Indian scholars have been using factorial formulas since at least the 12th century.
In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.
Other implementations (such as computer software such as spreadsheet programs) can often handle larger values.
Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.
There are, relatively speaking, no such simple solutions for factorials; no finite combination of sums, products, powers, exponential functions, or logarithms will suffice to express ; but it is possible to find a general formula for factorials using tools such as integrals and limits from calculus.
The integrals we have discussed so far involve transcendental functions, but the gamma function also arises from integrals of purely algebraic functions.
By taking limits, certain rational products with infinitely many factors can be evaluated in terms of the gamma function as well.
Its history, notably documented by Philip J. Davis in an article that won him the 1963 Chauvenet Prize, reflects many of the major developments within mathematics since the 18th century.
Instead of finding a specialized proof for each formula, it would be desirable to have a general method of identifying the gamma function.
However, the gamma function does not appear to satisfy any simple differential equation.
The Bohr–Mollerup theorem is useful because it is relatively easy to prove logarithmic convexity for any of the different formulas used to define the gamma function.
As electronic computers became available for the production of tables in the 1950s, several extensive tables for the complex gamma function were published to meet the demand, including a table accurate to 12 decimal places from the U.S. National Bureau of Standards.
In science, a formula is a concise way of expressing information symbolically, as in a mathematical formula or a chemical formula.
In mathematics, a formula generally refers to an identity which equates one mathematical expression to another, with the most important ones being mathematical theorems.
This convention, while less important in a relatively simple formula, means that mathematicians can more quickly manipulate formulas which are larger and more complex.
For example, H2O is the chemical formula for water, specifying that each molecule consists of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom.
In empirical formulas, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound—as ratios to the key element.
Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written as empirical formulas which contains only the whole numbers.
There are several types of these formulas, including molecular formulas and condensed formulas.
Functions were originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity.
This definition of "graph" refers to a set of pairs of objects.
When the domain and the codomain are sets of real numbers, each such pair may be thought of as the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane.
Occasionally, it may be identified with the function, but this hides the usual interpretation of a function as a process.
A map can have any set as its codomain, while, in some contexts, typically in older books, the codomain of a function is specifically the set of real or complex numbers.
Another common example is the error function.
Power series can be used to define functions on the domain in which they converge.
Then, the power series can be used to enlarge the domain of the function.
Parts of this may create a plot that represents (parts of) the function.
This is the canonical factorization of .
At that time, only real-valued functions of a real variable were considered, and all functions were assumed to be smooth.
Functions are now used throughout all areas of mathematics.
This is how inverse trigonometric functions are defined in terms of trigonometric functions, where the trigonometric functions are monotonic.
Usefulness of the concept of multi-valued functions is clearer when considering complex functions, typically analytic functions.
Such a function is called the principal value of the function.
Functional programming is the programming paradigm consisting of building programs by using only subroutines that behave like mathematical functions.
Except for computer-language terminology, "function" has the usual mathematical meaning in computer science.
Terms are manipulated through some rules, (the -equivalence, the -reduction, and the -conversion), which are the axioms of the theory and may be interpreted as rules of computation.
Nicolas Chuquet used a form of exponential notation in the 15th century, which was later used by Henricus Grammateus and Michael Stifel in the 16th century.
Thus they would write polynomials, for example, as .
The result is always a positive real number, and the identities and properties shown above for integer exponents remain true with these definitions for real exponents.
This function equals the usual th root for positive real radicands.
This is the starting point of the mathematical theory of semigroups.
We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get Vn, although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n, this is defined only up to isomorphism.

Iterating tetration leads to another operation, and so on, a concept named hyperoperation.
In applied settings, exponential functions model a relationship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same proportional change (that is, percentage increase or decrease) in the dependent variable.
This function property leads to exponential growth or exponential decay.
Similarly, the composition of onto (surjective) functions is always onto.
Then one can form chains of transformations composed together, such as .
This alternative notation is called postfix notation.
This alternative notation is called postfix notation.
