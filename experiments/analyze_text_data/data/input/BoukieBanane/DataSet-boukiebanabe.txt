LITERACY INSIDE OUT

WHY A FEW SUCCEED WHERE MOST FAIL?
Recently, while we were talking about the different aspects of the literacy issue, my son-in-law, Sam Naidoo (65 years old), asked me if I could explain why and how he succeeded in mastering functional literacy and numeracy although his home language was Mauritian Creole (MC) and his parents possessed only a few rudiments of basic literacy and could not be considered literate. I found it a very pertinent question. And I thought about my own history.
I was born in Quartier Militaire of Telugu parents and grew up in Goodlands. Both parents spoke MC, my mother tongue, to each other and to me. My mother, Gouna, was a fan of Ti-Frer and sang his songs to me. I still remember a few lines from the songs:
1. Letan mo ti kontan twa Lilinn
Personn pa ti kone.
Aster mo kit twa, mo ale,
To pik mwa dan zournal.
2. Pa bate li misie,
Ayo mo gran misie!
Li pe koz laverite,
Li pa enn pares,
So saret ti tas dan labou.
3. Charlio, Charli
Aret bwar, aret bwar diven banann!
Dan diven banann ena bebet sizo.
I went to Goodlands Government School and my class was never packed as classes are today. I believe that most pupils were from middle and lower middle-class backgrounds. Very few working-class parents would send their children to school for girls were to help their mothers with household chores and boys were to help their fathers in the field or look after domestic animals. Moreover, teachers were mostly townspeople.
At school, I had to learn to read, write and speak English and French; to know the 11 multiplication tables (table 2 to table 12) from top to bottom and from bottom to top in MC; learn basic Arithmetic; know some geography; and learn good handwriting (penmanship). Teachers not only had small classes to control but they also gave personal-individual (not big group as today) private tuition for a modest fee.
I was a lower middle-class child and very lucky for both parents had mastered basic literacy and numeracy. I had the necessary back up from parents and personal private tutors.
It is to be noted that my paternal grandfather was a ‘sirdar’, in charge of several sugar estate workers; my maternal grandfather was a ‘marker’ (he could read and write basic things such as names, dates and time) and was responsible to keep a register of all workers in his department. Literacy was part of my family culture. Both grandfathers also invested in small businesses successfully and became respected notables in their villages.
School was responsible for the development and prestige of an elite. In the 1970’s, the scene changed dramatically. The authorities decided that schooling should be compulsory for all and parents who do not send their children to school would face legal action. Schools, classes, teachers, and pupils grew in number and size – a good thing in itself – but no thought was given to the need to question ‘medium of instruction’ which remained the same. Working-class and lower working-class children, a great majority in all classes, were totally lost. WHY?
School promoted middle-class culture and working-class and lower working-class children found themselves in an alien environment. Classes became more and more unruly. As examination standard was deliberately lowered to help more children through, the small elite scored very high marks. Moreover, private fee-paying schools started to flourish for middle-class parents wanted something better for their children.
Vote-catching strategies turned a blind eye to real problems. The refusal to use the mother tongue of most Mauritians, i.e. MC, as medium in the initial stage of education, has continued to this day and consequently 70% of the population have remained non-literate and non-numerate. Thousands of kids remain totally non-literate and non-numerate after up to 10 years at school.
ANYTHING WE CAN DO? In a recent article, this is what I proposed.
“Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and ‘Arismetik’ (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.”
Look at this:
TAN EK ASPE/TENSE AND ASPECTS
MC
Prezan: Mo bwar dilo.
Prezan kontinie: Mo pe bwar dilo.
Prezan parfe: Mo finn bwar dilo.
Pase: Mo ti bwar dilo.
Pase kontinie: Mo ti pe bwar dilo.
Pase parfe: Mo ti finn bwar dilo.
Fitir: Mo pou bwar dilo.
Fitir dan pase: Mo ti pou bwar dilo.
ENGLISH
Present tense: I drink water.
Present continuous: I am drinking water.
Present perfect: I have drunk water.
Past tense: I drank water.
Past continuous: I was drinking water.
Past perfect: I had drunk water.
Future: I will drink water.
Future in the past: I would drink water.
The syntactic structures of MC and English are almost identical because English is also a creole language.
Why do we refuse to use resources at our disposal to make of Mauritius the land of FUNCTIONAL-BILINGUAL-LITERACY?

OPEN LETTER TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PRIME MINISTER
NOBLE MINDS FACE FAILURE WITH EQUANIMITY!
Dear Prime Minister,
Allow me to share with you the following observations and thoughts.
As a nation we now invest nearly 20 billion rupees every year on education. Is the money well-spent? In my humble submission, the answer is NO. Why? For more than 50 years, we have focused on quantity in terms of subject matter and accessibility to learning – not a bad thing in itself – but failed to develop national literacy deliberately confusing it with schooling. This appears clearly in the form regularly filled by the ministry of education for UNESCO. As no research has been conducted on literacy, officers simply put down the percentage of children who go to school, assuming that all schooled children do acquire literacy which includes numeracy.
Let us first define literacy. It means the ability to read, write and count. Moreover, there are 3 levels of literacy: basic, functional, and advanced.
• BASIC LITERACY means that the persons concerned can write on themselves a short grammatically correct and well-punctuated text, in the language of their choice, which tells us, in about 150 words, who they are. I think that less than 30% of the population can do this and that 70% of the population can only draw a copy of their names or use their thumb marks.
• FUNCTIONAL LITERACY means “the capacity of a person to engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective function of his or her group and community and also for enabling him or her to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his or her own and the community’s development” (UNESCO Institute for Statistics). It includes information literacy, digital literacy, and media literacy. I believe that a good S.C and H.S.C certificate (O and A level) may ensure functional literacy to holders of these certificates, i.e., about 20% of the population.
• ADVANCED LITERACY is what is required for university studies and professional activities, and it is the prestigious competency of about 10% of the population, an elite which jealously guards and protects its privileges and interests.
I will surely be accused of exaggeration. My answer is very simple: remove party symbols on ballot papers and see what happens.
WHY HAVE WE FAILED?
• In Mauritius we confuse literacy with language learning and mother tongue reality is ignored. First of all, the term ‘mother tongue’ is misunderstood and many think that it means the language of our ancestors (French, Bhojpuri, Tamil, Telugu, Cantonese etc.) or some prestigious languages (Hindi, Urdu, Mandarin Chinese). In fact, it means the language used by parents which a child starts to learn while still in the mother’s womb and the language which the child uses in his/her home and social environment.
• Here are the facts: Morisien/Mauritian (Mauritian Creole) is the mother tongue/first language/L1 of 90% of the population and the second language/L2 of the remaining 10%. It is the best medium to help our children master basic literacy after which they will learn second languages (French, Hindi etc.) more easily. But ignorance, prejudices and hysterical language loyalty are so rife that politicians prefer to avoid the issue.
• English is not only our official language but also the most important international language. Moreover, it is a ‘creole’ language which developed some 1,200 years ago when Vikings invaded England and occupied a large territory. It started as a pidgin and with time became the national/official language of the UK in the 16th-17th centuries and later the language of the British Empire and now it is a quasi-universal language.
• As our national language and our official language are both creole languages which are analytic as opposed to synthetic languages like French, Hindi or Arabic, a sound language policy would make of Mauritius the land of functional-bilingual literacy. Again, because of ignorance, prejudices, and hysterical language loyalty no government has had, so far, the courage to take the bull by the horns.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
Governments have created, to no avail, special classes (PREVOC and Extended Programme) for the thousands of our children who, after 6-10 years at school, remain absolutely non-literate and non-numerate because of a catastrophic language policy which ignores the use of our mother tongue as medium, not to be confused with language as subject.
Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and Arismetik (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.

OPEN LETTER TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PRIME MINISTER
NOBLE MINDS FACE FAILURE WITH EQUANIMITY!
Dear Prime Minister,
Allow me to share with you the following observations and thoughts.
As a nation we now invest nearly 20 billion rupees every year on education. Is the money well-spent? In my humble submission, the answer is NO. Why? For more than 50 years, we have focused on quantity in terms of subject matter and accessibility to learning – not a bad thing in itself – but failed to develop national literacy deliberately confusing it with schooling. This appears clearly in the form regularly filled by the ministry of education for UNESCO. As no research has been conducted on literacy, officers simply put down the percentage of children who go to school, assuming that all schooled children do acquire literacy which includes numeracy.
Let us first define literacy. It means the ability to read, write and count. Moreover, there are 3 levels of literacy: basic, functional, and advanced.
• BASIC LITERACY means that the persons concerned can write on themselves a short grammatically correct and well-punctuated text, in the language of their choice, which tells us, in about 150 words, who they are. I think that less than 30% of the population can do this and that 70% of the population can only draw a copy of their names or use their thumb marks.
• FUNCTIONAL LITERACY means “the capacity of a person to engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective function of his or her group and community and also for enabling him or her to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his or her own and the community’s development” (UNESCO Institute for Statistics). It includes information literacy, digital literacy, and media literacy. I believe that a good S.C and H.S.C certificate (O and A level) may ensure functional literacy to holders of these certificates, i.e., about 20% of the population.
• ADVANCED LITERACY is what is required for university studies and professional activities, and it is the prestigious competency of about 10% of the population, an elite which jealously guards and protects its privileges and interests.
I will surely be accused of exaggeration. My answer is very simple: remove party symbols on ballot papers and see what happens.
WHY HAVE WE FAILED?
• In Mauritius we confuse literacy with language learning and mother tongue reality is ignored. First of all, the term ‘mother tongue’ is misunderstood and many think that it means the language of our ancestors (French, Bhojpuri, Tamil, Telugu, Cantonese etc.) or some prestigious languages (Hindi, Urdu, Mandarin Chinese). In fact, it means the language used by parents which a child starts to learn while still in the mother’s womb and the language which the child uses in his/her home and social environment.
• Here are the facts: Morisien/Mauritian (Mauritian Creole) is the mother tongue/first language/L1 of 90% of the population and the second language/L2 of the remaining 10%. It is the best medium to help our children master basic literacy after which they will learn second languages (French, Hindi etc.) more easily. But ignorance, prejudices and hysterical language loyalty are so rife that politicians prefer to avoid the issue.
• English is not only our official language but also the most important international language. Moreover, it is a ‘creole’ language which developed some 1,200 years ago when Vikings invaded England and occupied a large territory. It started as a pidgin and with time became the national/official language of the UK in the 16th-17th centuries and later the language of the British Empire and now it is a quasi-universal language.
• As our national language and our official language are both creole languages which are analytic as opposed to synthetic languages like French, Hindi or Arabic, a sound language policy would make of Mauritius the land of functional-bilingual literacy. Again, because of ignorance, prejudices, and hysterical language loyalty no government has had, so far, the courage to take the bull by the horns.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
Governments have created, to no avail, special classes (PREVOC and Extended Programme) for the thousands of our children who, after 6-10 years at school, remain absolutely non-literate and non-numerate because of a catastrophic language policy which ignores the use of our mother tongue as medium, not to be confused with language as subject.
Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and Arismetik (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.
Brotherly namaste,
Dev

WHY A FEW SUCCEED WHERE MOST FAIL?
Recently, while we were talking about the different aspects of the literacy issue, my son-in-law, Sam Naidoo (65 years old), asked me if I could explain why and how he succeeded in mastering functional literacy and numeracy although his home language was Mauritian Creole (MC) and his parents possessed only a few rudiments of basic literacy and could not be considered literate. I found it a very pertinent question. And I thought about my own history.
I was born in Quartier Militaire of Telugu parents and grew up in Goodlands. Both parents spoke MC, my mother tongue, to each other and to me. My mother, Gouna, was a fan of Ti-Frer and sang his songs to me. I still remember a few lines from the songs:
1. Letan mo ti kontan twa Lilinn
Personn pa ti kone.
Aster mo kit twa, mo ale,
To pik mwa dan zournal.
2. Pa bate li misie,
Ayo mo gran misie!
Li pe koz laverite,
Li pa enn pares,
So saret ti tas dan labou.
3. Charlio, Charli
Aret bwar, aret bwar diven banann!
Dan diven banann ena bebet sizo.
I went to Goodlands Government School and my class was never packed as classes are today. I believe that most pupils were from middle and lower middle-class backgrounds. Very few working-class parents would send their children to school for girls were to help their mothers with household chores and boys were to help their fathers in the field or look after domestic animals. Moreover, teachers were mostly townspeople.
At school, I had to learn to read, write and speak English and French; to know the 11 multiplication tables (table 2 to table 12) from top to bottom and from bottom to top in MC; learn basic Arithmetic; know some geography; and learn good handwriting (penmanship). Teachers not only had small classes to control but they also gave personal-individual (not big group as today) private tuition for a modest fee.
I was a lower middle-class child and very lucky for both parents had mastered basic literacy and numeracy. I had the necessary back up from parents and personal private tutors.
It is to be noted that my paternal grandfather was a ‘sirdar’, in charge of several sugar estate workers; my maternal grandfather was a ‘marker’ (he could read and write basic things such as names, dates and time) and was responsible to keep a register of all workers in his department. Literacy was part of my family culture. Both grandfathers also invested in small businesses successfully and became respected notables in their villages.
School was responsible for the development and prestige of an elite. In the 1970’s, the scene changed dramatically. The authorities decided that schooling should be compulsory for all and parents who do not send their children to school would face legal action. Schools, classes, teachers, and pupils grew in number and size – a good thing in itself – but no thought was given to the need to question ‘medium of instruction’ which remained the same. Working-class and lower working-class children, a great majority in all classes, were totally lost. WHY?
School promoted middle-class culture and working-class and lower working-class children found themselves in an alien environment. Classes became more and more unruly. As examination standard was deliberately lowered to help more children through, the small elite scored very high marks. Moreover, private fee-paying schools started to flourish for middle-class parents wanted something better for their children.
Vote-catching strategies turned a blind eye to real problems. The refusal to use the mother tongue of most Mauritians, i.e. MC, as medium in the initial stage of education, has continued to this day and consequently 70% of the population have remained non-literate and non-numerate. Thousands of kids remain totally non-literate and non-numerate after up to 10 years at school.
ANYTHING WE CAN DO? In a recent article, this is what I proposed.
“Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and ‘Arismetik’ (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.”

WALK THE TALK
NO TO DOUBLE STANDARDS!
LET’S WALK THE TALK!
I would like to congratulate the government in general and my friend, Dr K. Jagutpal, in particular, for the wise and appropriate decision (a brave move in the Mauritian context) to legalise and make accessible medical cannabis which eventually will help thousands of our Mauritian sisters and brothers suffering from a wide range of pathologies from cancer to migraine. A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION! Eventually, medical cannabis will be liberalised and made accessible to all those who need this efficient painkiller. Now we must move one step further: the decriminalisation of THC, found in RECREATIONAL CANNABIS, as opposed to INDUSTRIAL CANNABIS, for there is now plenty of evidence that a combination of THC from recreational cannabis and CBD from industrial cannabis, also known as hemp, can help to relieve pains and give comfort to thousands of citizens of the Republic.
Let us stop pretending to be what we are not. Stop the game of ‘VIRGIN WHORES’!
According to the law of Mauritius, recreational cannabis which contains THC, is as dangerous a drug as heroin or cocaine. Most scientific and medical reports on dangerous drugs include the following: alcohol, nicotine (tobacco), Fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, Xanax, oxycodone, ketamine, morphine, valium but ‘marijuana/hashish’ known in Mauritius as ‘ganja’ does not feature in the list. Please note the following:
• In the underground economy, ‘ganja/mas’ business is flourishing.
• On special occasions such as the Hindu festivals of Holi, Divali, Maha Shivaratri, Ganga Snan, ganja is smoked and consumed in the form of bhang and consumers are free to do so.
• For the Rasta community, ganja is a sacred element and is an important ritual requirement of worship, but they are not free to use it. If caught, they end up in prison.
• Ganja consumers are peaceful people while alcohol consumers can become violent and do a lot of harm. Yet ganja is illegal, and alcohol is accessible to one and all.
Why do we tolerate this double standard?
To fight drug trafficking and drug abuse, it is imperative that we have a clear mind and not lump odd things together. One good step in the right direction is to decriminalise the growing and consuming of ganja. Efforts, time, money, and energy thus saved can be diverted to efficiently fight trafficking and abuse of hard drugs.
IT IS TIME TO WALK THE TALK!

LITERACY INSIDE OUT
DEV VIRAHSAWMY
5, Edwin Ythier Street, Rose Hill, 71368, Mauritius

WHY A FEW SUCCEED WHERE MOST FAIL?
Recently, while we were talking about the different aspects of the literacy issue, my son-in-law, Sam Naidoo (65 years old), asked me if I could explain why and how he succeeded in mastering functional literacy and numeracy although his home language was Mauritian Creole (MC) and his parents possessed only a few rudiments of basic literacy and could not be considered literate. I found it a very pertinent question. And I thought about my own history.
I was born in Quartier Militaire of Telugu parents and grew up in Goodlands. Both parents spoke MC, my mother tongue, to each other and to me. My mother, Gouna, was a fan of Ti-Frer and sang his songs to me. I still remember a few lines from the songs:
1. Letan mo ti kontan twa Lilinn
Personn pa ti kone.
Aster mo kit twa, mo ale,
To pik mwa dan zournal.
2. Pa bate li misie,
Ayo mo gran misie!
Li pe koz laverite,
Li pa enn pares,
So saret ti tas dan labou.
3. Charlio, Charli
Aret bwar, aret bwar diven banann!
Dan diven banann ena bebet sizo.
I went to Goodlands Government School and my class was never packed as classes are today. I believe that most pupils were from middle and lower middle-class backgrounds. Very few working-class parents would send their children to school for girls were to help their mothers with household chores and boys were to help their fathers in the field or look after domestic animals. Moreover, teachers were mostly townspeople.
At school, I had to learn to read, write and speak English and French; to know the 11 multiplication tables (table 2 to table 12) from top to bottom and from bottom to top in MC; learn basic Arithmetic; know some geography; and learn good handwriting (penmanship). Teachers not only had small classes to control but they also gave personal-individual (not big group as today) private tuition for a modest fee.
I was a lower middle-class child and very lucky for both parents had mastered basic literacy and numeracy. I had the necessary back up from parents and personal private tutors.
It is to be noted that my paternal grandfather was a ‘sirdar’, in charge of several sugar estate workers; my maternal grandfather was a ‘marker’ (he could read and write basic things such as names, dates and time) and was responsible to keep a register of all workers in his department. Literacy was part of my family culture. Both grandfathers also invested in small businesses successfully and became respected notables in their villages.
School was responsible for the development and prestige of an elite. In the 1970’s, the scene changed dramatically. The authorities decided that schooling should be compulsory for all and parents who do not send their children to school would face legal action. Schools, classes, teachers, and pupils grew in number and size – a good thing in itself – but no thought was given to the need to question ‘medium of instruction’ which remained the same. Working-class and lower working-class children, a great majority in all classes, were totally lost. WHY?
School promoted middle-class culture and working-class and lower working-class children found themselves in an alien environment. Classes became more and more unruly. As examination standard was deliberately lowered to help more children through, the small elite scored very high marks. Moreover, private fee-paying schools started to flourish for middle-class parents wanted something better for their children.
Vote-catching strategies turned a blind eye to real problems. The refusal to use the mother tongue of most Mauritians, i.e. MC, as medium in the initial stage of education, has continued to this day and consequently 70% of the population have remained non-literate and non-numerate. Thousands of kids remain totally non-literate and non-numerate after up to 10 years at school.
ANYTHING WE CAN DO? In a recent article, this is what I proposed.
“Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and ‘Arismetik’ (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.”
Look at this:

The syntactic structures of MC and English are almost identical because English is also a creole language.
Why do we refuse to use resources at our disposal to make of Mauritius the land of FUNCTIONAL-BILINGUAL-LITERACY?

OPEN LETTER TO THE P.M

Date: 09.09.23
OPEN LETTER TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PRIME MINISTER
NOBLE MINDS FACE FAILURE WITH EQUANIMITY!
Dear Prime Minister,
Allow me to share with you the following observations and thoughts.
As a nation we now invest nearly 20 billion rupees every year on education. Is the money well-spent? In my humble submission, the answer is NO. Why? For more than 50 years, we have focused on quantity in terms of subject matter and accessibility to learning – not a bad thing in itself – but failed to develop national literacy deliberately confusing it with schooling. This appears clearly in the form regularly filled by the ministry of education for UNESCO. As no research has been conducted on literacy, officers simply put down the percentage of children who go to school, assuming that all schooled children do acquire literacy which includes numeracy.
Let us first define literacy. It means the ability to read, write and count. Moreover, there are 3 levels of literacy: basic, functional, and advanced.
• BASIC LITERACY means that the persons concerned can write on themselves a short grammatically correct and well-punctuated text, in the language of their choice, which tells us, in about 150 words, who they are. I think that less than 30% of the population can do this and that 70% of the population can only draw a copy of their names or use their thumb marks.
• FUNCTIONAL LITERACY means “the capacity of a person to engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective function of his or her group and community and also for enabling him or her to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his or her own and the community’s development” (UNESCO Institute for Statistics). It includes information literacy, digital literacy, and media literacy. I believe that a good S.C and H.S.C certificate (O and A level) may ensure functional literacy to holders of these certificates, i.e., about 20% of the population.
• ADVANCED LITERACY is what is required for university studies and professional activities, and it is the prestigious competency of about 10% of the population, an elite which jealously guards and protects its privileges and interests.
I will surely be accused of exaggeration. My answer is very simple: remove party symbols on ballot papers and see what happens.
WHY HAVE WE FAILED?
• In Mauritius we confuse literacy with language learning and mother tongue reality is ignored. First of all, the term ‘mother tongue’ is misunderstood and many think that it means the language of our ancestors (French, Bhojpuri, Tamil, Telugu, Cantonese etc.) or some prestigious languages (Hindi, Urdu, Mandarin Chinese). In fact, it means the language used by parents which a child starts to learn while still in the mother’s womb and the language which the child uses in his/her home and social environment.
• Here are the facts: Morisien/Mauritian (Mauritian Creole) is the mother tongue/first language/L1 of 90% of the population and the second language/L2 of the remaining 10%. It is the best medium to help our children master basic literacy after which they will learn second languages (French, Hindi etc.) more easily. But ignorance, prejudices and hysterical language loyalty are so rife that politicians prefer to avoid the issue.
• English is not only our official language but also the most important international language. Moreover, it is a ‘creole’ language which developed some 1,200 years ago when Vikings invaded England and occupied a large territory. It started as a pidgin and with time became the national/official language of the UK in the 16th-17th centuries and later the language of the British Empire and now it is a quasi-universal language.
• As our national language and our official language are both creole languages which are analytic as opposed to synthetic languages like French, Hindi or Arabic, a sound language policy would make of Mauritius the land of functional-bilingual literacy. Again, because of ignorance, prejudices, and hysterical language loyalty no government has had, so far, the courage to take the bull by the horns.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
Governments have created, to no avail, special classes (PREVOC and Extended Programme) for the thousands of our children who, after 6-10 years at school, remain absolutely non-literate and non-numerate because of a catastrophic language policy which ignores the use of our mother tongue as medium, not to be confused with language as subject.
Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and Arismetik (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.

DERNIÈRES NOUVELLES
Paix en soi,
Paix autour de nous,

Au plaisir de vous accueillir à partir du 8 janvier 2024!
Conférence: 75ème anniversaire de la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme
Nous vous invitons à venir célébrer le 75ème anniversaire d’un des textes les plus importants de l’Histoire et des plus pertinents pour l’Humanité… Nous parlerons donc des droits de l’humain et de divers fléaux et sujets de société qui composent son portefolio : VIH, humanitaire, écologie, etc… Venez nous rejoindre pour débattre de tous ces enjeux et de bien d’autres, le tout dans l’optique du Mieux-vivre ensemble. Dans l’attente de votre inscription, au plaisir de vous accueillir!
ECJM: Nouvelle Publication : Laudate Deum
Nous avons le plaisir de vous informer que « LOUEZ DIEU » du Pape François a été publié par les ECJM et sera en vente à Rs. 75 l’exemplaire. Après la lettre encyclique Laudato si’ en 2015, le Pape François reprend la parole dans cette exhortation apostolique consacrée à l’écologie et à la protection de l’environnement. Laudato si’ est aussi toujours en vente à Rs. 100 l’unité.
Les ECJM attendent avec joie votre commande.
Formation : Parcours Vie Spirituelle 2024
Chercher et trouver un sens à sa vie en priant la parole de Dieu… Si vous avez déjà une expérience spirituelle, et que vous souhaitez aller plus loin, alors, ce parcours en début d’année prochaine vous est destiné.

Formation : Grande rentrée annuelle pour la discipline des Études sociales
Formation : Etre parent aujourd'hui
Certains parents d’aujourd’hui se sentent démunis et impuissants devant certains comportements de leurs enfants/ados. D’autres démissionnent trop vite de leurs responsabilités parentales. Certains en voient de toutes les couleurs 🥵. C’est pour cela que Jacques et son équipe Gens2Bout vous ont concocté des sessions de formations très ludiques et pragmatiques, qui vont vous aider dans cette tâche, pas souvent facile 😬.
La formation démarre le mardi 03 octobre 2023 à ICJM, Rose-Hill et se déroulera sur 10 sessions, chaque mardi.
Pour s’enregistrer, cliquez sur le lien suivant: https://forms.gle/yenUJ6v58kYdTzD6A
Merci de bien vouloir diffuser dans vos réseaux respectifs afin que le maximum de parents puisse en bénéficier.

À l’occasion de la nouvelle année universitaire de l’ICJM… lancement d’un nouveau parcours pour la région de l’Est, à l’église St-Esprit Bel Air, à partir du mercredi 27 septembre 2023, par le Dr. Jonathan Ravat, de 18h30 à 21h00. C’est une formation sur la Bible, la foi chrétienne et notre lien de Mauriciens-et-Chrétiens avec le monde qui nous attend. Ce sera un Parcours biblique, catéchétique et spirituel.
Tout le monde est invité! Avis aux intéressés: il faut faire vite pour s’inscrire à l’ICJM sur le 464 4109 ou secretariat@icjm.mu. First come first serve!
Formation: ESE 2023 - Nouveau Testament
L’occasion d’une expérience intellectuelle et spirituelle vous est offerte, un module en auditeur libre! Une invitation à entamer un cheminement par ailleurs interactif, qui apportera un éclairage sur ce qu’est l’Enseignement social de l’Église, en s’appuyant fondamentalement sur le Nouveau Testament… Venez et Voyez! Et surtout, inscrivez-vous!
Formation: Leadership et Spiritualités
Nous sommes heureux d’annoncer une nouvelle aventure, UNE FOIS PAR MOIS, le dernier samedi du mois… Un nouveau Parcours INTERCULTUREL à la découverte des TEXTES SACRÉS des grandes religions qui composent le beau TISSU SOCIAL de la RÉPUBLIQUE DE MAURICE que nous chérissons tant. Il s’agit, encore, de créer des ponts et d’être passerelle au service d’un mieux-vivre-ensemble mauricien. Jetons-nous à l’eau… La République nous attend. Merci de transmettre dans vos réseaux respectifs mais surtout de poser votre regard sur l’une ou l’autre personne que vous connaissez et qui pourrait bénéficier de ce Parcours.

Formation en région.
FORMATION UNIVERSITAIRE À DISTANCE
Fort du nouveau souffle procuré par Kleopas, l’ICJM opère désormais, comme le Service Diocésain de la Formation des formateurs et, à cet effet, nous avons signé un Protocole d’Accord avec Domuni Universitas, en lien avec les Dominicains qui ont une très longue tradition de 800 ans d’enseignement universitaire, en vue d’offrir des cours à distance à des éventuels étudiants en théologie, philosophie, etc. ; ceci permettrait d’utiliser l’outil informatique à bon escient, au service de l’approfondissement et du murissement de la foi chrétienne.
De ce fait, l’ICJM pourra désormais être le point focal de Domuni au sein de notre Diocèse de sorte qu’une fois enregistrés pour suivre des cours en ligne par le biais de l’ICJM, les étudiants locaux ainsi inscrits à Domuni puissent bénéficier d’un tutorat avec l’ICJM pour mener à bien leurs études à distance.
Trois types de formations sont proposés par Domuni : des diplômes européens Licence (3 ans)-Masters (5 ans)-Doctorat ou reconnus par Rome, des formations courtes (2 certificats et 14 brevets) et des modules (cours à la carte). De plus amples renseignements peuvent être obtenus sur le site web suivant : http://www.domuni.eu/fr/universite/presentation. Vous trouverez également en annexe un dépliant présentant Domuni.

LITERACY INSIDE OUT
DEV VIRAHSAWMY
5, Edwin Ythier Street, Rose Hill, 71368, Mauritius

WHY A FEW SUCCEED WHERE MOST FAIL?
Recently, while we were talking about the different aspects of the literacy issue, my son-in-law, Sam Naidoo (65 years old), asked me if I could explain why and how he succeeded in mastering functional literacy and numeracy although his home language was Mauritian Creole (MC) and his parents possessed only a few rudiments of basic literacy and could not be considered literate. I found it a very pertinent question. And I thought about my own history.
I was born in Quartier Militaire of Telugu parents and grew up in Goodlands. Both parents spoke MC, my mother tongue, to each other and to me. My mother, Gouna, was a fan of Ti-Frer and sang his songs to me. I still remember a few lines from the songs:
1. Letan mo ti kontan twa Lilinn
Personn pa ti kone.
Aster mo kit twa, mo ale,
To pik mwa dan zournal.
2. Pa bate li misie,
Ayo mo gran misie!
Li pe koz laverite,
Li pa enn pares,
So saret ti tas dan labou.
3. Charlio, Charli
Aret bwar, aret bwar diven banann!
Dan diven banann ena bebet sizo.
I went to Goodlands Government School and my class was never packed as classes are today. I believe that most pupils were from middle and lower middle-class backgrounds. Very few working-class parents would send their children to school for girls were to help their mothers with household chores and boys were to help their fathers in the field or look after domestic animals. Moreover, teachers were mostly townspeople.
At school, I had to learn to read, write and speak English and French; to know the 11 multiplication tables (table 2 to table 12) from top to bottom and from bottom to top in MC; learn basic Arithmetic; know some geography; and learn good handwriting (penmanship). Teachers not only had small classes to control but they also gave personal-individual (not big group as today) private tuition for a modest fee.
I was a lower middle-class child and very lucky for both parents had mastered basic literacy and numeracy. I had the necessary back up from parents and personal private tutors.
It is to be noted that my paternal grandfather was a ‘sirdar’, in charge of several sugar estate workers; my maternal grandfather was a ‘marker’ (he could read and write basic things such as names, dates and time) and was responsible to keep a register of all workers in his department. Literacy was part of my family culture. Both grandfathers also invested in small businesses successfully and became respected notables in their villages.
School was responsible for the development and prestige of an elite. In the 1970’s, the scene changed dramatically. The authorities decided that schooling should be compulsory for all and parents who do not send their children to school would face legal action. Schools, classes, teachers, and pupils grew in number and size – a good thing in itself – but no thought was given to the need to question ‘medium of instruction’ which remained the same. Working-class and lower working-class children, a great majority in all classes, were totally lost. WHY?
School promoted middle-class culture and working-class and lower working-class children found themselves in an alien environment. Classes became more and more unruly. As examination standard was deliberately lowered to help more children through, the small elite scored very high marks. Moreover, private fee-paying schools started to flourish for middle-class parents wanted something better for their children.
Vote-catching strategies turned a blind eye to real problems. The refusal to use the mother tongue of most Mauritians, i.e. MC, as medium in the initial stage of education, has continued to this day and consequently 70% of the population have remained non-literate and non-numerate. Thousands of kids remain totally non-literate and non-numerate after up to 10 years at school.
ANYTHING WE CAN DO? In a recent article, this is what I proposed.
“Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and ‘Arismetik’ (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.”
Look at this:
TAN EK ASPE/TENSE AND ASPECTS
MC
Prezan: Mo bwar dilo.
Prezan kontinie: Mo pe bwar dilo.
Prezan parfe: Mo finn bwar dilo.
Pase: Mo ti bwar dilo.
Pase kontinie: Mo ti pe bwar dilo.
Pase parfe: Mo ti finn bwar dilo.
Fitir: Mo pou bwar dilo.
Fitir dan pase: Mo ti pou bwar dilo.
ENGLISH
Present tense: I drink water.
Present continuous: I am drinking water.
Present perfect: I have drunk water.
Past tense: I drank water.
Past continuous: I was drinking water.
Past perfect: I had drunk water.
Future: I will drink water.
Future in the past: I would drink water.
The syntactic structures of MC and English are almost identical because English is also a creole language.
Why do we refuse to use resources at our disposal to make of Mauritius the land of FUNCTIONAL-BILINGUAL-LITERACY?

OPEN LETTER TO THE P.M
DEV VIRAHSAWMY
5, Edwin Ythier street, Rose Hill, 71368, Mauritius
limemsa@gmail.com       https://boukiebanane.com
Date: 09.09.23
OPEN LETTER TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PRIME MINISTER
NOBLE MINDS FACE FAILURE WITH EQUANIMITY!
Dear Prime Minister,
Allow me to share with you the following observations and thoughts.
As a nation we now invest nearly 20 billion rupees every year on education. Is the money well-spent? In my humble submission, the answer is NO. Why? For more than 50 years, we have focused on quantity in terms of subject matter and accessibility to learning – not a bad thing in itself – but failed to develop national literacy deliberately confusing it with schooling. This appears clearly in the form regularly filled by the ministry of education for UNESCO. As no research has been conducted on literacy, officers simply put down the percentage of children who go to school, assuming that all schooled children do acquire literacy which includes numeracy.
Let us first define literacy. It means the ability to read, write and count. Moreover, there are 3 levels of literacy: basic, functional, and advanced.
• BASIC LITERACY means that the persons concerned can write on themselves a short grammatically correct and well-punctuated text, in the language of their choice, which tells us, in about 150 words, who they are. I think that less than 30% of the population can do this and that 70% of the population can only draw a copy of their names or use their thumb marks.
• FUNCTIONAL LITERACY means “the capacity of a person to engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective function of his or her group and community and also for enabling him or her to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his or her own and the community’s development” (UNESCO Institute for Statistics). It includes information literacy, digital literacy, and media literacy. I believe that a good S.C and H.S.C certificate (O and A level) may ensure functional literacy to holders of these certificates, i.e., about 20% of the population.
• ADVANCED LITERACY is what is required for university studies and professional activities, and it is the prestigious competency of about 10% of the population, an elite which jealously guards and protects its privileges and interests.
I will surely be accused of exaggeration. My answer is very simple: remove party symbols on ballot papers and see what happens.
WHY HAVE WE FAILED?
• In Mauritius we confuse literacy with language learning and mother tongue reality is ignored. First of all, the term ‘mother tongue’ is misunderstood and many think that it means the language of our ancestors (French, Bhojpuri, Tamil, Telugu, Cantonese etc.) or some prestigious languages (Hindi, Urdu, Mandarin Chinese). In fact, it means the language used by parents which a child starts to learn while still in the mother’s womb and the language which the child uses in his/her home and social environment.
• Here are the facts: Morisien/Mauritian (Mauritian Creole) is the mother tongue/first language/L1 of 90% of the population and the second language/L2 of the remaining 10%. It is the best medium to help our children master basic literacy after which they will learn second languages (French, Hindi etc.) more easily. But ignorance, prejudices and hysterical language loyalty are so rife that politicians prefer to avoid the issue.
• English is not only our official language but also the most important international language. Moreover, it is a ‘creole’ language which developed some 1,200 years ago when Vikings invaded England and occupied a large territory. It started as a pidgin and with time became the national/official language of the UK in the 16th-17th centuries and later the language of the British Empire and now it is a quasi-universal language.
• As our national language and our official language are both creole languages which are analytic as opposed to synthetic languages like French, Hindi or Arabic, a sound language policy would make of Mauritius the land of functional-bilingual literacy. Again, because of ignorance, prejudices, and hysterical language loyalty no government has had, so far, the courage to take the bull by the horns.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
Governments have created, to no avail, special classes (PREVOC and Extended Programme) for the thousands of our children who, after 6-10 years at school, remain absolutely non-literate and non-numerate because of a catastrophic language policy which ignores the use of our mother tongue as medium, not to be confused with language as subject.
Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and Arismetik (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.
Brotherly namaste,
Dev

LAKOZ EK LEFE
LAKOZ EK LEFE
(CAUSE AND EFFECT)
Ena enn lien solid ant nou lang ek nou lespri. Enn lang devlope axeler devlopman lespri dimoun ki servi li. Enn bon konesans lor lang ki nou servi, li neseser pou devlopman nou lespri. Move itilizasion enn lang li blok devlopman nou lespri. Plis nou rafinn nou lang plis nou lespri vinn rafine; plis nou lespri vinn rafine, plis nou lang vinn rafine. Si nou koz nou lang enn manier bankal, nou lespri vinn bankal; si nou reflesi enn manier bankal, nou lang ek expresion vinn bankal e kominikasion vinn bankal. Lang ek lespri zot de kote konplemanter mem zouti dan lavi enn imen.
Kan mo ekout enn Morisien mwayen koze, bien souvan mo gagn lenpresion ki li pa get enn problem globalman e souvan li konsantre lor bann lefe enn sitiasion san sey konpran ki lakoz sitiasion la. Nou pran kom lekzanp “MANZE KOUT TRO SER”. Ki dimoun pe dir?
• Pa pe kapav zwenn de bout.
• Gouvernman bizen kontrol pri.
• Gouvernman bizen met sibsid lor manze,
• Planter ek bazarye dominer.
• Malere pe pas boukou mizer.
• Zanfan pe pati.
• Larisi ek so Pouchinn ki pe fane.
Komie Morisien realize ki nou politik ek kiltir alimanter zot bann rezon fondamantal kifer nou dan enn sitiasion danzere? Komie konpran ki nou pa kapav kontinie depann lor manze enporte pou sirviv? Eski enn lepep gagn drwa fie lor manze sort lot kote dilo pou plen so boyo kan li ena sifizaman later, dilo ek memdev pou asir so sekirite alimanter? Tousa, personn pa koze parski zot pa finn aprann al rod LAKOZ PRENSIPAL bez dan lekel zot finn kwense.
Dan nou lang nasional expresion “Lakoz ek Lefe” (cause and effect) pa ekziste parski nou finn pran labitid fokaliz lor lefe e toultan nou rod enn bouk emiser. “Pa mwa sa, li sa” finn vinn nou boukliye enstenktif sak fwa ki ena enn problem kan anverite “nou tou responsab”.
DAN DOMENN POLITIK: Pou bann parti lopozision, ena enn sel lakoz pou tou problem:
• Gouvernman enkonpetan; enn gouvernman faner.
Ki zot ti dir ek fer kan zot ti dan gouvernman?
“Pa koz sa do matlo. Samem ki apel politik.”
DAN DOMENN LEDIKASION: Ki nou tande?
• To finn fel parski to katar. To pares, to pa’le aprann. To bizen pran leson.
Personn pa’le axepte ki nou ena enn politik lengwistik fouka net. Personn pa’le konpran ki ledikasion bazik bizen fer dan lang maternel enn zanfan. Morisien (Kreol Moris) li L1 90% popilasion ek L2 leres 10%.
Ki nou tann dimoun pe dir?
• Profeser pares. Zot okip zis zelev ki pran leson ar zot.
DAN DOMENN RELIZION: Ki nou trouve?
Bann responsab relizie konsantre lor ritiel. Reflexion lor lafwa pa neseser. Souvan zot kasiet laverite parski li zenan. Lafwa ki prensipal finn vinn segonder ek ritiel ki segonder finn vinn prensipal e souvan li konsidere kouma sel valer valab. Seki vizib samem so yes; seki pa vizib kapav pa pran kont.
Eski li drol ki dan lavi sekiler lefe (vizib) finn pran plas lakoz (pa vizib)?
Moris finn desid pou moderniz seki vizib e bliye maladi envizib ki pe ronz nou nam. Nou dan bor enn presipis e nou bann gran panndit politik, ekonomik ek relizie finn desid pou aldelavan. Pa fasil!

LITERACY INSIDE OUT
DEV VIRAHSAWMY
5, Edwin Ythier Street, Rose Hill, 71368, Mauritius
limemsa@gmail.com https://boukiebanane.com
WHY A FEW SUCCEED WHERE MOST FAIL?
Recently, while we were talking about the different aspects of the literacy issue, my son-in-law, Sam Naidoo (65 years old), asked me if I could explain why and how he succeeded in mastering functional literacy and numeracy although his home language was Mauritian Creole (MC) and his parents possessed only a few rudiments of basic literacy and could not be considered literate. I found it a very pertinent question. And I thought about my own history.
I was born in Quartier Militaire of Telugu parents and grew up in Goodlands. Both parents spoke MC, my mother tongue, to each other and to me. My mother, Gouna, was a fan of Ti-Frer and sang his songs to me. I still remember a few lines from the songs:
1. Letan mo ti kontan twa Lilinn
Personn pa ti kone.
Aster mo kit twa, mo ale,
To pik mwa dan zournal.
2. Pa bate li misie,
Ayo mo gran misie!
Li pe koz laverite,
Li pa enn pares,
So saret ti tas dan labou.
3. Charlio, Charli
Aret bwar, aret bwar diven banann!
Dan diven banann ena bebet sizo.
I went to Goodlands Government School and my class was never packed as classes are today. I believe that most pupils were from middle and lower middle-class backgrounds. Very few working-class parents would send their children to school for girls were to help their mothers with household chores and boys were to help their fathers in the field or look after domestic animals. Moreover, teachers were mostly townspeople.
At school, I had to learn to read, write and speak English and French; to know the 11 multiplication tables (table 2 to table 12) from top to bottom and from bottom to top in MC; learn basic Arithmetic; know some geography; and learn good handwriting (penmanship). Teachers not only had small classes to control but they also gave personal-individual (not big group as today) private tuition for a modest fee.
I was a lower middle-class child and very lucky for both parents had mastered basic literacy and numeracy. I had the necessary back up from parents and personal private tutors.
It is to be noted that my paternal grandfather was a ‘sirdar’, in charge of several sugar estate workers; my maternal grandfather was a ‘marker’ (he could read and write basic things such as names, dates and time) and was responsible to keep a register of all workers in his department. Literacy was part of my family culture. Both grandfathers also invested in small businesses successfully and became respected notables in their villages.
School was responsible for the development and prestige of an elite. In the 1970’s, the scene changed dramatically. The authorities decided that schooling should be compulsory for all and parents who do not send their children to school would face legal action. Schools, classes, teachers, and pupils grew in number and size – a good thing in itself – but no thought was given to the need to question ‘medium of instruction’ which remained the same. Working-class and lower working-class children, a great majority in all classes, were totally lost. WHY?
School promoted middle-class culture and working-class and lower working-class children found themselves in an alien environment. Classes became more and more unruly. As examination standard was deliberately lowered to help more children through, the small elite scored very high marks. Moreover, private fee-paying schools started to flourish for middle-class parents wanted something better for their children.
Vote-catching strategies turned a blind eye to real problems. The refusal to use the mother tongue of most Mauritians, i.e. MC, as medium in the initial stage of education, has continued to this day and consequently 70% of the population have remained non-literate and non-numerate. Thousands of kids remain totally non-literate and non-numerate after up to 10 years at school.
ANYTHING WE CAN DO? In a recent article, this is what I proposed.
“Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and ‘Arismetik’ (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.”
Look at this:
TAN EK ASPE/TENSE AND ASPECTS
MC
Prezan: Mo bwar dilo.
Prezan kontinie: Mo pe bwar dilo.
Prezan parfe: Mo finn bwar dilo.
Pase: Mo ti bwar dilo.
Pase kontinie: Mo ti pe bwar dilo.
Pase parfe: Mo ti finn bwar dilo.
Fitir: Mo pou bwar dilo.
Fitir dan pase: Mo ti pou bwar dilo.
ENGLISH
Present tense: I drink water.
Present continuous: I am drinking water.
Present perfect: I have drunk water.
Past tense: I drank water.
Past continuous: I was drinking water.
Past perfect: I had drunk water.
Future: I will drink water.
Future in the past: I would drink water.
The syntactic structures of MC and English are almost identical because English is also a creole language.
Why do we refuse to use resources at our disposal to make of Mauritius the land of FUNCTIONAL-BILINGUAL-LITERACY?

OPEN LETTER TO THE P.M
DEV VIRAHSAWMY

OPEN LETTER TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PRIME MINISTER
NOBLE MINDS FACE FAILURE WITH EQUANIMITY!
Dear Prime Minister,
Allow me to share with you the following observations and thoughts.
As a nation we now invest nearly 20 billion rupees every year on education. Is the money well-spent? In my humble submission, the answer is NO. Why? For more than 50 years, we have focused on quantity in terms of subject matter and accessibility to learning – not a bad thing in itself – but failed to develop national literacy deliberately confusing it with schooling. This appears clearly in the form regularly filled by the ministry of education for UNESCO. As no research has been conducted on literacy, officers simply put down the percentage of children who go to school, assuming that all schooled children do acquire literacy which includes numeracy.
Let us first define literacy. It means the ability to read, write and count. Moreover, there are 3 levels of literacy: basic, functional, and advanced.
• BASIC LITERACY means that the persons concerned can write on themselves a short grammatically correct and well-punctuated text, in the language of their choice, which tells us, in about 150 words, who they are. I think that less than 30% of the population can do this and that 70% of the population can only draw a copy of their names or use their thumb marks.
• FUNCTIONAL LITERACY means “the capacity of a person to engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective function of his or her group and community and also for enabling him or her to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his or her own and the community’s development” (UNESCO Institute for Statistics). It includes information literacy, digital literacy, and media literacy. I believe that a good S.C and H.S.C certificate (O and A level) may ensure functional literacy to holders of these certificates, i.e., about 20% of the population.
• ADVANCED LITERACY is what is required for university studies and professional activities, and it is the prestigious competency of about 10% of the population, an elite which jealously guards and protects its privileges and interests.
I will surely be accused of exaggeration. My answer is very simple: remove party symbols on ballot papers and see what happens.
WHY HAVE WE FAILED?
• In Mauritius we confuse literacy with language learning and mother tongue reality is ignored. First of all, the term ‘mother tongue’ is misunderstood and many think that it means the language of our ancestors (French, Bhojpuri, Tamil, Telugu, Cantonese etc.) or some prestigious languages (Hindi, Urdu, Mandarin Chinese). In fact, it means the language used by parents which a child starts to learn while still in the mother’s womb and the language which the child uses in his/her home and social environment.
• Here are the facts: Morisien/Mauritian (Mauritian Creole) is the mother tongue/first language/L1 of 90% of the population and the second language/L2 of the remaining 10%. It is the best medium to help our children master basic literacy after which they will learn second languages (French, Hindi etc.) more easily. But ignorance, prejudices and hysterical language loyalty are so rife that politicians prefer to avoid the issue.
• English is not only our official language but also the most important international language. Moreover, it is a ‘creole’ language which developed some 1,200 years ago when Vikings invaded England and occupied a large territory. It started as a pidgin and with time became the national/official language of the UK in the 16th-17th centuries and later the language of the British Empire and now it is a quasi-universal language.
• As our national language and our official language are both creole languages which are analytic as opposed to synthetic languages like French, Hindi or Arabic, a sound language policy would make of Mauritius the land of functional-bilingual literacy. Again, because of ignorance, prejudices, and hysterical language loyalty no government has had, so far, the courage to take the bull by the horns.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
Governments have created, to no avail, special classes (PREVOC and Extended Programme) for the thousands of our children who, after 6-10 years at school, remain absolutely non-literate and non-numerate because of a catastrophic language policy which ignores the use of our mother tongue as medium, not to be confused with language as subject.
Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and Arismetik (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.
Brotherly namaste,
Dev

QUO VADIS, ANGREZI?
QUO VADIS, ANGREZI?
THE PAST
More than a thousand years ago, what we call English today started as a ‘pidgin’, a very simplified speech used by Anglo-Saxons and Vikings for basic communication. As interactions between the two peoples developed, the new speech developed at all levels (phonology, syntax and lexis), dropped most inflections and became the mother tongue of a growing number of children. This stage is known as ‘creole’. Then writers entered the picture. The most famous are Chaucer and Shakespeare. When James I sponsored the translation of the Bible into English, that gave an extra boost to the language which eventually became the language of Great Britain.
THE PRESENT
Today, that creole language has become the quasi-universal language. It is the main language of North America, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand; it is the most popular and vibrant language of the Indian Peninsula; it is the lingua franca of the Republic of South Africa (RSA); in Zimbabwe, it is one of the official languages, the main medium of instruction and an indispensable lingua franca; it is the official language of Sierra Leone, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya (together with Swahili), Botswana, Zambia, Rwanda etc. Several Francophone countries where the use of French is on the decline, have joined the Commonwealth of Nations (56 countries) where English is the dominant and active lingua franca. President Macron of France recently stated that he had to admit that French cannot compete with English which is the most commonly used language in the EU. In Vietnam, English has ousted French. In the most prestigious universities of the People’s Republic of China, English is the medium of teaching and research.
What has led to the increasing popularity and prestige of English?
There is a general belief that the English Language has enormously benefitted from British colonialism and US imperialism but I believe that this is not the main reason. Being a creole language, it is not synthetic but analytic. Inflections are very rare. An English verb has a minimum of 3 forms (cut, cuts, cutting); regular verbs have 4 forms (work, works, working, worked); irregular verbs have 5 forms (eat, eats, eating, ate, eaten). A French verb has dozens of forms. The present tense alone of the verb ‘manger’, has 5 forms: mange, manges, mangeons, mangez and mangent. English adjectives have only one form: a beautiful child, a beautiful flower, beautiful children and flowers, a beautiful house etc. In French an adjective has several forms: un beau pays, un bel homme, une belle fille, des beaux yeux, des belles femmes. A full contrastive analysis will show the difficulty faced by learners of French as a foreign language.
THE FUTURE
With globalisation, the internet, growing use of IT and travelling facilities, the planet is shrinking into a big village and in this global village, people are in greater need for a basic medium of ‘border-crossing’, cross-cultural communication (L2). Synthetic languages like French or Hindi have no chance of winning the communication battle. Countries will opt for the universal creole lingua franca which English (L2) is, together with their local national language (L1) which defines national identity. To succeed, languages like French or Hindi must eat the humble pie and opt as languages of culture to be mastered as foreign languages or L3.
In the Maritime Republic of Mauritius, we are very fortunate to have as L1 Mauritian and Rodriguan and English as L2. These are 3 creole languages. The acquisition of L1 literacy (Mauritian or Rodriguan) will pave the way to quick and successful L2 literacy (English). Creole languages have syntactic similarities which facilitate the mastery of English.
To illustrate this, let us have a quick look at the tense and aspect structure of Mauritian and English:
Present tense: Mo manze. / I eat.
Present progressive: Mo pe manze. / I am eating.
Present perfective: Mo finn manze. / I have eaten.
Past tense: Mo ti manze. / I ate.
Past progressive: Mo ti pe manze. / I was eating.
Past perfective: Mo ti finn manze. / I had eaten.
Future tense: Mo pou manze. / I will eat.
Past in future: Mo ti pou manze si … / I would eat if …
If we are wise enough to use properly our cultural resources, we can make of our republic a model in the fight against illiteracy and poverty. And the cherry on the cake will be mastery of a third language.
This is not blah-blah-blah. This is not a discourse on the sex of angels. A course in literacy and numeracy which I mounted with the help of the Catholic Church and which used Mauritian as main medium and English as L2 was very successful and won a Commonwealth award. 200 children who had failed CPE (year 6) twice were taken on board. After 3 years, over 75% passed the National Examination Certificate (year 9). All of them are now skilled workers and literate citizens.
I would not be surprised that in a not-too-distant future, Reunion decides to invest more in the acquisition of English.
Madagascar, a neighbour of RSA and a country with strong links with the creole islands in the Indian Ocean (Seychelles, Reunion, Mauritius, Rodrigues) will certainly benefit from some command of English, the language of international trade.
Is that idle dreaming? Time will tell.

Mezon-edision, Boukie Banane,
Ti vinn neseser pou reponn prezan
Kan enn nouvo souf dan lang innyore
Nasion Morisien ti pe pran lelan.
Dan so koumansman, li ti pe servi
Tayprayter, stennsil ek diplikater
Pou enn ti piblik ki ti pe anvi
Bwar literatir dan lang popiler.
Sa lantrepriz la finn res familial
Ek artizanal depi inisial
Ena senkant an, ziska azordi.
Teknolozi finn permet li tini
– lekritir ek lenprimri dizital –
Malgre prezize ki pe rod touy li.

RAHA HOSPITAL
CURE WITH LOVE AND CARE
(For my sister Dr Indu and Brother Dr Jijil)
At the age of three, in 1945, polio robbed me of my left arm. I have since been living with only one arm and have struggled through with some success. But in 2017, at the age of 75, I developed Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS). I was made to understand that I should be prepared to end my last few days in a wheelchair.
Then a miracle happened. A force beyond my control opened a new door and I found myself in RAHA Hospital in Bamboo Lagoon Ayurveda Village. A FABULOUS PLACE!
Everything was different from what I had experienced before. There were smiling, loving and caring people from top to bottom, be they top medical specialists, nursing personnel, physiotherapists, Ayurveda massage professionals, kitchen-garden-cleaning staff.
After less than 2 weeks I started to sit, stand and walk squarely and straight without much discomfort. I started to feel like a new man. In fact, I had become a new man in both posture and outlook.
Raha Bamboo Lagoon Ayurveda Village is not only beautiful and comfortable as it stands by Kerala backwater, a superb lake. It is also a place where patients are offered food which is simply out of this world.
At the end of my treatment, I was given health instructions to maintain mind, body and spirit in good balance. Moreover, I was provided with medication for 3 months with the possibility of fresh purchase, if needed.
To ensure proper monitoring and update, Loga, my wife, and I have decided in favour of regular visits.
                                             Raha, to finn rant dan mo douniya
                                             Pou efas mo larm e donn mwa lazwa.
                                             (Raha, you have entered my little world
                                            To wipe all my tears and make me cheerful.)
JAI RAHA HOSPITAL!
31.08.22
THERE IS A PLACE
There is a place where
Brain-damaged Baby Alia
Has learnt to smile.
There is a place where
MS Abir gets
Loving care
From manly Omar.
There is a place where
An ordinary manual worker
Keeps the garden
Beautiful and healthy
As a devoted and loyal soldier
In the army of love.
There is a place where
80 yr old PPS patient
Has learnt to watch
His sun go down
In complete serenity
For Ayurveda
Has won the battle against pains.
There is a place …
And the place
IS
RAHA.

Mo bizen dir twa mersi:
To finn grandi mo lespri,
Fer mwa konpran nou isi
Nou bizen san partipri
Aprann viv annarmoni.

THE GREATEST OF THEM ALL
If The Old Testament did trigger the tragic vision leading to sorrow, despair and separation, The New Testament, on the other hand, brought about a comic vision based on solidarity, sharing, reconciliation and reunion. Both together helped to develop a tragi-comic vision in which the tragic potentials are neutralised by what William Blake called ‘Mercy, Pity, Peace and Love’ in his poem THE DIVINE IMAGE.
To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
All pray in their distress;
And to these virtues of delight
Return their thankfulness.
For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
Is God, our father dear,
And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
Is Man, his child and care.
For Mercy has a human heart,
Pity a human face,
And Love, the human form divine,
And Peace, the human dress.
Then every man, of every clime,
That prays in his distress,
Prays to the human form divine,
Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.
And all must love the human form,
In heathen, Turk, or Jew;
Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell
There God is dwelling too.
Two tragicomedies I love specially are The Tempest and Winter’s Tale by the Great Bard, William Shakespeare. My friends will remember that The Tempest inspired me to write Toufann in my mother tongue (https://boukiebanane.com) and now it also exists in English, French and Japanese.
If in lay literature tragicomedies are very important sources of education and entertainment, I have always thought that the most poignant tragicomic moment is found in a religious literature classic, The New Testament.
When Jesus knows he is about to die on the cross, he goes through a very brief moment of ‘DEEP DESPAIR’ (And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” Matthew 27:46) only to realise that the essence of life is, to quote William Blake, ‘Mercy, Pity, Peace and Love’. Jesus, the avatar of Vishnu, then said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” (Luke 23:34)
For me this is the greatest tragicomic moment in the history of ‘mankind’. AND JESUS IS THE GREATEST TRAGICOMIC HERO OF ALL TIMES. AND HE IS ALSO MY GOD.

ON COMMISSIONS OF ENQUIRY
ANOTHER COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY?

Why do opposition parties, leaders and members have such an infatuation for commissions of enquiry? Please note that the same parties, leaders and members never toy with this device when in power. WHY?
A commission of enquiry is a time, energy and resource consuming activity whose findings and conclusions, though not legally binding, may be highly influential. People in power think it is either a waste of time or an efficient form of delaying tactic; the same people, when in opposition, find in it a good and, at times, a powerful means to titillate our yen for the gossipy and the sensational.
ON 3 IMPORTANT ISSUES
Instead of commissions of enquiry to look into issues which can easily be dealt with by a departmental enquiry, let us have commissions of enquiry on vital issues which governments and oppositions prefer to shy away from.
• ON FOOD SECURITY: – 1. How to replace imported staples by home grown ones? 2. How to produce meat without releasing methane? 3. How to produce seafood in a green environment? 4. How to promote healthy eating and combat diabetes and obesity?
• ON LITERACY: – Why do we need party symbols on our ballot papers? Why is our literacy rate so low when billions are spent every year? What is to be done?
• ON NATIONAL IDENTITY: – How to develop a supra-ethnic national identity alongside ethnic loyalties?
ENQUIRY ON ENQUIRY
If you are still keen on petty enquiries, let’s have a commission of enquiry on commissions of enquiry.

1980’s: WHY I DID IT
1980’S: WHY I DID IT!
You may call me traitor or ‘vander lalit’, my pet name in most MMM households (if there are any left!). Being quite ill with Post-Polio Syndrome, I will soon have to leave you but before I go, let me share with you the way I see things and I will understand if you think that the MMM or MSM version is the truth.
The 1982 general ‘balye-karo-60-zero’ elections brought to power Aneerood Jugnauth as Prime Minister, Harish Boodhoo as Deputy Prime Minister, and Paul Raymond Berenger as Finance Minister. One evening I saw on TV the finance minister PRB snatch the microphone from PM AJ’s hand while the latter was addressing journalists in an official press conference. The ‘kolom-lapropriyete’ (kolom=steward; lapropriyete=estate) mentality was raising its ugly head again. I, a co-founder of the MMM, left the party because the kolom-lapropriyete PRB cannot accept people who do not think like him and thinks that MMM is his estate. Is this not the main cause of the downfall of a party which in the early 70’s became the symbol of hope and progressive change, and which now has become only a pale shadow of its former self? N’en déplaise à Bhagwan et consort! The microphone snatching incident was revelatory. 6o Zero government was in shambles and soon split with AJ and HB on one side and PRB on the other. My mind was made. The ‘kolom’ must be taught that Mauritius is not his ‘lapropriyete’.
New general elections were to be expected and the new MSM took the defunct MMMSP symbol (the sun). I had a serious conversation with the then PM on the importance of Morisien, the national language of Mauritius and the need to fight communalism by developing a supra-ethnic culture on which nationhood could be built. He told me that he agreed with me, and I joined him in the fight against kolom-lapropriyete. The MSM won and I was appointed Culture Adviser, attached to the Ministry of Education and for 3-4 years, I devoted myself to the organisation of major events such as independence celebrations, theatre and music festivals, literary competitions and The International Sea Festival which gave a tremendous boost to creativity and tourism.
During those 3-4 years I also made many enemies besides MMM hatred. Harish Boodhoo and his socio-cultural acolytes saw in my work a threat to their Indianness and to counter my work on Mauritian they rode their Bhojpuri hobbyhorse. The Prime Minister finally sided with them and completely reneged on our agreement to build a national language.
It was a blessing in disguise. After almost 20 years in the political field, I decided to concentrate my energy on building a national literature in the de-facto national language (thousands of poems, dozens of plays, hundreds of papers, and numerous pieces of literary prose). My work can be freely accessed on:  https://boukiebanane.com
I’ve had a good life.
Mersi Bondie!
Mersi Loga!

ON PATRIARCHY
LET US BE MORE HUMAN AND FIGHT ‘PRICK-POWER’!
Recently there has been a general outcry against generalised gender violence which has even culminated into loss of lives. Let it be made clear at the outset that 99.9% of victims are females and 99.9% of perpetrators are males. N’en déplaise à certains who want to believe that men and women are equally responsible. Machos whose brain is found between their legs should be advised to belt up and stop making fools of themselves. Mental bins are too good for them.
A good thing is that the discussion has gone public and both men and women are willing to talk about this openly. But unfortunately, the focus has been more on EFFECT and not on CAUSE.
No real solution will be found if we continue to turn a blind eye on the fundamental cause which is PATRIARCHY.
WHAT IS PATRIARCHY?
Patriarchy is a social system in which positions of dominance and privilege are primarily held by men. Like all systems, patriarchy generates its own ideology which sustains and promotes the system. Patriarchal ideology is present in all fields of life. Here are some examples:
• The new-born son is ‘premie lo’ (first prize);
• In some ethnic cultures a daughter is ‘a burden’ as a dowry (dahej) has to be provided to secure a husband for her;
• God has a beard; He is ‘Father’ in Heaven;
• In many religions women are not ordained as priest;
• The bride is expected to be ‘a virgin’ and there must be blood spots on the nuptial sheet;
• In some religions, a man may have several wives;
• LGBTQ people are harassed, persecuted, tortured and murdered etc.
It is not true to say that patriarchy is ‘GOD-ORDAINED’. There has been and there are still matriarchal and matrilineal societies. Don’t forget that Princess Draupadi, heroine of the Mahabharata, had 5 husbands and that Queen Kunti, after the death of her husband, showed great political acumen.
THE SITUATION TODAY
If in the past, daughters were not entitled to any inheritance; were not sent to school; did not have the right to vote or stand as candidates; were not allowed to work outside the home etc. the situation has much changed. With the passage of time, more and more women have climbed the professional and social ladder to reach the top. In many fields, they are doing better than men. GENDER EQUALITY is now the order of the day. Enlightened men have no problem with this but machos are not prepared to accept the fact that, although different, women and men are equal. As it was quite rightly pointed out by Pope Francis, the story of Adam and Eve is a fable for children, but ‘machismo’ teaches imbeciles that Eve was made with one of Adam’s ribs. So, a woman is bound to be inferior.
When two equal human beings live as a couple, there will be moments of tension because they may not see things in the same way. The solution is a civilised discussion based on facts and logic and not on one imposing his or her will on the other. Unfortunately, many men are not prepared to accept this. When they cannot find arguments to defend their views, they resort to violence and the law of the jungle where MIGHT IS RIGHT.
CONCLUSION
Humanity has known matriarchy and patriarchy and we are aware of the limits of both systems. It is not a question of replacing phallocracy by vaginocracy. We must now strive to build gender equality which includes recognition of LGBTQ reality. LET US BE MORE HUMAN AND FIGHT ‘PRICK-POWER’!

THE ROAD TO DISCOVERY
THE WAY I SEE IT
PART 1
EARLY DAYS
It’s incredible! Suddenly I remember the way I was brought up in both Goodlands and Quartier Militaire.
In Goodlands, I mixed up with only my cousins and other close relatives and not with other neighbours who were either ‘Kalkitas’ or ‘Kreol Mazanbik’. Most of the people in my street were either my father’s siblings or cousins and their families and relatives. My grandfather (Tata Ganganah), the eldest member of his generation, was the much respected and obeyed patriarch. He ruled the tribe. Yes, I grew up in a Telugu tribe. Tata Ganganah saw himself as the God-ordained Guardian of our blood-purity. This is why when my father, in his late teens had fathered a child with a Kreolinn (an Afro-Creole woman), he was ordered to cut all links with that woman and was quickly married to my mother, a ‘genuine’ Telugu girl from Quartier Militaire. This is also why, when one of my sisters fell in love with a ‘Madras’ (Tamil) boy – a friend of mine – and I publicly gave them my full support, my Tata declared me a renegade to be ‘banished’.
The story of my father’s first love and first child was hidden from us although my mother frequently, when she was angry with me, told me to go to ‘to fami, lao laba’ (your family uphill). Much later, with the help of my great cousin, Sanass, I established contact with my half-sister, Monol.
In Quartier Militaire, the situation was different. On Bonne Veine Road, my grandparents were the only Telugus and they were forced to mix with non-Telugus. There, my best friend was Farook Aumeer, a Muslim boy.
In the 1950’s, my Tata bought a big house in Trotter Street, Beau-Bassin and as my mother had died in childbirth (8th child), most of my siblings were able to live under the same roof with my Babam (Tata’s wife, my father’s mother) and two aunts, Appa Narain and Appa Vidya.
The new situation opened the door to new experiences.
A NEW WORLD
Electricity. Running water. Telephone. Tarred streets. Street lighting. A new world.
We were the only Telugus on Trotter Street. There were middle-class and lower middle-class Whites, Creoles, Muslims and Mulattoes and one family of lower middle class Kalkitas.
No sugarcane fields. But a beautiful public garden by a waterfall close by. On the streets, Bhojpuri was totally absent. Only Creole and some French.
I underwent a great cultural change. I completed my primary education in a Catholic school (St. Enfant Jesus) after which I went to a Catholic secondary school (St. Joseph’s College). My father and grandparents were sure that I would get a very good education. They were right. But they did not suspect that this would also mean a change in mindset. I became an Elvis Presley and James Dean fan; went regularly to Roxy, Plaza and Royal cinema halls to watch French films and Hollywood films dubbed in French; started to sing American songs; I even wrote lyrics in English and tried to put them to music. My Babam was worried and said I had become a ‘Konndorrou’, her word for Creole.
All my friends were lower middle-class creoles and this terrified Babam for she though that Creole girls would snare me into marriage. What she did not know was that most of them thought I was a ‘malbar bitasion’ (a derogatory term for village Hindus) and moreover, my handicap due to polio did not make of me a worthwhile catch.
If she only knew how much my secondary education had changed me! In several ways.
• Hindu religious rituals were meaningless for me. I found Catholic rituals more attractive. Worse. My parents and grandparents had failed to impart to me the essence of Hinduism; in fact, rituals had taken the place of faith.
• By the Creoles, mulattoes and ‘Ti-Blan’, i.e., not wealthy whites – (Gran Blan – wealthy whites sent their children to boarding schools in Apartheid South Africa) – I was mockingly called a ‘zangarna’ (worshipper of Jagannath, another name for Vishnu and Krishna). As I knew nothing about my ancestral religion, I had to simply shut up. But great was the humiliation.
• My spoken French was poor for I could not pronounce certain phonemes, specially [ə] as in ‘le’, [œ] as in ‘coeur’, [ø] as in ‘voeu’, [ʃ] as in ‘chance’, [ʒ] as in ‘jamais’ or ‘visage’ etc. These phonemes are not used by my mother tongue, Mauritian Creole. Again, I was the object of mockery. Fortunately, I had a good ear and with great efforts, I overcame my limitation and eventually mastered the phonology of French and won an Alliance Franҁaise prize. That helped me to command respect.
Babam was right. I had become a ‘konndorrou’. A very happy one. Being a Hindu or a Telugu meant nothing to me. Then I met Loga, a Port Louis Telugu girl and my life changed again.
LOVE AND MARRIAGE
When we met, she was 17 and I was 19-20. Something attracted us to each other. She was not considered as beautiful as her elder sister or as intelligent as her younger sister but her personality generated a lot of kindness. Her father, Samy Mulleegadoo, was a founder member of the Mauritius Andhra Maha Sabha, an association which looked after the rights and welfare of Telugus and his wife, known by all as Madam Samy, was a ‘choli’ specialist (a special blouse worn with a saree). On Loga’s side, I was warmly welcome. On my side there was plenty of opposition. Why? I could not understand.
Loga and I were sure that we were made for each other and we decided to ignore those who were against our union. When they understood that we would act according to our will, they reluctantly accepted to be present at our official betrothal. As I had to leave for Edinburgh University, Loga and I decided that she would save some money to come to UK. We were helped by Loga’s uncle, Seemat, who organised our wedding in England.
We have known each other for almost 60 years now. We have 2 daughters, Saskia and Anushka, and 3 grandchildren: Taz, 25 yrs. old; Yann, 24 yrs. old and Rachel, 20 yrs. old. Together we have built something very beautiful. Saskia, an accountant, has moved to paramedical activities, specialising in aqua therapy; Anushka, a graphic designer, is now running a home for battered women and manages the Gender Links branch of Mauritius. Taz did a first degree in psychology and now aims at becoming a professional singer; Yann is a forensic accountant and Rachel is an interior designer. Loga, a gender equality militant, has now successfully turned to creative writing. Our lives together have been a marvelous voyage à deux with all the ups and downs of loving togetherness.
PART 2
EDINBURGH
Besides a degree in English and French and a diploma in Applied Linguistics; besides the artistic delight of Edinburgh Festival; besides the friendship of Sue, Irene, Heather, Paul and Mick, Edinburgh has equipped me with knowledge on feminism, political thoughts and creole languages, knowledge which has greatly fueled my life since.
I discovered feminism first through an interpretation of Lady Macbeth by my personal English literature tutor and a sort of surrogate mother, Madeleine Ly Tio Fane, who told me that the truly tragic character in Macbeth was Lady Macbeth who sacrificed her life and soul to help her husband. Further knowledge came from plays by Henrik Ibsen and Bernard Shaw and through friends, male and female. Loga and I did our best to make of feminism an important aspect of our conjugal life. I think we have been rather successful.
Through friends, I learnt about Quakerism, Anarchism, socialist revolution; I was quite close to a group which was militating for Scottish home-rule. I must admit I was quite naïve, politically speaking, and had to grow through practice which would start in 1968.
Before I left Mauritius, twice I raised the Creole language question, suggesting that it was the language of Mauritius and both times I was politely told by my elders that it was broken French, a pidgin, a dialect and NOT a language. As I was not intellectually equipped to explain my intuition or defend my belief, I chose silence.
After an average performance during my first university year and was admitted to yr. 2, the head of the Faculty of English asked to see me in his office. He wanted to know more about my language skills. When he asked me what language I spoke at home, I stammered and repeated what my elders had told me about the Creole language. He stopped me gently to say that Creole was a language and consequently I knew 4 languages (Creole, English, French and Latin). That short interview got me very excited about future academic work. But as the excitement subsided, the language project sank at the back of my mind. I got very interested in economic studies, known at that time as political economy and started to plan a double-degree. A set of unforeseen circumstances forced me to drop that plan and suddenly the old idea of creole studies rose to the surface. I knew that Edinburgh University had a post-graduate diploma in Applied Linguistics which would allow me to specialise in the teaching of English and write a dissertation on a related subject. Was I qualified for the course? I went to see the Director, Dr. Pit Corder, who told me that it was too late to apply but he would see what could be done as a student had just dropped out. He talked on the phone to someone, smiled and told me that I could have the place. I was just very lucky.
My mind was made up. My dissertation would be on the revaluation of Mauritian Creole and its use to develop literacy and numeracy and to build a national culture.
POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT
Loga and I returned to Mauritius in 1967, a few weeks before the general elections which were to ‘decide’ on the future of my homeland. The two protagonists were MLP (Mauritius Labour Party) which was campaigning in favour of independence and the PMSD (Parti Mauricien Social Démocrate) which was against independence and was proposing that the Mauritius archipelago be made a British Overseas Territory. The sad truth is that both belligerents were lying to the people.
• The Mauritian delegation in the pre-independence talks had already agreed on the excision of the Diego Archipelago which would become an American military base;
• Military strategists in the UK were already thinking of pulling out of East of Suez;
• It was not the policy of the Labour Party under the leadership of Harold Wilson to create overseas territories.
The 1967 campaign was ugly in several ways. One the one hand, there were great promises for a better life for ‘swaraj’ would benefit the poor for there would be a land reform and nationalisation would take from the rich to give to the poor. On the other hand, there was a campaign based on hatred and fear. The country was split into two (56% for independence and 44% against) along ethnic lines with Hindus in general on one side and non-Hindus in general on the other. I realised that bridging the social, cultural and political gap would be a Herculean task. Perhaps Mauritian Creole could help us in this mammoth endeavour. Rightly or wrongly, this is what I thought.
As soon as the results of the 1967 general elections were known, I started a series of articles in l’Express on the nature and importance of Mauritian Creole which should be renamed ‘Morisien’ (Mauritian). That was 55 years ago.
A group of young Mauritians who had started an association which they called “Club des Etudiants Mauriciens”, contacted me to invite me to join their club, which I did.
Less than a year later, a young Mauritian intellectual fresh from a Canadian university contacted me and asked if he could meet me to discuss some issues. This is how I came to know Jooneed Jeerubarkhan. A few weeks later, it was the turn of Paul Berenger to meet me to express his appreciation of my work. The MMM seed was planted then and over a period of roughly 14 years, it became a very powerful party with the help of Anerood Jugnauth and Harris Boodhoo. It reached its zenith in 1982 and then started to decline and now it is just a shadow of its own self.
CREATIVE WRITING
Although I did some creative writing between 1967 and 1971, it was in 1972, while in prison, that the creative writing urge became dominant. Over a period of 50 years (1972-2022), I must have written about 3,000 poems, about 20 short stories, about 40 plays, 5 novellas and 1 novel; I have translated into Mauritian 9 plays by William Shakespeare; works by Molière, Lafontaine, Prévert, Keats, Blake, T.S.Eliot etc. Besides lay literature, I have also translated religious literature: pages from the Bible and the Holy Koran; the Bhagavad-Gita, the Upanishads etc.
To promote literacy and numeracy, I have written hundreds of articles and dozens of training materials.
Now ill-health (PPS) forces me to slow down considerably and concentrate on alleviating discomfort and pains. I was told by doctors that I would end up on a wheelchair, a damning perspective. Fortunately, thanks to MS Anna Blackwood, a friend of my daughter, Saskia, I heard about Raha Bamboo Lagoon Ayurveda Village and there I learnt to face my dilemma. I feel much better now.
TO CONCLUDE
As my sun is getting closer to the horizon, I find that the dream of a progressive and eco-friendly Mauritius is getting stronger. Moreover, my belief that Jesus is an avatar of Vishnu gives me the assurance that one day soon, more people will become convinced that bridges can be built to connect the different religions of the world.

PLANT ENN PIE FRIYAPEN
Kan mo ler finn vini,
Pa kapav rod tini,
Pa bizen sanbrani,
Kanf ousa labouzi.
Pa bizen zot sagren;
Plant enn pie friyapen.
Knock, knock!
He’s here.
Forget rituals
And offerings.
No, no, don’t be blue!
A breadfruit tree will do.
Bliye zot bouke fler,
Lapriyer, larm senser,
Zes parfwa neseser,
Nek mazinn koze yer.
Pa bizen zot sagren;
Plant enn pie friyapen.
Forget it, forget it!
Flowers, prayers
And sorrowful tears.
Remember what was said.
No, no, don’t be blue!
A breadfruit tree will do.
Mo kone bien souvan
Mo ti soul mo bontan;
Souvan mo ti kontan
Fer kouma servolan.
Pa bizen zot sagren;
Plant enn pie friyapen.
Often, I know
I just had it fine
Dangling about
Importunately.
No, no, don’t be blue!
A breadfruit tree will do.
Mem kan mo ti fane
Mo ti kwar mo’enn serye;
Me mo nam bien kone
Kot li bizen ale.
Pa bizen zot sagren;
Plant enn pie friyapen.
Even when I erred
I thought it right
But my soul does know
Which body to inherit.
No, no, don’t be blue!
A breadfruit tree will do.

THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG
Regularly, at least 3 times a year, people in Mauritius, be they politicians, school administrators, teachers or parents, get very excited about exam results. Recriminations on the one hand and self-congratulations on the other abound. We focus on the little visible bit and ignore the large hideous hidden chunk.
Recently, we were told that a record number of our teenagers had passed the H.S.C exams. What does this mean? Did the 5,000 or so teenagers obtain 3 ‘main’, 1 ‘sub’ and G.P and so had a ‘full certificate’? What does a ‘scrape through’ pass mean in terms of performance per subject or as a whole? The record high pass rate is like a bikini which shows what we don’t want to see and hides what we want to see. About 8 years before that event, about 25,000 children took the 6th grade exams. It means that during a period 8 years, 20,000 children dropped out. Most of them are either semi-literate or non-literate and non-numerate. We celebrate the performance of some 5,000 and turn a blind eye on the agony, frustration and humiliation of 20,000. Is this our definition of civilisation and development? What are the prospects of these young citizens who do not possess a fundamental and indispensable tool to perform well in the modern world? What is that tool? Literacy and numeracy. What does it mean? The ability to read, write and count. Does this mean the ability to use a phone? NO. To use a phone, all you need to know is 0 to 9. That is not literacy or numeracy. Does it mean to be able to sign your name? NO. You may learn to draw your name without being literate,
What is literacy then? It is the ability to say in writing, in at least ONE language, who you are in about 150 words, in sentences which are grammatically correct, well-punctuated and well-connected.
Regularly UNESCO asks governments of all countries to give their literacy rates. All the governments of Mauritius have repeatedly lied to that international organisation by deliberately confusing literacy with schooling. The official figure of about 85% in fact means that 85% of Mauritian children attend school.
Although schools are accessible and free, the real literacy rate is around 30%. Why is that so?
Even quite normal children growing up in highly developed countries have difficulties to acquire reading and writing skills. Why? Because humans have in the brain an area known as Broca’s area which helps the development of speech – oral skills – BUT there is no known area which helps us to manage literacy. Neurolinguists think that learning to read and write means that learners must create a bridge between their Broca’s area and their visual cortex. This, in normal conditions where learners must learn to read and write their mother tongue, is a difficult task. The situation becomes very complex if learners must do this in a foreign language. In Mauritius our children are forced to learn literacy skills in 2 and in some cases 3 foreign languages. As long as people think that this is good, there will be no change. Teachers also love this for there are jobs for the boys and girls and Mass Tuition Co. Ltd. thrives.
SINCE MAURITIAN AND ENGLISH ARE BOTH CREOLE LANGUAGES SHARING GREAT SYNTACTIC SIMILARITIES, BILINGUAL LITERACY (in Mauritian and English) CAN LEAD TO A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH.
Change will come only when parents by the thousands stand up, raise their voices and make clear claims for genuine change.
When will it happen? Kan poul gagn ledan? No, not really if Curtin decides to step in.

A FEW THINGS TO REMEMBER
We are here concerned with 2 species of the genus ‘cannabis’: that which yields THC and is considered a drug and that which yields CBD, an effective medication to help us face a series of pathologies.
It must be remembered that THC cannabis is illegal although it is less dangerous than tobacco and alcohol which are legal. I am sure that you understand why.
We will call CBD cannabis ‘INDUSTRIAL CANNABIS’. It is also known as hemp.
“Hemp, or industrial hemp, is a botanical class of Cannabis sativa cultivars grown specifically for industrial or medicinal use. It can be used to make a wide range of products. Along with bamboo, hemp is among the fastest growing plants on Earth. It was also one of the first plants to be spun into usable fiber 50,000 years ago. It can be refined into a variety of commercial items, including paper, rope, textiles, clothing, biodegradable plastics, paint, insulation, biofuel, food, and animal feed.” (Wikipedia)
How effective is CBD?
According to a 2018 study (MEDICAL NEWS TODAY), reasons for taking CBD oil include:
• chronic pain
• arthritis or joint pain
• anxiety and depression
• sleep disorder
• migraine
• cluster and other headaches
• post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
• nausea
• cancer
• allergies or asthma
• epilepsy and other seizure disorders
• multiple sclerosis (MS)
• lung conditions
• Parkinson’s disease
• Alzheimer’s disease
To this list I will also add PPS (post-polio-syndrome)
GO GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE
This very fast-growing plant can be harvested 3-4 times per year and will definitely reduce imports of several commodities including cement, textile fibres, fossil fuels, wood and food.
I understand that big, medium and small planters are keen to invest in that field. Why do we dilly-dally?
CHOMBO, NAPA LES SAPE
Nou gardmanze vid; planet dan dife; klima finn gagn kriz; bizen enterdi lenerzi fosil; nou lagrikiltir bizen sanz vizaz; nou bizen later pou plant kanabis ki donn CBD.
Apart CBD ki pou ed nou tou ki soufer douler PPS, artrit, rematis, kanser, depresion, migrenn, asma, HIV, douler reg ek menopoz … Kanabis endistriyel donn nou materyo pou lenerzi ver, lendistri textil, lendistri lakord, lendistri konstriksion.
Eh Fatra, ki to pe atann?
(We need food-security; fight global burning, climate crisis; use green energy; revamp our agriculture and grow hemp to produce CBD and raw materials for different industries. You fool! What are you waiting for?)
Chombo li la,
Chombo li.
Chombo li,
Napa les li sape!
(Fanfan)

THE IZNOGOUD GENERATION
PAR TRAPVANTRIYE
there was once a dream
of equality
then came IZNOGOUD
and nightmare crept in
Absolute equality may be a crazy idea but it was thought that teamwork, solidarity and sharing could make a better world. The rigid power hierarchy of ‘feudocapitalism’ commonly known as neo-feudalism, based on money, status and power is definitely repugnant and inhuman but this is how the world is organised. This is what is perceived as civilisation. But is it? Can we go on with unequal rights and unequal legal protections for common people and for nobility, dominance of societies by small and powerful elite groups of society, and relations of lordship and serfdom between the rich elite and the poor people? There have been attempts to change but we must admit that “plus ҁa change, plus c’est la même chose” (the more things change, the more they stay the same).
For Iznogouds, there is no place for love, care, friendship, generosity or gratitude. Their motto is: KILL, KILL, KILL! TAKE, TAKE, TAKE!
Their bloated egos know no bounds.
They are like monsters of the deep preying on each other (King Lear, Act 4 Sc 2).
Did Christ die in vain?

REFIZ TAS DERYER MIDI!
DON’T MISS YOUR CHANCE, ‘CHOMBO LI’!
Wisdom tells us to get our priorities right and not waste time beating about the bush, a favourite hobby of most Mauritians. We do have many serious problems to face and tackle and yet we prefer to focus on some detail and look elsewhere.
• When world thinkers are warning us that the boundary of global warming and climate change has been crossed and we are now in the disastrous territory of GLOBAL BURNING & CLIMATE CRISIS, our political and economic leaders are still thinking in terms of economic GLOBALISATION and CLASSICAL BEACH TOURISM. The time has come to explore new venues such as LOCALISATION and GREEN & CULTURE TOURISM.
This means inter alia:
(1) that south-east Africa, Madagascar and the creole islands of the south-west Indian Ocean (The Seychelles, Reunion, Agalega, Mauritius and Rodrigues) would be well advised to strengthen their economic, political and cultural ties and learn to cooperate for the benefit of one and all;
(2) that we should join forces to build nonpolluting electric ships using photo-voltaic ‘sails’;
(3) besides their local/national languages, the citizens of this group should be made functionally literate in English which is already official in several countries of the group and is also the world lingua franca (universal);
(4) these countries must invest in IT literacy which will promote communication, understanding and sharing;
(5) green and culture tourism within the group will enhance friendship and solidarity;
(6) in Mauritius and other countries of the group, it is high time that we earnestly start to plant or replant mangrove forests along the coasts to ensure a good supply of seafood for ourselves and our neighbours.
FOOD SECURITY
Instead of paying lip service to the concept of food security, let us see what it should mean. It basically means TWO things:
(1) Grow what you eat and eat what you grow;
(2) Eat healthy.
We should not depend on imported basic staples such as rice and wheat flour. We should develop a new cuisine or food-culture based on breadfruit, potato, sweet potato, corn, cassava, arrow root, jackfruit etc. If our neighbours can sell us some rice or wheat flour, well and good. These are to be consumed on special occasions and not considered as a ‘sine qua non’ for daily consumption.
Over 40% of our population are overweight if not plainly obese; over 30% are diabetic or prone to diabetes. Why, you may ask? Simple answer: over consumption of sugar and fat and sedentary lifestyle. Nou mari kontan gonaz (we adore eating rubbish) ek plak nou deryer (and sit on our arse). Our food culture must change, so must our lifestyle. We have to move from petrol power to muscle power.
THE LANGUAGE ISSUE
Our refusal to address this issue out of an absurd form of loyalty to some supposed ancestral language has dramatic, not to say catastrophic, consequences. Less than 30% of the overall population are fully literate and numerate although primary, secondary and tertiary education are free and accessible. Why? The mother tongue (Mauritian) of 90% of the population and the second language of the remaining 10% is not used as medium for basic literacy and numeracy. Moreover, political leaders and educators don’t seem to know that because English is also a creole language with great syntactic similarities with Mauritian, the passage from Mauritian to English, if properly tackled, can lead to quick and smooth mastery of the republic’s official language and the world’s lingua franca. When the national language (Mauritian) and the official language (English) are well mastered, a third or fourth language can more easily be mastered.
WHO WILL BELL THE CAT?
The suggestions made in this opinion piece are not vote-catching and consequently we will have to wait for global catastrophe, poverty and famine for tenrecs (‘tang’ in Mauritian) to open their eyes. But it will be too late. In the meantime, the plundering of the planet will continue and at the same time some plunderers are hoping to find other celestial bodies to plunder.
The destruction of one planet is not enough. Our appetite for material wealth and pillage knows no end.
The SUPER RICH don’t care as long as they have a chance of becoming “The Richest”. There is no competition in this world to become “THE KINDEST”.
TO CONCLUDE
This may be day-dreaming. I am not practical in the mundane sense of the word. AND I DON’T CARE! The precious, beautiful, life-giving and life-sustaining Blue Planet, created by Brahma, must be saved and can be saved.
Let us not end up as dinosaurs wearing rupee spectacles!

Parski li ti vinn enn konndorou .
Me ti ena enn ti konpansasion:
Li ti pas sinior ek echesi;

Plis extra: pri Lalians Fransez …
Li ti pe fer loner fami
Dan vilaz kouma dan lavil.
Pez nene bwar dilwil!
Zot ti onte ek fier anmemtan.
San kone, li ti fini vinn enn metis
Dan so manier panse ek so manier viv.
Li ti atire par tifi bannla,
Pa par tifi so bann
Ziska ki enn zour
Enn regar travers so lizie pou vinn tous mwa.
De nam-torsennkole ti zwenn.

Enn tifi ordiner
Ki pou vinn extraordiner
Pa zis dan so lavi
Me dan lavi boukou dimoun.
Enn zour, san atann,

Ti anbras li.
Depi sa zour la li ti aret kasiet
Lame zouzout dan so pos.

E pou ouver laport literasi
Pou tou dimoun.

METAFOR
(METAPHOR)
Dan lenor pei
Kot mo ti grandi
Ti’ena enn kolinn
Kot enn ti lasours
San gran anbision
Ti avoy dilo
San rod ti faver
Dan enn larivier
Ki mari vantar
Ki zet so kouran
Dan enn osean.
Dan ti rwiso la
Ti ena lavi
Enn lot kalite
Me tou bann dimoun
Ti prefer pran kont
Extraordiner
Dan gran larivier
Ek dan gran dilo
Lot kote dilo
Apart enn tidev
Ek so tidevi,
De lisien maron
Dan enn gran kazot
Lisien espesial,
Sikse komersial.
(There was once a spring which fed a clear stream, which generously fed a ravenous river betrothed to an all-devouring sea. All living creatures ignored the spring and its clear water, having a preference for the ravenous river and the all-devouring sea, except for two mongrels, tidev and tidevi.)
Tidev-tidevi
Ti tann lamizik
Dilo kler rwiso;
Admir larkansiel
Lalimier soley;
Lapes kamaron;
Fer lelvaz lapia.
De kote rwiso
Zot ti ranz miray
Kot ti neseser
E parsi-parla
Zot ti fouy kanal
Pou aroz later,
Karo sonz-kreson.
(They loved the music of the spring and the running water and admired the rainbow beauty of the sun; they fished and bred, picked and grew, built walls, parapets and bridges, dug small canals to irrigate fields, gardens and orchards.)
Kote larivier
Ek kote lamer
Letaz ti pe fer
Piti lor letaz;
Larivier-lamer
Ti vinn depotwar;
Resofman lor baz
Ar kriz klimatik;
Pol nor koumans fonn;
Lamer la monte,
Aval filao;
Bann bato manze
Pe tas lor brizan.
Lafaminn pappa!
(On Seaside and Riverside, there was business growth, dumping, warming and climate-crisis, melting of polar ice, dramatic rise in sea level and food shortage.)
Me kote lasours
Ek kote rwiso
Pie zak, friyapen,
Karo may, batat,
Maniok ek arouy;
Pwason dilo-dous
Ek poul vakabon
Ti pe donn zot tou
Enn bouse manze.
(At Springside and Streamside, there was plenty of jackfruit, breadfruit, corn and tapioca, freshwater fish and roaming chicken for one and all.)
Moral mo zistwar?
Pa mwa ki ti ranz
Lasours ek rwiso;
Ti zis pran konsians
Vital ekzistans
E ti kontinie
Fer travay Bondie:
Fer ordiner vinn
Extraordiner;
Seki neseser
Exprim so bote.
(My story? I did not build the spring or the stream. I simply acknowledged their existence and helped the creation of ‘a thing of beauty and a joy forever’.)
Kikfwa lasours la
Ek so rwiso kler
Se nou lang kreol,
So literatir,
So nouvo kiltir;
Soubasman solid
Enn nouvo nasion!
(Maybe the spring and stream are my mother tongue, the new literature and culture, strong building blocks of a new nation in the making.)

BUSINESS LOBBIES VERSUS LOVE AND COMPASSION
OPEN LETTER TO DR K. JAGUTPAL
Dear friend,
PPS is killing me slowly and maliciously. I badly need easy access to CBD oil, which is now legal but not yet openly commercialised and easily accessible. It is state-controlled and hence gives extra power to a handful of unscrupulous medical and non-medical civil servants.
I understand that powerful business lobbies in the medical field, be it medical private practice or importation and sale of chemical painkillers (paracetamol-based) are dead against for it will affect business and profit. The argument that drug users will use it to prepare synthetic drugs is nothing less than ridiculous.
CBD oil, which is not psychoactive like THC, will help about a quarter of the population of the Republic, over 250,000 people who must daily face all kinds of pains and discomfort due to arthritis, sciatica, anxiety and depression, epileptic seizures, cancer pains, Parkinson, Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS), high blood pressure, insomnia, menstruation, menopause, diabetes complications, migraine etc.
CBD oil is legal and easily accessible in many countries including South Africa, India and most European countries and states in the USA.
We cannot allow a few “rupee-bespectacled-bastards” (Linet roupi dan lizie) to deprive thousands of suffering honest citizens of a safe and efficacious medication.
Let us all walk the talk together and facilitate access to CBD oil.
Brotherly namaste,
Dev Virahsawmy (a PPS patient)

FREEDOM VERSUS RULES
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM VERSUS RULES OR THE NEED TO STANDARDISE
“The term standardization is generally used within linguistics to refer to the process of bringing about a standard language. This process brings to a language a uniformity and consistent norm and form of writing and speaking, and the promotion of uniformity and consistency usually entails the reduction or elimination of variation. On a social level, the standard language is usually identified as the variety with highest prestige. Outside the linguistic community, the standard language—particularly the written mode—is usually considered an integral part of national (or supraregional) identity, being seen as the most widely used variety of the language, the official variety of the language, the national language, or even just as the language of that nation. The standard language is also seen as the most correct variety, what is called the “standard-bearing” component of standardization, which is its example-function that also paves the way to language purism. Linguists, however, usually see the standard variety of a particular language as one among many dialects of that language, and often find it difficult to define what the standard is, partly because it is generally held that “standard language” is an ideology rather than a concrete reality…” (https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199772810/obo-9780199772810-0250.xml)
Or to put it simply we could say: “Language standardization is the process by which conventional forms of a language are established and maintained. Standardization may occur as a natural development of a language in a speech community or as an effort by members of a community to impose one dialect or variety as a standard. (https://www.google.com/search?q=language+standardisation&rlz=1C1CHBD_enMU962MU962&oq=&aqs=chrome.0.69i59i450l8.1023562j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
QUESTION 1
Should we promote a standard variety or simply let people speak the language the way they want?
Opinions differ but as a language planner and an educationist, rightly or wrongly, I am in favour of the building up of a standard national language to ensure universal functional literacy and numeracy in the Republic of Mauritius.
QUESTION 2
What does this entail?
First of all, we must have a good knowledge of the phonology and syntax of the language. Then, a study of the evolution of English, a very prestigious creole language, from a pidgin to a quasi-universal language is of great help. What has been the contribution of writers, especially Shakespeare? What is the relevance of the development of printing or the translation of the Bible? What has been the impact of the opening of schools all over the place and the teaching of the 3 RS – reading, writing and arithmetic – in the children’s mother tongue.
L1 creative writing; translation of major lay and religious classics; basic mother tongue literacy and numeracy at school are important ingredients of standardizasion.
QUESTION 3
Besides these objective considerations, are there not also some subjective considerations?
What appears more genuine and less la-di-da?
Mo pe vini/ Mo pe vien. 2. Zordi mo res lakaz/Jourdwi mo rest lamaison. 3. Chombo, pa sap lor kal. / Besoin pran ou mal anpasians. 4. Elekter. / Electeur.
QUESTION 4
How can the printing and electronic media help?

ORACY, LITERACY AND NUMERACY
These 3 skills are vital for the good running of a modern society and the full enjoyment of the benefits of modern living by its citizens. Unfortunately, in the Republic of Mauritius, these skills are not understood and are confused with basic schooling or the basic utilizations of a mobile phone.
ORACY
The motor speech area of the human brain is called Broca’s area. It is believed that human speech emerged some 100,000 years ago after a very long process of evolution and neurolinguists, who study the neural mechanisms in the human brain that controls the comprehension, production, and acquisition of language, think the learning process starts in the womb. This is why the child’s first language is called mother tongue. It must be noted that what we call speech organs, are in fact breathing and eating organs adapted to produce a variety of phonemes (vowels, consonants and tones) combined to produce socially and culturally meaningful strings of sounds.
The human genome is equipped to produce speech or oral skills.
LITERACY
If speech in humans is ‘natural’, the acquisition of literacy skills (reading and writing) is a different cup of tea. There is no brain area responsible for mastering literacy. A learner has to build a mental bridge between their Broca’s area and visual cortex and that is not an easy task specially when basic literacy is taught through a foreign language. This is why specialists believe that initial basic literacy should start in the learner’s mother tongue (L1) and should not be confused with functional or advanced L2 literacy (literacy in second or foreign languages). When the bridge between Broca’s area and the visual cortex has been built through L1 literacy, then the doors are open for L2 or L3 literacy.
What is happening in our Republic? In 1994 about 30,000 children took the then CPE and about 15,000 (50%) moved to secondary schooling and 7 years later only 5,000 obtained the HSC certificate. We can safely assume that 50% of our children remain non-literate after 6-7 years at primary school; that 8 out of 10 fail to reach functional literacy after 13-14 years at school. Are our kids stupid or are our schools to blame? Do we have the political will to change? Do our kids fail or have our schools failed?
NUMERACY
What is numeracy?
Numeracy means understanding how maths is used in the real world and being able to apply it to make the best possible decisions. It’s as much about thinking and reasoning as about ‘doing sums’. It means being able to:
• Interpret data, charts and diagrams
• Process information
• Solve problems
• Check answers
• Understand and explain solutions
• Make decisions based on logical thinking and reasoning (https://www.nationalnumeracy.org.uk/what-numeracy)
Numeracy is not to be conceived as the ability to use a mobile phone to chat, to buy some veg at the market or to play dominoes.
My Babam, grandmother on my father’s side, was functionally orate in 3 languages (Telugu, Bhojpuri and Creole, which she called Kirryol) but non-literate and non-numerate. Yet it was impossible to trick a single cent from her ‘sannchi’ – her waist-moneybag. My uncle Samy, non-literate and non-numerate, was a domino champ.
DON’T MIX ISSUES
We may have a smattering of 2 or 3 languages but generalised non-literacy and non-numeracy or low standards thereon will certainly hinder economic, political, social and cultural progress.
When will party symbols disappear from our ballot papers?

THE 2024 MAIN ISSUE
In 1967 the main issue was independence or not. The main issue in the forthcoming general elections will be the battle between Hindutva and Mauritianism or, in clearer terms, between those who want to make of our home island an appendage of ‘Maha Bharat’ (Great India) to be known as ‘Chota Bharat’ (Small India) and those who reject the ideology of those who claim that Mauritius is little France and that of those who are striving to make of Mauritius Little India. They are the Mauritianists.
The Maritime Republic of Mauritius or the Mauritius archipelago (Mauritius, Rodrigues, Agalega, the Chagos archipelago and other outer islands) has its own identity and culture which we refer to as Mauritianism and Mauritianist and which embodies, among other things, 1. a vast maritime space in which are found several Creole Islands (as defined by Megan Vaughan in her book “CREATING THE CREOLE ISLAND, Slavery in Eighteenth-Century Mauritius”); 2. a very vibrant common language made up of 3 mutually understood varieties, Mauritian, Rodriguan and Agalegan; 3. all these islands are peopled by people who have a common history for they are all immigrants from Africa, Europe and Asia, specially India and China; 4. there has been the emergence of a special cuisine which borrows from Africa, Europe and Asia to create something which can only be tasted and appreciated in the Maritime Republic of Mauritius.
For practical reasons we use the terms Mauritianism and Mauritianist to refer to the following:
• The people of the Maritime Republic of Mauritius;
• The language and culture of the people of the Maritime Republic of Mauritius;
• Cultural and biological metissage;
• Secularism. All religions are equal and conversion must be prohibited. People should be free to worship the Almighty the way they want or not to worship at all.
• Mauritian (Mauritian Creole) and Rodriguan (Rodriguan Creole) should be used as medium of instruction, accompanied by English in grade 1 to 6. In grade 7 to 13, English should become the medium, accompanied by Mauritian and Rodriguan. This course in BILINGUAL LITERACY is possible for English is also a creole language.
• We live in the Mauritius Creole Archipelago and the population is made of Indo-Creoles, Afro-Creoles, Islamo-Creoles, Euro-Creoles, Sino-Creoles etc.
Proponents of Hindutva are very active and powerful while Mauritianists are unable to organise themselves into a coherent force. Do I have to tell you who will wear the crown in 2024 and for a long time to come?
I pray Jesus, an avatar of Vishnu, to bless us. Will I continue to preach in the desert? My answer is “yes”, as long as I still have some breath left.

WALK THE TALK
NO TO DOUBLE STANDARDS!
LET’S WALK THE TALK!
I would like to congratulate the government in general and my friend, Dr K. Jagutpal, in particular, for the wise and appropriate decision (a brave move in the Mauritian context) to legalise and make accessible medical cannabis which eventually will help thousands of our Mauritian sisters and brothers suffering from a wide range of pathologies from cancer to migraine. A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION! Eventually, medical cannabis will be liberalised and made accessible to all those who need this efficient painkiller. Now we must move one step further: the decriminalisation of THC, found in RECREATIONAL CANNABIS, as opposed to INDUSTRIAL CANNABIS, for there is now plenty of evidence that a combination of THC from recreational cannabis and CBD from industrial cannabis, also known as hemp, can help to relieve pains and give comfort to thousands of citizens of the Republic.
Let us stop pretending to be what we are not. Stop the game of ‘VIRGIN WHORES’!
According to the law of Mauritius, recreational cannabis which contains THC, is as dangerous a drug as heroin or cocaine. Most scientific and medical reports on dangerous drugs include the following: alcohol, nicotine (tobacco), Fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, Xanax, oxycodone, ketamine, morphine, valium but ‘marijuana/hashish’ known in Mauritius as ‘ganja’ does not feature in the list. Please note the following:
• In the underground economy, ‘ganja/mas’ business is flourishing.
• On special occasions such as the Hindu festivals of Holi, Divali, Maha Shivaratri, Ganga Snan, ganja is smoked and consumed in the form of bhang and consumers are free to do so.
• For the Rasta community, ganja is a sacred element and is an important ritual requirement of worship, but they are not free to use it. If caught, they end up in prison.
• Ganja consumers are peaceful people while alcohol consumers can become violent and do a lot of harm. Yet ganja is illegal, and alcohol is accessible to one and all.
Why do we tolerate this double standard?
To fight drug trafficking and drug abuse, it is imperative that we have a clear mind and not lump odd things together. One good step in the right direction is to decriminalise the growing and consuming of ganja. Efforts, time, money, and energy thus saved can be diverted to efficiently fight trafficking and abuse of hard drugs.
IT IS TIME TO WALK THE TALK!

FOOD SECURITY
DON’T BE STUPID!
Discussions on food security very often reveal a total misunderstanding of the real issue. For too long political and economic leaders have thought that the right approach is to produce what we are good at, i.e., sugar, and with our foreign exchange earnings import food – 75% of our consumption. Since the 1980’s, economic globalisation and its Siamese twin, neoliberalism, have become the be-all and end-all of economic thinking and consequently food security is conceived in terms of basic and elementary economic mantras such as ‘Supply and Demand’, ‘Economic Advantage’ and ‘Economies of Scale’.
Shelve you Economics textbooks and try to think otherwise. With GLOBAL BURNING (worse than global warming) and CLIMATE CRISIS (worse than climate change) humanity has to chart a new road to sustainable development in harmony with nature. It’s a simple question of ‘DO OR DIE’. We need nothing short of an agricultural and cultural revolution. What does this entail?
A NEW CULTURE
1. Eat what we can grow. We cannot grow staples such as rice and wheat but we can replace them by breadfruit, jackfruit, potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, manioc and arrow root. We can make flour with manioc, maize, breadfruit, sweet potatoes etc. You don’t need wheat flour to enjoy your bread, chapati, dalpuri or farata. You only need to be creative. No need to reinvent the wheel. Already, talented Mauritian chefs are offering delicious manioc faratas and galettes.
2. Difficult times have revealed the inventive and creative power of our brothers and sisters in vegetable, fruit and herb production. We can move to a much bigger scale.
3. We must encourage free range animal husbandry in the production of good goat meat, chicken and egg and not promote ruminants which release a lot of methane.
4. We must replant our mangrove forests to improve supply of sea food (fish and crustaceans).
5. Dependence on sugar must be reduced and industrial cannabis promoted. Let the sugar barons drown in their molasses and let us assist small and medium planters to innovate and consolidate reform and food security.
6. An agrarian reform is much needed.
7. Healthy eating must become a national concern. Because of unhealthy eating, 45% of our population are overweight or downright obese and 25 % have diabetes and associated pathologies.
8. WE MUST MOVE AWAY FROM GLOBALISATION TO REGIONALISATION AND LOCALISATION.
WHO WILL BELL THE CAT?
The government in power and the main opposition political parties are ideologically tied to neoliberalism and globalisation and it is futile to expect serious positive actions from them. Lalit and to some extent Rezistans are aware of the urgent needs to change but the admirable people prefer business as usual. Donc, ce n’est pas demain la veille!

KAN TRANSPOR ANPANN
Kan lezel kase ek elis anpann
Marsandiz gayar vit-vit vinn bien rann;
Avion-kargo pa kapav desir ler;
Bato-kargo pa kapav fouy lamer.
Diri ek dible boude dan grenie;
Tisert par balo res dan latelie;
Vit-vit letazer dan bann magazen
Get kliyan kouma bann zako sagren.
Bann pie friyapen ti gayar lontan;
Pie maniok ek may ti mari frengan;
Gardmanze lokal ti nouri zanfan
Avan ki roupi desid otreman.
Aster oblize fer kouma avan.
Letansa zanfan finn tas dan koutvan.

OLAMMA!
Mo babam, mo papa so mama,
Sak fwa li gagn enn sok, agase,
Gagn sirpriz, pa’le kwar so lizie,
Larg so emosion ar “Olamma!”.
Tradision kas pikan? Olamma!
Enn menaz dan dife? Olamma!
Zanfan pe gat nasion? Olamma!
Siklonn pe menase? Olamma!
Si li ti la zordi, deroulman
Ti pou plen so lespri ar traka;
Ti pou fer li perdi so zizman.
Pie ki pa respekte bann sezon?
Zanfan ki pa respe zot paran?
Ki pou fer? “Olamma! Olamma!”

Olamma: Expresion Telegou ki vedir “Ayo mama!” ousa “Ayo Bondie!” (Sanass Virah Sawmy)

ENN PARSI LOT PARLA
VIZIB VERSIS ENVIZIB
Kot nou, seki vizib ki enportan!
Boukou form kolorye, sa ki frengan;
Plis li enpozan, pran boukou lespas,
Samem garanti pou gagn boukou kas
Parski gran dimoun lao satisfe
Ki so bann serviter anba kone
Seki fer so leker mari kontan.
Bengker sek, li montre so kontantman!
Kot nou, ena detrwa latet brile
Ki refiz pran kont tamtam toukouler.
Swadizan zot medite ansilans!
Anverite zot kasiet zot soumrra:
Pa donn kas souskripsion pou konstriksion;
Parrsadi lor tanbalon partaze.
2-3 GAZAL/ SOME GHAZALS
01: POU TWA, POU MWA, POU NOU
Ze-me-mwa, I-me-mine, mo-mwa
Samem pwazon nou douniya.
Poumwa-poutwa egal pounou
Limem lakle trezor karrma.
Kan dan done ena gagne
Nou lekzistans dir “Mwa ki la!”
Kan biennet lotla enportan
Nou aret fer nou sinema.
Kan kreasion donn devlopman
Pa enn me tou, vre tamasa!
Zezi ti vinn dir nou tousa
Me nou prefer enn lot lavwa.
(when I-me-mine is king
something important is missing
the key to happiness is sharing
but we prefer not to remember
what Jesus told us)
02: POU DIR MERSI
Saraswati finn tranp mo plim
Dan enn polank kouler siblim;
Vishnou finn ranz fraz Morisien
Ar douser lekleraz lalinn;
Trimourti, Tridevi, Zezi
Finn aroz lavi ar sennbim;
Mo finn konn lamour, lamitie,
Boner, sekirite, lestim …
Mem si vieyes ek maladi
Bes mo bobes, li pou enn krim
Bliye mo devwar lezitim
Desinn sourir mem enpe dim.
(I have been given so much
that I am duty-bound
to give back as much
if not more
thank you my good Lord)
03: GET ENVIZIB
Mo seve Malbar, to seve pikpik;
To seve lalwes, mo seve Lafrik.
Mo vwazen pe dir pa kapav kontan
Parski gat nasion pe fer malefik.
Tou seki fizik pronons diferans;
Resanblans kasiet dan metafizik.
Les zot palabre, zot kontan zaze!
Ti pikir moustik pa pou touy mistik.
Mo lamour pou twa, to lamour pou mwa
Samem gran kado nou Senier Mazik.
Vishnou vinn Zezi, Zezi vinn Vishnou
Pou fer liniver vinn plis manifik.
(because we are different
they say it cannot be love
what is visible conceals
what, in fact, is most alike
Vishnu-Jesus taught us this
but we do not remember)
04. ZOT ENA MEM SEX ME …
Zot ena mem sex me zot’le marye;
Komeraz zaze, dir zot pe fane.
Maryaz oblize donn nesans zanfan;
Pa koz adopte! Zame ti konte!
Dan zarden-Dedenn finn fer nou konpran
Sa pa lamour sa! Sa se pitasie!
Me zot pe prefer lir Kama Soutra
Ki montre sime pratik malelve.
Kan nou Pap Franswa koz zanfan Bondie
Zot fer koumadir zot pa pe tande.
Zot prefer lamour fini simitier
Ki lamour fleri dan enn lot manier.
(just because they are non-binary
gossip thrives
sex must give new life
otherwise it’s a waste
read Genesis, not Kama Sutra
forget Pope Francis
and love which grows differently)
ALEGORRI-ALEGORRA
Bann Divinite, Shakti, Avtarr ek Profet
Ti desid pou kre enn pei model san fot.
Zot ti satisfe: zanimo ek plant ansam
Ar lalinn-zetwal ti pe viv dan mem lagam;
Pwason dan lamer, torti lor later, sevret
Larivier zame ti rod fann pikan raket.
Me kan tou korek bizen fer tansion:
Tantasion ek anbision pou rod tir kalson.
Koze la ki long! Ala gropoumon tir plan;
Lekersal koumans kasfes seki dan koutvan;
Lesprikabose, gransef larme bachara,
Koumans so fraka; kreasion dan lanbara:
Filao manz mangliye; dimoun manz gonaz;
Dodo manz feyaz; kriz klimatik fer laraz.
METAFOR/METAPHOR
Dan lenor pei
Kot mo ti grandi
Ti’ena enn kolinn
Kot enn ti lasours
San gran anbision
Ti avoy dilo
San rod ti faver
Dan enn larivier
Ki mari vantar
Ki zet so kouran
Dan enn osean.
Dan ti rwiso la
Ti ena lavi
Enn lot kalite
Me tou bann dimoun
Ti prefer pran kont
Extraordiner
Dan gran larivier
Ek dan gran dilo
Lot kote dilo
Apart enn tidev
Ek so tidevi,
De lisien maron
Dan enn gran kazot
Lisien espesial,
Sikse komersial.
(There was once a spring which fed a clear stream, which generously fed a ravenous river betrothed to an all-devouring sea. All living creatures ignored the spring and its clear water, having a preference for the ravenous river and the all-devouring sea, except for two mongrels, tidev and tidevi.)
Tidev-tidevi
Ti tann lamizik
Dilo kler rwiso;
Admir larkansiel
Lalimier soley;
Lapes kamaron;
Fer lelvaz lapia.
De kote rwiso
Zot ti ranz miray
Kot ti neseser
E parsi-parla
Zot ti fouy kanal
Pou aroz later,
Karo sonz-kreson.
(They loved the music of the spring and the running water and admired the rainbow beauty of the sun; they fished and bred, picked and grew, built walls, parapets and bridges, dug small canals to irrigate fields, gardens and orchards.)
Kote larivier
Ek kote lamer
Letaz ti pe fer
Piti lor letaz;
Larivier-lamer
Ti vinn depotwar;
Resofman lor baz
Ar kriz klimatik;
Pol nor koumans fonn;
Lamer la monte,
Aval filao;
Bann bato manze
Pe tas lor brizan.
Lafaminn pappa!
(On Seaside and Riverside, there was business growth, dumping, warming and climate-crisis, melting of polar ice, dramatic rise in sea level and food shortage.)
Me kote lasours
Ek kote rwiso
Pie zak, friyapen,
Karo may, batat,
Maniok ek arouy;
Pwason dilo-dous
Ek poul vakabon
Ti pe donn zot tou
Enn bouse manze.
(At Springside and Streamside, there was plenty of jackfruit, breadfruit, corn and tapioca, freshwater fish and roaming chicken for one and all.)
Moral mo zistwar?
Pa mwa ki ti ranz
Lasours ek rwiso;
Ti zis pran konsians
Vital ekzistans
E ti kontinie
Fer travay Bondie:
Fer ordiner vinn
Extraordiner;
Seki neseser
Exprim so bote.
(My story? I did not build the spring or the stream. I simply acknowledged their existence and helped the creation of ‘a thing of beauty and a joy forever’.)
Kikfwa lasours la
Ek so rwiso kler
Se nou lang kreol,
So literatir,
So nouvo kiltir;
Soubasman solid
Enn nouvo nasion!
(Maybe the spring and stream are my mother tongue, the new literature and culture, strong building blocks of a new nation in the making.)
ADIE ANI, NOU ZOLI TOUTOU
Yer to ti la, zordi non!
San atann to finn kit nou.
Nou fami-lakaz-lakour
Zordi dan boukou tristes

ALA KI MO KWAR/CE QUE JE CROIS
Bondie dan kiltir domine par ideolozi Zideo-Kretien, li maskilen-sengilie (Papa dan lesiel). Dan kiltir Islamik, Allah pa ena jennder (li jennder nyoutral) me Koran an Angle servi ‘he’ e ‘il’ an Franse. An Morisien problem la pa poze parski pronom ‘li’ li maskilen, feminen e jennder nyoutral. Ideolozi Greko-Romen finn amenn so blok parski sef bann bondie li osi maskilen-sengilie: Zeous/Zipiter.
Endouism so lapros bien diferan. Mahatma Lespri Iniversel (MLI) li konpoze ar 3 lafors: Kreasion (Brama), Prezervasion (Vishnou) ek Destriksion (Shiva). Dapre Endouism, lavi li enn kontradiksion; nanye pa ekziste san so kontrer; kouma nou ne nou koumans mor. Lebien ekziste parski lemal ekziste e visversa. Apel sa linite 2 kontrer: boner ek maler; lape ek lager; kreasion ek destriksion. Destriksion neseser pou amenn nouvo kreasion. Ant 2 kontrer ena enn lespas lekilib ki pa permanan me ki neseser: kreasion, prezervasion/lekilib ek destriksion.
Trinite Brama, Vishnou ek Shiva reprezant enn liniver dinamik ek inovan. Lafendimond pa ekziste parski li donn nesans so prop kontrer: NOUVO LEMOND. Siyans finn prouve ki depi BIGBENG finn ena boukou destriksion (black hole/trou nwar) e nesans nouvo liniver.
Sak divinite ki form parti MLI, li enpwisan san so Shakti – Brama/Saraswati; Vishnou/Lakshmi; Shiva/Parvati. Dan leker Endouism ena egalite jennder me bien tigit dimoun kone ou anvi kone. Bann zom prefer gard ek konsolid pouvwar despotik patriyarkal, enn karakteristik dominan dan ideolozi Zideo-Kretien.
                                        KI NOU ROL?
Dan vizion Zideo-Kretien, enn gran fose separ zanimo ek imen. Imen ti kree dan Zarden Edenn separeman ar tou lezot kreatir me dan vizion Endou enposib separ imen ek zanimo. Ganesha ena enn latet lelefan; Hanoumann ena enn lekor zako, Shiva ek so toro Nanndi zot enseparab. Anplis nou nam ki enn partikil Mahatma Lespri Iniversel (MLI) kapav abit lekor dimoun ousa zanimo depandan lor nou konportman avan nou lekor al dan tengn e ziska moksha (liberasion). Reenkarnasion mentenir relasion ant imen ek zanimo. Teori Darwin (evolision) ek Nou tou sorti Lafrik (Out of Africa) finn vinn konfirm entwision bann saz Endou: bann zanimo zot nou bann kouzen lwenten.
                                         NOUVO KILTIR
Endouism kapav ed bann ekolozis devlop enn nouvo kiltir anvironnmantal kot plant, zanimo ek dimoun viv an-armoni; fer nou aret get lanatir kouma marsandiz ki aste-vande. Sel fason pou sov nou planet. 10.04.22 
                                      CE QUE JE CROIS
Dans les cultures dominées par l’idéologie Judéo-Chretienne, Dieu est toujours au masculin-singilier (Dieu le Père). Dans la culture islamique, Allah est neutre du point de vue du genre mais dans les versions anglaises et franҁaises le pronom masculin-singulier (he, il) est utilisé. En Mauricien, le problème ne se pose pas car ‘li’, 3em personne singulier, est masculin, feminin et neutre dependant du contexte. L’influence gréco-romain doit être notée car le chef des divinitées mâles et femelles est masculin-singulier (Zeus/Jupiter).
Dans l’hindouisme la situasion est differente. Le Grand Âme-Esprit Universel est composé de 3 pouvoirs: Création (Brahma), Préservasion (Vishnou) et Destruction (Shiva). L’hindouisme conҁoit la vie comme une contradiction; rien n’existe sans son contraire; dès le moment de la naissance, nou commenҁons à mourir. Le bien existe parceque le mal existe et vice-versa. C’est l’unité des 2 contraires: le bonheur et le malheur; la paix et la guerre; la création et la destruction. La destruction est indispensable pour générer la creation nouvelle. Entre les 2 contraires, il y a un moment d’équilibre qui n’est pas permanent mais nécessaire: création, préservation/equilibre, destruction. La Trinité (Trimurthi) Brahma, Vishnou et Shiva represente un univers dynamique sans cesse renouvélé. La fin du monde n’existe pas car elle est la source d’une vie nouvelle. La science l’a demontré. Depuis le Big Bang, il y a eu beaucoup de destruction (trou noir) et la naissance de nouveaux univers.
Sak divinité qui fait partie du Grand Âme-Esprit est inpuissante sans son Shakti – Brahma/Saraswati; Vishnou/Lakshmi; Shiva/Parvati. Au coeur même de l’hindouisme, l’égalité du genre existe mais très peu sont ceux qui le savent ou veulent en savoir. En general, les hommes préferent privilégier le pouvoir despotique du patriarcat, caractéristique dominant de l’ideologie judéo-chretien.
                                  QUE FAIRE?
Dans la vision judéo-chrétienne, un grand fossé sépare humains et animaux. L’humain fut crée dans le jardin d’Eden loin du monde animal mais dans la vision hindouiste, il est impossible de separer l’humain de l’animal. Ganesha a une tete d’elephant; Hanouman a le corps d’un singe; Shiva et so taureau Nandi sont inséparables. Ajoutons à cela le fait que l’âme humain qui est une particule du Grand Âme-Esprit, peut habiter un corps animal dépendant du comportment avant la mort et ce jusqu’au Moksha (la grande liberation). La reincarnasion maintient une relation entre l’humain et l’animal. La science moderne (evolution et Out of Africa) semble confirmer l’intuition des sages hindous: les animaux sont nos cousins lointains.
                            LA NOUVELLE CULTURE
L’hindouisme peut aider les écologistes à developper une nouvelle culture de l’environnement permettant aux plantes, animaux et humains à vivre en harmonie; nous aider à ne plus considerer la nature comme valeur marchande et à sauver la planète, s’il n’est pas déjà trop tard.

COVID-19: BLESSING IN DISGUISE?
Date: 12.05.21
This opinion piece will certainly irritate most Mauritians who tend to find solace in focussing on only one side of any matter. To dare say that COVID-19 could be a blessing in disguise is ‘blasphemous’ and ‘sacrilegious’ as it deliberately ignores its negative impact on business.
1. Since the 1980’s, political, economic, social and cultural pundits have placed their faith in the basic tenets of neoliberalism (ultraliberalism): globalisation on the one hand and “less government” on the other. Globalisation, i.e., the free circulation of money and goods, has revealed its other face: the free circulation of viruses.
2. The neoliberal belief which says that the state should not interfere with economic matters, has simply dissolved into thin air. Instead of less government, we now need more government to fight diseases and subsidise economic activities.
3. Mixed economy (private and public involvement) has returned with a vengeance at planetary level. Regulation and more state control are now the order of the day.
BUSINESS AS USUAL OR CREATE NEW NORMAL?
With the rise of industrialisation and capitalism there has been a tendency to consider nature as a mass of inert objects at our disposal to be used, consumed and thrown away. The result has been a total destruction of nature leading to global burning and climate crisis. We have to learn to rebuild nature and live in harmony with it. What does this mean?
1. ECONOMIC REFORMS: An economy driven by cupidity and selfishness can never be sustainable. It will simply favour a minority but drive the majority below the poverty line. Profit by itself is not a problem if it is one of the measures of efficiency which should include social and ecological responsibility, not the ONLY one. A good mix of private and public enterprises supported by a strong cooperative movement is what we should aim at. Humanity must start to prize solidarity and sharing which is strongly prescribed by some religious texts.
2. FOOD SECURITY: We must grow what we eat and eat what we grow. This can be done. New home-grown staples (potato, sweet potato, grapefruit, cassava, corn, arrowroot) should eventually replace the existing imported ones (rice and wheat). The production of red meat should be discouraged and fish farming and free-range poultry farming encouraged. Food security also means a new food culture which can help us fight such pathologies as obesity and diabetes.
3. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: This should become an integral part of our national culture and for this to happen we must undertake a massive reform of our education sector which, at present, manufactures thousands of non-literates every year. Universal literacy and generalised IT go together like your ox and cart. Universal bilingual functional literacy (UBFL) can be achieved by a judicious use of our two creole languages, namely Mauritian Creole and English (another creole language).
4. A GREEN OUTLOOK: All activities must take into account their impact on nature. Fossil fuels must be banned.
If we want to face COVID-19 and other future pandemics, humanity must develop new attitudes towards MOTHER NATURE. It is now a question of survival, not one of choice. We have already done too much damage to nature.

1. DAN GOUDLENNS

Finn efas reper ki ti pe ed mwa
Desinn zeografi mo destine.
Zot dir nou samem apel devlopman:

KAROUSEL ENFERNAL
Kovid pe dir nou viv enn lot manier;
Aret pran Bondie pou zero depo
Ek lanatir pou lamone kontan.
Nou tou bizen fer kouma bann lontan
Ki pa ti gaspiy later ek dilo,
De kado Bondie pou viv dan boner.
Me malsans pou nou, laplipar dimoun
Prefer vertiz dan so gran karousel
Ki tourn, tourn, tourn, tourn kouma enn toupi
Akout fwet lor nay dan zwisans zordi.
Dan kraz enn montagn ena gro profi,
Dan fouy bann tinel pou tir lenerzi
Ki lerla servi pou roul karousel
Ena bel maja pou detrwa dimoun.
Roulman enfernal karousel biznes
Fer nou voltize, anpes nou trouv kler
E lerla zwisans trouv leternite
Dan fraksion segonn enn kout desarze.
Kan nou tourn anron, nou trouv mem zafer
E sa anpes nou konpran nou enn fes.

AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER
A FEW THINGS TO REMEMBER
The culture and creole language festival must be put in its proper context.
• The English language uses the word ‘language’ to mean ‘the principal method of human communication, consisting of words used in a structured and conventional way and conveyed by speech, writing, or gesture’. The word is also used to mean other things as in such expressions as: vulgar language, language of flowers, language of mathematics etc. The French language has TWO words: ‘langue’ and ‘langage’ as in expressions such as ‘la langue franҁaise’ and ‘le langage des oiseaux’. The Mauritian language (Mauritian Creole) has TWO as well (lang and langaz). It’s my belief that we should not ignore this. We should refer to ‘lang kreol’ and NOT to ‘langaz kreol’.
• Creole is a group or family of languages which emerge when speakers of two or more languages feel the need to develop a new instrument of verbal communication. There are more than 100 such languages in the world; they are found in all continents and have a variety of lexifiers (the main vocabulary source). At the initial stage, the new speech which is very elementary, is called a ‘pidgin’. As it grows structurally and lexically and becomes the mother tongue of children, it enters a second stage of evolution known as ‘creole’. A third stage is reached when it takes the name of a community/people/country. Mauritian, is the first language of 90% of the Mauritian population and the second language of the remaining 10%. It is a misnomer to call it LANGAZ KREOL. The world has now several prestigious creole languages: Afrikaans, Sango, Krio etc. The most prestigious of them all is English, the world lingua franca, a quasi-universal language, which we are fortunate to have as our official language.
• Mauritian Creole is not a corrupt form of French (broken French). If French has been the main lexifier for quite some time, now the national language of the Republic is open to English vocabulary and also that of several north and south Indian languages over and above words of Islamic and Chinese origins. At the level of syntax, it is analytic (isolating) and not synthetic (inflexional) as French. We are very fortunate that from a syntactic point of view, our national and official languages are quite similar and this is definitely an advantage to help us attain universal functional literacy.
• We live on creole islands where immigrants from Africa, Europe and Asia have chosen to build their future. Moreover, we speak three creole languages – Mauritian, Rodriguan and English. We have a beautiful creole cuisine which is developing very fast thanks to the creativity of our chefs and homemakers.
• Let us celebrate this unique culture!

A CHANGED WORLD
Before the British inglorious empire invaded, occupied and looted India, she was one of the richest countries in the world. When India won her freedom with sweat and blood, she was one of the poorest.
Yet she remained a moral beacon for the world in terms of secularism, non-violence, democracy, non-alignment and “Indian Ocean, Zone of Peace”.
But the India, which is getting richer, has lost her soul. Under the RSS and BJP, she has become the property of a handful of billionaires in US dollar terms; she is aligned to the USA and share power and control with the Yankees; she has close ties with far-right forces; she is rewriting history to justify racism; she glorifies murderers (Nathuram Godse, the murderer, has become a hero and Mahatma Gandhi, the father of Indian independence, is portrayed as a traitor).
PEI SAN NAM
Lontan-lontan ti ena enn pei
Lwenten-lwenten kot rises dan lespri
Ti boukou pli for ki rises kofor.
Dimoun ti toler san okenn zefor
Diferan kiltir, diferan pwennvi
Ki li dan legliz ousa libreri.
Enn zour enn mazisien ti sanz tousa.
Rises dan kofor li priyoriter;
Toulezot krwayans se bann envansion
Pou anpes pei vinn siperpwisan.
Depi sa zour la se lalwa paysa
Ki ti vinn lerwa parmi diniter;
Panse inik san okenn konsesion
Ti vinn enn manntra pou tou bann zanfan.
Nepli ti toler okenn diferans;
Pa pans parey ti garanti soufrans.
Depi sa zour la, asasen swami
Ti gagn grad oustad dan lakademi.

A LAND WITHOUT SOUL
A long time ago
There was a faraway land
Where the beauty of the mind
Was considered superior
To material-physical wealth.
Being different was not a sin.
A sorcerer changed all this.
Wealth replaced health:
Freedom of thought
Was simply banned;
The murderer of a saint
Is now an acclaimed hero.

(JALOG FILOZOFIK)
PREMIE EK DEZIEM PARTI

SANTE LAPE
O Lespri Siprem, protez nou toulede, profeser ek zelev. Axepte nou devosion. Donn nou kouraz. Fer nou letid ekler nou lespri. Amenn lape parmi nou.     OM! LAPE! LAPE! LAPE!

PREMIE PARTI
1
Vajasrava ki ti pe rod rekonpans ar Bondie, ti ofer tou so dibien dan pouja Viswajit. So garson ti apel Nachiketas.
2
Kan ti pe partaz parrsadi, lafwa ti rant dan leker Nachiketas ki malgre so zenn laz ti panse:
3
Sa bann vas la zot bann karkas pre pou mor. Seki ofer sa kouma sakrifis pe pran sime maler.
4
Li dir so papa: Papa-Papa, ar kisannla to pou donn mwa? Li repet so kestion detrwa fwa. So papa reponn: Mo pou zet twa dan lebra Lamor.
5
Nachiketas ti reflesi: Parmi zelev mo papa, momem premie me si konpar mwa ar lezot mo pa katar me zis mwayen. Ki Papa pou gagne ler li met mwa dan pale Yama (Lamor)?
6
Anou get ennkou seki ti viv avan ek seki pe viv zordi. Bann mortel zot kouma lagren ki mor ek rene apre.
7
Enn envite sakre, li kouma enn laflam ki rant dan nou lakaz. Pou tengn sa laflam la, bizen fer sakrifis e donn parrsadi. Be Vaivaswata, amenn dilo.
8
Si enn envite sakre res san manze dan lakaz enn bachara, sa pov jab la so lespwar, anbision, repitasion, bon axion, zanfan ek dibien pou tom dan dilo, pou fini net.
9
Yama ti dir: O Envite sakre! Onorab envite! Mo salie twa. Parski to finn res trwa zour san manze dan mo lakaz, dimann mwa trwa kiksoz, O Onorab Envite respekte.
10
Nachiketas ti dir so panse: Fer ki mo papa, Gotama, aret pran traka pou mwa. Fer so koler kont mwa fonn e met lape dan so leker. Fer li ouver so lebra pou akeyir mwa ler to retourn mwa kot mwa. O Lamor, sa se mo premie reket.
11
Yama reponn: Mo pou fer to papa kontan twa kouma avan. Li pou dormi anpe e li pa pou sap lor kal ler li retrouv twa.
12
Nachiketas azoute: Dan rwayom Bondie lafreyer pa ekziste parski to pa laba; vieyes pa fer per. Kan lafen, laswaf ek sagren finn chal, res zis lazwa.
13
To konn bien, O Lamor, sakrifis dife ki ouver laport paradi. Dir mwa, ki ena foul lafwa ek lesperans, vremem bann ki dan rwayom Bondie pa pou konn lamor zame? Si wi, samem mo deziem dezir.
14
Yama ti reponn: Mo bien konn sa dife ki ouver laport paradi. Ekout mwa bien. Samem sime pou gagn tou seki volapenn gagne. Samem lasours Gran Biennet.
15
Yama lerla dir li ki sakrifis-dife, samem koumansman tou; ki bizen e kouma enstal zot pou ranz otel sakre. Nachiketas repet parker tou seki ti pe dir li. Lerla Lamor ti satisfe e ti dir:
16
Ala enn lot kado: Dife-sakrifis aster pou apel ‘Nachiketas’. Mo pou osi met enn harr larkansiel otour to likou.
17
Seki fer sakrifis-dife Nachiketa trwa fwa, dan linite ar Trwa – mama, papa, profeser -, e ki fer so trwa devwar fondamantal – etidie Veda, fer sakrifis e donn sarite – li pou transand nesans ek lamor. Seki konn ador dife lalimier, ki finn sorti dan vant bon dimoun e ki konsian ekzistans Li, sa dimoun la pou konn lape eternel.
18
Seki metriz trwa kalite dife Nachiketa e ki fer sakrifis-dife Nachiketa ar trwa kalite konesans, ki finn kas lasenn lamor e ki ploy sagren, sa dimoun la pou rant dan rwayom Bondie.
19
Nachiketas, se to dife ki ouver laport paradi e sa se to deziem don. Sa dife la pou sarye to nom pou toultan. Ki to trwaziem reket?
20
Nachiketas ti reponn: Ki ariv dimoun apre lamor? Ena kwar li kontinie ekziste, ena, non. Dir mwa seki mo bizen kone. Samem mo trwaziem reket.
21
Yama ti reponn: Mem bann pli gran rishi pa ti sir lor la. Pa fasil ditou. Dimann enn lot. Pa obliz mwa reponn.
22
Nachiketas ti reponn: O Lamor, to pe dir ki mem bann gran lespri ti ena dout e pa fasil konpran. Peyna to segon dan profeser. Mo pa kwar kapav ranplas sa reket la.
23
Yama ti dir li: Dimann mwa zanfan ek tizanfan ki pou viv 100 an; dimann toutsort kalite dibien; dimann enn extra long lavi.
24
Si to axepte ranplas sa reket la par enn lot, mo donn twa rises, pouvwar ek maja.
25
Enposib vinn posib. Fam, jalsa, nisa kalite lor kouler pou vinn to repa kotidien. Pa dimann nanye lor lamor.
26
Nachiketas reponn: Mo pa’le gonaz ki zoli-exitan me ki vinn lapousier vit. Mo pa’le tamasa, wachiwala ek jalsa-douniya.
27
Dibien enn perttan. Lamor balye tou. To’le nou met nou desten dan to lame? Akord mwa mo trwaziem reket.
28
Ki sa bourrbak ki finn koste ar imortalite e ki finn konpran ki bote ek zwisans zot tengn lor vites, pou al rod enn long lavi jalsa-tamasa?
29
O Lamor, dir mwa ki arive apre lamor. Sa ki mo anvi kone. Nanye pa enportan apart sa.
OUPANISHAD-KATHA
DEZIEM PARTI
1
Yama ti dir: Seki bon se enn zafer e seki nisa-diwana-mastana li enn lot zafer. Sa de la zot ena obzektif diferan me toulede kapav amar nou. Li korek si kikenn swazir seki bon. Seki swazir nisa-diwana-mastana, li finn fini rant dan ganndol.
2
Bon ek lotla koste ar nou; enn dimoun eklere li etidie ek analiz toulede avan deside; seki eklere prefer seki bon me gopia swazir nisa-diwana-mastana ki lekor done.
3
Nachiketas, to enn gran malen, enn dimoun bien rezonab-responsab ki tourn so ledo ar nisa-diwana-mastana. To finn refiz seki dimoun lager pou gagne.
4
Ignorans ek sazes zot de extrem opoze. Mo kwar Nachiketas pe rod sazes parski giling-giling, madigra ek fanfrelis pa detourn so latansion.
5
Bann gopia ki kas poz dan ignorans me ki kwar zot bann terib, bann mahakalipa. Rezilta: zot fer koustik dan karo pikan kouma aveg dirize par aveg.
6
Leternel zame Li montre figir divan lizie bachara ki manitize par fos lalimier roupi. Pou li zis paysa ki valab. Akoz sa li rant net dan mo pano.
7
Bien tigit tann Li e konpran Li. Li, koumadir, pe koz dan vid. Kan enn profeser extra, li bizen zelev extra ki dizer konesans ki pe donn li.
8
Kan joukal deklar profeser, zelev res dan nwarte e bann mo pa kapav fer nou dekouver nou Nam, nou prop profon. Pou nou konn nou profon Noumem, nou bizen enn bon profeser e pa ena lot sime.
9
Mo bon matlo, pa kapav dekouver nou Nam – nou profon noumem – ar enn pake koze, ar zimnastik entelektiel; zis enn bon profeser kapav fer nou trouv Lalimier. Nachiketas, to finn fini ariv lor top; to finn dekouver Laverite. Dan lavi bizen plis dimoun kouma twa.
10
Trezor materyel li efemer e li pa posib mont lor lesel glason pou al dan lesiel. Dife-Sakrifis Nachiketa finn fabrike ar seki perisab, li paret eternel me li ‘si li pou zwenn.
11
Mo zenn matlo, to finn aprann boukou kiksoz: satisfaxion dezir, soubasman liniver, benefis ki gagne ar ritiel, dekouvert nouvo lemonn, seki merit admirasion ets. Me parski to lespri eklere, to finn rezet seki siperfli ar fermte.
12
Enn dimoun eklere par profonder meditasion lor so prop Atma, so Nam pir, kone ki Lasours Tou, ki pa vizib e ki dan profonder innaksesib, Limem Bondie. Sa dimoun eklere la li libere parski li finn reysi kas lasenn kontantman ek sagren.
13
Enn imen ki finn bien konpran sa e ki kapav fer diferans ant so li vizib ek so Li profon, gout veritab lazwa parski li pe bengn dan Lasours Lazwa. Nachiketas, twa to finn reysi sa.
14
Nachiketas dimann Yama: Ki ete Sa ki ni li verti ni li vis; ni li koz ni li efe, ni li pase ni li fitir? Ki li ete sa?
15
Yama ti reponn: Pli gran valer dan Veda ki tou letid proklame, ki bann vre devo rode atraver abstinans ek partaz se, e pa ena lot, Om.
16
Sa mo la li sakre, li Siprem. Seki konn sa mo la gagn tou seki li anvi.
17
Samem pli gran soubasman. Seki realiz sa, li rant net dan Sakre.
18
Nou nam peyna koumansman, peyna lafen. Li pa sorti dan nanye e nanye pa sorti dan li. Li ti toultan la; Li toultan la e Li pou toultan la. Li pa konn lamor.
19
Li pa konn touye ni Li gagn touye.
20
Nou nam li pli rapid ki rapid, pli gran ki gran; Li dan profon tou kreatir. Zis seki libere, pa konn ni dezir ni sagren, ki ena lape dan lekor ek dan lespri, zis sa bannla ki kapav kontanple bote ek laglwar nou nam.
21
Mem asize, Gran Li vwayaz partou; mem dormi, Li al partou. Kisannla apart mwa ena pouvwar pou kone ki sa Bondie la, li dan lazwa e pa dan lazwa anmemtan?
22
Enn dimoun eklere ki kone ki dan profon so lekor mortel ena laflam imortel ki pli for ki tou malgre li envizib, sa dimoun la zame li pou mosad ek tris.
23
Letid bann liv sakre pa kapav dir nou ki Bondie ete. Ni nou lentelizans, ni lansengnman kapav fer nou trouv MAHA-ATMA; nou pou trouv Li selman si Li desid pou revel limem ar nou.
24
Seki pe bengn dan lemal, ki pa pe kapav kontrol so dezir, ki pa konn kalm ek serenite, zame li pa pou trouv Bondie mem si li lir mil liv.
25
Alor kisannla kapav kone kot Bondie ete? Lafors lespri, lafors lekor e mem lamor zot enn badinaz pou Li.

Kan nou’nn tas dan lenpas, pa fer fos
Tap latet lor miray, pou grenn ros.
Si fer sa nou latet ki gagn bos!
Li bet sa, persiste, tourn anron;
Nou perdi nou letan kouma gon.
Pil anplas li pa enn solision.
Fer kouma Swami Vivekanann!
Ranz sime dan dezer, lasavann;
Tras nouvo santie pou sort dan bwa;
Zwenn lezot ki pe viv mem traka.
Pa ena de Bondie. Zis Ennsel!
Li partou, Li konn Tou, konpran tou.
Nou osi apel Li Zezikri,
Lespri Sen ki pran form enn imen.

A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE
Date: 23.05.21
Upon Loga’s insistence, I sat with her to watch a concert on YouTube given by the Berklee Indian Ensemble and was completely carried away by the ripple, wave, underwater current and eddy of a wonderful musical experience not to be associated with escapism but with the certitude that life can be made meaningful.
“What started out as a class at Berklee College of Music in 2011 has become one of the hippest global acts to emerge from Boston: the Berklee Indian Ensemble. Founded by Indian Berklee alumna and faculty member Annette Philip ’09, the ensemble provides an open and inclusive creative space for musicians from all over the world to explore, study, interpret, and create music influenced by the rich and varied mosaic that is Indian music today.
With high-profile collaborations featuring iconic artists A. R. Rahman, Ustad Zakir Hussain, Shreya Ghoshal, Shankar Mahadevan, Vijay Prakash, and Clinton Cerejo, the Berklee Indian Ensemble is renowned for its global Indian sound that honors traditions while experimenting with cross-pollination of genres, cultures, and multidisciplinary art forms. From a Carnatic thillana or a high-adrenaline konnakol conversation to Indo-jazz experiments or qawwali, the ensemble performs an expansive repertoire in addition to the 20 original student compositions the group has premiered to date.” (BERKLEE COLLEGE OF MUSIC)
The prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, is mostly known for its work on and teaching of jazz. Our great jazz musician, the late Ernest Wiehe studied and taught there. But little is known in Mauritius of an original musical creative experiment embodied by the Berklee Indian Ensemble.
IMAGINE:
1. Talented composers, musicians, singers and dancers working as a team;
2. Talented artists, male and female, from all over the world, sharing the same enthusiasm generated by their love of music;
3. The whole gamut of musical genres from India expressing originality and blending into each other to produce new musical experience;
4. Musical instruments from all over the world embracing sorority and fraternity.
In a nutshell, this is what I experienced on YouTube.
What can all the immigrants on this (our) beautiful creole island learn from Berklee Indian Ensemble? We have talented artists from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds; musical genres from all over the world; musical instruments from across the globe. But it seems that we tend to focus more on what divides us rather than on what could unite us. The different musical genres and musical instruments are perceived as markers of ethnic and cultural distinctiveness rather than venues for cross-pollination/miscegenation/metissage.
Ernest Wiehe and a few other talented musicians have felt the need to chart a new original creative course and have tried to initiate changes without much success because very few are those who are prepared to leave their comfort zones.
But today, because of the presence of different racist initiatives, it is imperative that artists in the musical field start to bring down walls and build bridges. Only they can teach us to hear and feel the beautiful music of human understanding, kindness and love.
Since music IS the food of love, play on brothers and sisters of music; charm us with your magic.

SANTE LAPE
OM! Li (Envizib-Absoli) li antie; li’si (realite vizib) li antie; Envizib Antie donn lavi tou seki vizib. Mem si realite vizib sorti dan vant Antie Envizib, Antie res antie.
OM! LAPE! LAPE! LAPE!
          1
TOUSA, tou seki ekziste dan liniver, li dan lame Bondie. Kan nou finn rezet seki fos, lerla nou kapav profit seki vre. Fale zame ou zalou ou prosen.
          2
Si nou anvi viv 100 banane dan sa lemonn la, nou bizen viv dapre drwatir (Karma). Peyna lot sime. Sel fason anpes nou axion fann malang lor nou.
          3
Si nou finn martiriz nou nam, ler nou mor, nou pou rant dan marenwar ignorans.
          4
Gran Li, san bouze, li pli vif ki nou lespri. Seki nou lekor dir nou pa kapav depas Li parski Li, li toultan divan-divan. San bouze Li vwayaz pli vit ki seki galoupe. Grasa Li, latmosfer nouri tou lavi lor later.
          5
Li bouze san bouze. Pli Li lwen, pli Li pre. Anmemtan Li andan ek andeor tou.
          6
Seki trouv tou kiksoz dan Gran Lespri e Gran Lespri dan tou kiksoz pou toultan rekonet Li.
          7
Pou seki trouv tou dan Li, pa pou ena ni erer, ni sagren parski Li dan tou e Li partou.
          8
Li anglob tou, Limem Lalimier san form, san tas, san lekor, san pese; Li trouv tou, Li konn tou; Li depas tou e Li ekziste par Limem; Li finn ranz tou pou toultan.
          9
Seki priye ignorans ek foste (Avidya), li fini dan marenwar; seki priye zis konesans (Vidya), li li pou glis dan pli gran marenwar.
          10
Konesans ena so prop target; ignorans ena seki pou li. Samem ki nou bann rishi finn montre nou.
          11
Kan nou metriz ek kontrol konesans ek ignorans anmemtan, lamor ouver laport imortalite.
          12
Seki ador zis nenport-envizib pou grenn dan marenwar epe e seki ador zis nenport-vizib pou koul dan pli gran marenwar.
13
Kan nou ador nenport-envizib nou tous enn bit; kan nou ador nenport-vizib nou tous enn lot. Samem lansegnman ki bann rishi ti donn nou.
          14
Seki konn alafwa Vre Envizib (Lasours Lekzistans) e realite materyel-efemer, li pou travers lavi-lamor lor rado konesans e vinn imortel parski li pou konsian ekzistans Lasours Tou ki envizib.
          15
Vizaz Laverite li kasiet deryer enn disk annor. Bondie mo Bondie, montre mwa to figir pou permet mwa ki ador Laverite, get To figir.
          16
O Sourrya, bondie Soley ki travers lesiel, ki kontrol tou, ramas reyon To dife pou permet mo lizie dekouver To bote ek To grander. Aster mo konpran ki Li ek mwa fer ennsel.
          17
Fer ki mo nam zwenn MahaAtma-Kosmik Eternel ler mo lekor pe pouri. O mo nam, rapel tou seki to finn fer! Rapel tou! Pa bliye nanye!
          18
O Laflam-Veloute, montre nou vre sime ki amenn nou dan lavi-beni. O Bondie, Twa ki konn nou profon, protez nou kont lemal ek foste. Axepte nou penitans ek lapriyer toultan, toultan, toultan.

SUR LE MORISIEN
Date: 20.05.22
                                ORIGINE ET DÉVELOPPEMENT DU MORISIEN
Les racistes pensent que le créole mauricien est dû au fait que les esclaves africains, à cause de leur nez plat et levres épaisses, avaient du mal à parler franҁais.
Les coloniaux et néocoloniaux disent qu’il n’est qu’une excroissance du bourbonnais ou bien un patois, en d’autres mots, une forme corrompue ou batarde du franҁais.
Pour moi, le créole est un parler qui se developpe quand le besoin d’un outil de communication se fait sentir en milieu multilingue. Au départ ce pidgin se repose sur des universaux dont est programmé notre ADN. Il devient créole quand il devient la langue première de la nouvelle generation.
Si le morisien s’est developpè à Maurice, il a prit naissance ailleurs, plus precisement dans le bassin méditerranéen ou pendant plusieurs siècles, les gens de la mer utilisaient un pidgin. Comme sur tous les bateaux il y avait des marins de plusieurs nationalités, un lingua franca était indispensable. Il était aussi utilisé par les voyageurs – colons et esclaves.
À Maurice, colonisateurs et administrateurs d’une part et travailleurs-esclaves etaient obligés de l’utiliser, d’ou son developpement rapide. Même si la langue lexificatrice principale était le franҁais, la phonologie differait et la syntaxe encore plus. La naissance d’enfants de parents d’origine diverse fit que le pidgin devint L1. Le pidgin élémentaire devint plus sophistiqué à tous les niveaux – phonologique, syntaxique et lexical. C’est maintenant une langue créole. Avec la conquête de Maurice par les Anglais et l’arrivée des travailleurs venus d’Inde, le developpement lexical s’est fortement acceleré et diversifié.
Le Morisien aujourd’hui est la langue nationale de-facto de la republique et il possède tous les valeurs, ingredients et forces necessaires pour devenir la langue nationale de-jure.

ANSAM-SEPARE-ANSAM
Nou ti zwe ansam, lontan:
Gouli-dannta, boul-sifon,
Lamok delivre, kanet,
Sapsiway ek kouk-kasiet.
Sakenn so sakenn aster
Lor portab zwe mem zafer;
Klik SMS silansie
Dan ortograf deregle.
Dan natak ek sinema
Nou ti pe partaz riye
Ek plore san tralala.
Aster tousel nou goute
Lor lekran tou kalite
Kari poul san masala.
Pir! Ansam viv separe:
Ansam pou lizie dimoun
Me sakenn dan so kote.
Separe-ansam fer kloun,
Fer vadire pa normal
Anverite pli normal
Ki normal. Viv hawann koun!

LITERESI BILENG BAZIK
LITERESI BILENG BAZIK
(Prepare par D.V pou ed profeser ansengn LITERESI BILENG BAZIK (Morisien ek Angle)
1. SON/SOUND
MORISIEN
Kan nou pe koze, nou servi bann son pou form silab e nou kol bann silab ansam pou fer bann mo.
Ekzanp: b+a = ba (kiss); ba+ba = baba (baby); b+a+g = bag (ring); b+a+j = baj (badge); b+a+t = bat (bat); ba+t+o = bato (boat); ba+ta+na = batana (bangle/bracelet);
ENGLISH
To speak, we use sounds to form syllables and then combine syllables to form words.
Examples: b+a+r = bar; b+e+d = bed; b+i+n = bin; bo+d+y = body; do+mi+no = domino; fa+mi+ly = family; ho+ri+zon = horizon; mo+to+car = motocar; sim+pli+fy = simplify;
DETRWA TI PROBLEM (learning special english sounds)
/ch/ kouma dan chake, cholo, chombo, choula, chana, cheke, chok, choukchouk, choupchap,
/ch/ as in chair, cheers, choose, chose, chosen, church, chimney, cha-cha-cha, chocolate,
/j/ kouma dan jak, jam, jaz, jos, job, jok, jinn,
/j/ as in jam, jazz, job, juice, Jack, jeans, joke,
/h/ kouma dan haldi, hep! horl, hiphiphiphoura! houlahoup,
/h/ as in has, had, half, he, his, her, horse, house, hip,
/sh/ kouma dan shal (shawl), shek (cheque), shik (chic)
/sh/ as in shoe, show, shop, should, shade, shape, ship,
/r/ kouma dan rate, rode, rido, robine, retar, rouz, (/r/ Morisien li sorti dan fon lagorz, koumadir pe grat lagorz pou tir flem, me /r/ Angle ena enn son diferan. Morisien anzeneral gagn difikilte pou prodwir /r/ Angle.)
/r/ as in rat, red, rose, rise, (Generally, the sound is made by bringing the tongue up and to the back of the mouth. While the bulk of the tongue rests on the roof of the mouth between the hard palate and the soft palate, the tip of the tongue hovers just below the hard palate. The lips are rounded in an O shape. The sound is voiced, which means that the sound that /r/ produces comes from the vibration of the speaker’s vocal cords.)
/th/ kouma dan mo Angle ‘this, that, those’ li enn son enportan pou lang Angle me mazorite Morisien pronons li kouma /z/. Donk ‘this, that, those’ vinn ‘zis, zat, zoz’.
Profeser Angle bizen aprann prodwir sa son la.
/th/ With the exception of being voiced (this) or unvoiced (thing), the /ð/ and /θ/ are nearly identical; the tip of the tongue is placed behind the top front teeth. The friction occurs between the tip of the tongue and the top front teeth. An alternative method of producing the ‘th sounds’ is to place the tip of the tongue between the top and bottom front teeth.
ZERO PROBLEM
Lezot son pa poz problem. Bizen diviz bann son an 2 kategori: vwayel ek konsonn:
VWAYEL
/a, e, i, o, ou/ kouma dan pa, pe, pi, po, pou. Sa zot bann vwayel oral – pas par labous.
Ena osi dan Morisien 3 vwayel nazal (ki pas par nene): an, en, on kouma dan ‘ban, ben, bon.’
KONSONN
b, ch, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, sh, t, v, w, x, y, z kouma dan ba, chacha, de, fifi, gaga, halwa, jam, kot, lot, mo, ne, pe, reso, so, shek, to, vo, wat, tax, yoyo, zalou. Note ki Morisien pa servi /q/.
PLAIN SAILING
No real problem with other sounds which are divided into vowels and consonants.
VOWELS
/a, e, i, o, u/ as in pat, pet, pit, pot, put.
There are no nasal vowels in English.
CONSONANTS
b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z as in bag, cat, dog, fat, got, hot, jot, kit, lot, mat, not, pot, queen, rat, sat, tap, van, won, ox, yes, zip.
LANG SILABIK EK LANG AR AKSAN TONIK
Morisien li enn lang silabik, savedir ki tou bann silab dan enn mo zot pran mem kantite letan pou prononse: bote, borlamer, ledikasion.
Angle servi aksan tonik, savedir ena enn silab ki dimann plis letan pou prononse: beauty, seaside, education.
Enn bon diksioner Angle neseser pou profeser aprann ek montre aksan tonik.
STRESS-TIMED & SYLLABLE-TIMED LANGUAGES
Mauritian is syllable-timed. A syllable-timed language is a language whose syllables take approximately equal amounts of time to pronounce. English is a stress-timed language. That means some syllables will be longer, and some will be shorter.
A good dictionary can help teachers to master and teach stress. Remember that words with two or more syllables have at least one stressed syllable.
2. GRAMER/GRAMMAR
FRAZ
Dan enn fraz ena enn nom ek enn verb.
Ekzanp: Dev travay.
Dev se enn nom.
Travay se enn verb.
SENTENCE
In a sentence there is a noun and a verb.
Example: Dev works.
Dev is a noun.
Works is a verb.
PRONOM
Pronom se enn mo ki ranplas enn nom kan ou lekter ou interlokiter kone deza ki nom la reprezante. Par exanp, ou kapav dir, “Mo ena enn kouzen. Li enn artis.”
Mo/I, to/you, li/he or she, nou/we, zot/you or they (depending on context), bannla/they
PRONOM SIZE:
Mo travay. To travay. Li travay. Nou travay. Zot travay. Bannla travay.

PRONOM OBZE: mwa, twa, li, nou, zot, bannla

(Note: ‘Zot’ fer referans plizier dimoun ki prezan e ‘bannla’ fer referans bann ki pa la.)
PRONOM REFLEXIF: Se bann mo ki fini ar ‘mem’ kouma momem, tomem, limem, noumem, zotmem, bannlamem.
Ekz: Li finn bles limem. (He/She has hurt himself/herself.)
Nou fer noumem ditor. (We do ourselves harm.)
Bannlamem fer maler bannlamem/Bannlamem fer zot maler. (They themselves cause their own misfortune.)
PRONOM REFLEXIF POU MET ANFAZ
Kapav servi pronom reflexif+ pou apiy lor enn zafer.
Ekz: Noumem nou responsab nou maler. (We, ourselves are to blame.)
PRONOUN
Pronouns are the words you substitute for other nouns when your reader or listener already knows which nouns you’re referring to.
Ex. “I have a cousin. He’s an artist.”
English pronouns: I, you, he/she, we, you, they.
Mauritian pronouns: mo, to, li, nou, zot,bannla
PRONOUN AS SUBJECT
Mo travay./ I work. To travay./You work. Li travay./He or she works. Nou travay./We work. Zot travay./You work. Bannla travay./They work. (Note that the 3rd person singular of the verb takes an <s>)
PRONOUNS AS OBJECT: mwa/me, twa/you, li/him or her, nou/us, zot/you, bannla/them.
Ex: He or she fools me. He or she fools you. He or she fools him or her. He or she fools us. He or she fools you/them.
REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS are words ending in -self or -selves. The nine English reflexive pronouns are myself, yourself, himself, herself, oneself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, and themselves.
Ex: I have hurt myself, (Mo finn bles momem.)
You have hurt yourself. (To finn bles tomem.)
She has hurt herself. (Li finn bles limem.)
They have hurt themselves. (Bannla finn bles zotmem.) Note that, depending on context, ‘bannla’ and ‘zot’ may be interchangeable.
REFLEXIVE PRONOUN FOR EMPHASIS:
We ourselves are to blame. (Nou ki responsab nou maler.)
I have only myself to blame. (mo bizen aksepte ki momem ki antor.)
NOM
Ena 2 kategori nom: Nom prop ek nom komen.
Nom prop se nom dimoun: Dev, Devi, Paul, Pauline, Rashid, Rashida ets.
Nom komen se nom bann kiksoz, bann obze kouma: lakaz, liv, kaye, plim, sak ets.
SENGILIE/PLIRYEL
1. Dan Morisien, enn nom li kapav sengilie (ena enn sel) ousa li kapav pliryel (ena boukou). Pou endik plieryel Morisien met mo ‘bann’ divan nom la.
Ekz.: bann zanimo; bann lisien; bann pie; bann zanana; bann pret ets.
Form nom dan Morisien pa sanze me ena plizier marker pliryel.
Ekz.: detrwa loto; enpe niaz, boukou kado …
(NB The form in Mauritian nouns does not change but plural markers are used.)
NOUN
There are two categories of nouns: proper and common. Proper nouns refer to people: Dev, Devi, Paul, Pauline, Rashid, Rashida etc.
Common nouns refer to things, objects like: house, book, notebook, pen, bag etc.
SINGULAR/PLURAL
In English, a noun can be either singular or plural.
‘S’ is added to the word to show that there are many.
Examples: animal/animals; dog/dogs; tree/trees; pineapple/pineapples; priest/priests etc.
PLURAL FORMS IN ENGLISH
1. In English the nouns change in form. If the singular noun ends in –s, –ss, –sh, –ch, –x, or –z, add -es to the end to make it plural: bus – buses; marsh – marshes; lunch – lunches; tax – taxes, class – classes …
2. If the noun ends with –f or –fe, the f or –fe are often changed to –ve before adding the –s to form the plural version: wife – wives; wolf – wolves … Exceptions: roof – roofs, belief – beliefs, chef – chefs, chief – chiefs.
3. If a singular noun ends in –y and the letter before the –y is a consonant, change the ending to – ies to make the noun plural: city – cities, puppy – puppies…
4. If the singular noun ends in –y and the letter before the –y is a vowel, simply add an –s to make it plural: ray – rays; boy – boys …
5. If the singular noun ends in –o, add –es to make it plural: potato – potatoes; tomato – tomatoes …
6. Plural noun exceptions: photo – photos; piano – pianos …
7. Some nouns don’t change at all when they’re pluralized: sheep – sheep, deer – deer…
8. Irregular nouns follow no specific rules, so it’s best to memorize these or look up the proper pluralization in the dictionary: child – children, goose – geese, man – men, woman – women, tooth – teeth, foot – feet, mouse – mice, person – people …
VERB
Enn verb li enn mo ki reprezant action fizik kouma ‘galoupe, marse, piose, ekrir’ ousa aktivite mantal kouma ‘panse, santi, reflesi, considere’.

Pase: Mo, to, li, nou, zot, bannla ti finn travay.
Pase dan fitir: Si li pa ti malad, li ti pou finn travay.
VERBS
Verbs are words that represent actions that are external (run, jump, work) and internal (love, think, consider).
NB: A Mauritian verb has only ONE form. An English verb may have up to 5 forms.
Dev works.
Dev is working.
Dev has worked.
Dev worked.
Dev was working.
Dev had worked.
Dev will work.
Dev would work.
‘work’ has 4 forms (work,works,working, worked). English uses auxiliary verbs to indicate tense and aspect. The support verbs are ‘to be’ and ‘to have’.
TENSE AND ASPECT

ARTICLE
Let’s look at nouns. As in Mauritian, there is a definite and an indefinite article in English. Examples: a dog barks / the dog barks; a baby cries / the baby cries; ‘a’ is the indefinite article; ‘the’ is the definite article. In English ‘a’ is used when the noun begins with a consonant and ‘an’ is used before a noun which begins with a vowel. Examples: a bag, a dog, a girl; an ass, an eye, an island, an object …
MAIN DETERMINERS
Demonstrative Determiners
this/that; these/those: this tree/that tree/these trees/those trees
Possessive Determiners
my, your, his, her, its, our, their
Ex. my house; your house; his/her house; its house; our house; their house …
Quantifiers
all, every, most, many, much, some, few, little, any, no …
Ex. all flowers have died; each flower has its own beauty; most flowers have survived; many flowers have died; some flowers have survived; few flowers have survived; little rain fell; any flower will do; no flower has survived
Numbers
Cardinal: 1, 2, 3, 4 …/ one, two, three …
Ordinal: first, second, third …/ 1st, 2nd, 3rd …
Ex.:1 pen, 2 pens, 3 pens ….
first player, second player, third player …
Interrogative Determiners
what, who, whose, which, where
Ex. What are you saying?
Who said that?
Whose book is this?
Which one do you prefer?
Where are you going?
English ‘a’ is used when the noun begins with a consonant and ‘an’ is used before a noun which begins with a vowel. Examples: a bag, a dog, a girl; an ass, an eye, an island, an object …
AZEKTIF
Enn azektif kalifie enn nom, donn nou lenformasion lor nom la.
Ekz: enn bon toutou; enn zoli fler;
Ena ajektif ki plase avan nom ek azektif ki plase apre nom.
Ekz: enn gran lakaz; enn lakaz prop

Fler la zoli.
Bann zanfan la ere.
Lesiel ble.
Later ron.
ADJECTIVE
An adjective qualifies a noun; it gives us information on it.
Ex: a good dog; a beautiful flower;
Adjectives are always placed before nouns in English.
Ex: a big house; a clean house
Note that in Mauritian there is no copula. As a result, there is no auxiliary to connect a noun with an adjective and the adjective predicates without an auxiliary verb.
The flower (is) beautiful.
The children (are) happy.
Sky (is) blue.
Earth (is) round.
ADVERB
Enn adverb kapav donn plis lenformasion lor enn verb, lor enn azektif, lor enn lot adverb e lor enn fraz net.

Li endik entansite (adverb entansite): extra, mari, ase, enpe, tro, net, ets.
Li endik frekans (adverb frekans): souvan, rarman, zame, parfwa ets.

adverb kan: boner gramaten
adverb manier: kouma enn toke
adverb landrwa: dan enn vie lakaz
adverb entansite:kouma voras
adverb frekans: sak Vandredi
ADVERB
An adverb is a word that modifies (describes) a verb, an adjective, another adverb, or even a whole sentence. Adverbs often end in –ly, but some (such as fast) look exactly the same as their adjective counterparts.
Ex: He/She runs quickly.
The tree is very strong.
He drives too fast.
Angrily, they walked away.
FUNCTIONS OF ADVERBS:
They indicate time: today, tomorrow, yesterday etc.
Manner: softly, hard, quickly, slowly etc.
Place: here, there, outside, up, down, inside etc.
Intensity: very, super, quite, some, too much, completely etc.
Frequency: often, rarely, never, sometimes etc.
Note that adverbs also predicate without an auxiliary verb.
My mother is not here.
The dog is inside.
ADVERBIALS:
An adverbial is a group of words which function as adverbs of:
time: early in the morning
manner: like a half-wit
place: in an old house
intensity: like a glutton
frequency: every Friday

Bann Divinite, Shakti, Avtarr ek Profet
Ti desid pou kre enn pei model san fot.
Zot ti satisfe: zanimo ek plant ansam
Ar lalinn-zetwal ti pe viv dan mem lagam;
Pwason dan lamer, torti lor later, sevret
Larivier zame ti rod fann pikan raket.
Me kan tou korek bizen fer tansion:
Tantasion ek anbision pou rod tir kalson.
Koze la ki long! Ala gropoumon tir plan;
Lekersal koumans kasfes seki dan koutvan;
Lesprikabose, gransef larme bachara,
Koumans so fraka; kreasion dan lanbara:
Filao manz mangliye; dimoun manz gonaz;
Dodo manz feyaz; kriz klimatik fer laraz.

LAKLE KONFINNMAN
Enn nouvo mo, ‘konfinnman’,
Finn rant dan anvironnman.
Tou dimoun pe servi li
Bien souvan bonavini.
Konfinnman nouvo dimal?
Fizik wi me pa mantal.
Innyorans ek prezize
Toultan gard nou konfine.
Nou pa konn kominike,
Exprim nou avek klarte.
Nou finn perdi so lakle.
Lakle la ena trwa let:
L, A, R trwa alfabet
Pou fer mazik dan latet.

LAVI ENN KONTRADIKSION
Bhagavad-Gita so mesaz bien kler:
Nanye pa ekzis san so prop kontrer.
Savedir nanye pa konpletman bon;
Mem seki move ena so doz bon.
Panndit innyoran souvan rod fer kwar
Enn zour Lalimier pou touy Marenwar.
Vizion Manike ferm li dan brouyar.
Swa li nwar, swa blan; swa li blan, swa nwar.
Gita montre nou nam kontradiksion:
Ler lavi paret, lamor ‘si paret;
Si fas disparet, pil ‘si disparet;
Lamor innaksion se lamor aksion.
Si ou enn Endou ou pa kapav kwar
Dan Manikeism ki pou tengn ou far.

KAN TI DETAY ENPORTAN
Nou get esansiel, li bien kontan dir;
Detay bar gete, anpes nou trouv kler.
Si rod lipou poul, zafer la vinn pir;
Olie lalimier, nou trouv tou traver.
Esansiel ouver laport paradi
Tandik ki detay pouri nou lavi;
Esansiel donn nou progre, devlopman;
Letansa detay pe fann so pikan.
Me pa bliye ki Gita pe dir nou:
Nanye pa ekziste san so kontrer.
Esansiel enn zour pou vinn lapousier;
Lerla detay ki pou ena bon gou.
Li boukou pli bon ki nou gard balans
Ant de kontrer pou anpes avalans.

WHY NOT SIMPLY DECRIMINALISE?
WHY NOT SIMPLY DECRIMINALISE?
I may not have special knowledge on this issue but the little knowledge I have seems to suggest that cannabis is less dangerous and harmful than rum and tobacco and yet the latter items are legal while cannabis is not. We may ask why.
The simple reason is that those involved in the production and marketing of products related to rum and tobacco are economically and politically powerful and the state derives a lot of revenue from the sale and consumption of these products. If cannabis were decriminalised, successful and profitable businesses which generate social disasters, will be affected and that would mean less state control and benefits.
What are the consequences?
• Recreational cannabis consumers are jailed and are often put in cells together with hardened criminals who rape them and little by little, take control of their lives. When they leave prison, they join the drug underworld.
• Drug trafficking and related businesses thrive.
• There is a rise in the commercialisation and consumption of synthetic drug with disastrous consequences.
CRIPPLED BY IGNORANCE AND FEAR
Some people tend to put cannabis in the same category as all hard drugs. Others argue that it opens the door to hard drugs. In fact, cannabis is considered ‘soft’, same as alcohol and tobacco. Although there are a few cases of young consumers moving from soft to hard, in general this is not the case. This myth is meant to prevent clear thinking. Why is not alcohol or tobacco banned as a measure to close the gateway to the hard stuff?
Aren’t we all mini-Macbeths who are “cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in to saucy doubts and fears”?
Our political, social and cultural so-called leaders do not have the guts (I feel frustrated not to be able to use a different part of the anatomy) to challenge prejudices and hypocritical notions. With such people at the helm, we will never build an enlightened nation.
INDUSTRIAL AND MEDICAL CANNABIS
There are different species of the cannabis plant: those with a higher THC (psychoactive ingredient) content and those with a high CBD (medical oil) content known as industrial cannabis/hemp.
“Hemp, or industrial hemp, is a botanical class of Cannabis sativa cultivars grown specifically for industrial or medicinal use. It can be used to make a wide range of products.[1] Along with bamboo, hemp is among the fastest growing plants[2] on Earth. It was also one of the first plants to be spun into usable fiber 50,000 years ago.[3] It can be refined into a variety of commercial items, including paper, rope, textiles, clothing, biodegradable plastics, paint, insulation, biofuel, food, and animal feed.” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp)
This plant can give a spectacular boost to our economy.
What are we waiting for?

RESIGN! OTHERWISE, WE’LL …
Excuse my naivete! I believe that if any person has reliable information concerning some unlawful activity, they (he or she) should report it to the responsible authorities and/or make it public. Honorable members of our legislative assembly have said that they possess damning information on the prime minister which they will make public if he does not resign immediately.
Excuse my naivete! Does it mean that if the prime minister resigns, they will keep the information concealed? Is this not BLACKMAIL being given a moral coating? Is this not a colourable device? Have I not the right, as a citizen, albeit naïve, of the republic, to know what horrors the prime minister is guilty of?
Excuse my naivete! Freedom of information and transparent governance are daily pronounced as basic rights. Have I not the right to know to be able to use my voting right judiciously?
EXCUSE MY NAIVETE! Mujhe maaf kar do! Pardonn mwa!

HOW DID IT ALL START?
DEV VIRAHSAWMY
5, Edwin Ythier Street, Rose Hill, 71368, Mauritius

HOW DID IT ALL START?
Translating JOSEPH AND HIS AMAZING TECHNICOLOUR DREAMCOAT into Mauritian Creole (MC) which most Mauritians thought was not a language, was a major challenging task. The roaring stage success of this rock-opera in a despised language gave us all the greatest culture shock our country has known. The door was now open to the promotion and standardisation of what has become the mother tongue (L1) of 90% of the population and the second language (L2) of the remaining 10% and moreover, this language is also the de-facto national (not yet de-jure) language the republic.
A short while later, my very good friend, Father Gerard Sullivan, came to me with another request: the bishop of Port Louis would like me to translate the Catholic liturgy from French into MC. Try to imagine my bewilderment! The challenge was so mind and soul stimulating that I could not resist. A confirmed atheist Marxist was to translate an important piece of religious text. When the finished text was handed over, Bishop Jean Margeot told me something which eventually will change my life: “Dev, celui qui a écrit ‘Lasours’ ne peut pas être athée. Je t’aime, mon ami!”
A few years later, I had the responsibility to organise independence celebrations and I decided to break away from routine. Instead of the bland formal flag raising ceremony, I planned a one-week celebration on the Gymkhana ground in Vacoas with a variety of artistic, cultural, social, and commercial activities which would culminate in the officiel and formal flag raising ceremony. I decided to call the event ‘ZANFAN LARKANSIEL’. Everything was ready for the opening ceremony. On the eve of that day, I returned home exhausted and went straight to bed, fell asleep. In my sleep, I heard a voice: ‘To kwar to enn gran mari! To finn bliye enn zafer enportan.’ What was that? Sleep had vanished. Where did I go wrong? O Lord! I did not check weather conditions in Vacoas during the first 2 weeks of March. I had to talk to the met office in the morning. I could not sleep. I left our bed, fell on my knees to pray, and begged for forgiveness. Loga, my wife, was shocked. The man she had known for over 22 years was on his knees praying. She tried to comfort me.
Early in the morning, I spoke to the chief met officer who told me that he had tried to contact me, in vain. March was the wettest month in Vacoas. Koup mwa peyna disan! The die was cast, we had to cross the Rubicon.
A whole week, the sky was overcast with thick black clouds but not a drop fell from the sky. On March 12, at midday, while the national flag was being raised, a glorious rainbow appeared over the Gymkhana ground. As soon as the ceremony was over, there was a huge downpour.
The next day Patrick Michel wrote in l’Express: MÊME L’ARC-EN-CIEL Y ÉTAIT.
The rainbow, covenant between God and man, became the diya on my road to enlightenment and wisdom. I started to study and translate religious literature, a never-ending process.
I have reached the following belief: God is Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) and Tridevi (Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati). Vishnu comes to us in times of woe to help us along and his latest ‘AVTAR’ (avatar) is Jesus.
My prayers are composed in my mother tongue and always begin with:
“Tomem nou Mama, tomem nou Papa (Tumhi ho Mata, Pita Tumhi ho).”

AN EYE-OPENER!
The book by the world-famous theologian, Daniel Marguerat, entitled “VIE ET DESTIN DE JÉSUS DE NAZARETH” (SEUIL) may shock those who, happy in their comfort zone, are unwilling to question, explore and learn. The book tells us that Jesus was born out of wedlock and fathered by an unknown person (né de père inconnu) and so had no rights at all in the society of his time.
As a Hindu who believes that Jesus is the latest avatar (incarnation) of Lord Vishnu after Gautama Buddha, who taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and severe asceticism, I am thrilled to take cognisance of the fact that God Vishnu, The Preserver, chose to come as a child devoid of all rights in order to preach “MERCY, PITY, PEACE AND LOVE”.
If you think that sex is the root-cause of all our misfortune; if you believe that true divinities are sexless; if it is your view that Trimurti and Tridevi do not make love, then you had better ignore this opinion piece and the book mentioned above.

LALIGN DRWAT PA EKZISTE
Limazinasion popiler
Rod so boner dan lalign drwat;
Seki pa drwat enn gran maler;
Seki kabose kraz jawat.
Lavi desinn enn lalign drwat
Depi nesans ziska lamor.
Se lamour fos ki kas kontour
E akoz sa ki li faypat.
Dan liniver tou pe tourne:
Lalinn li tourn otour Mata;
Later li tourn otour Sourrya;
Galaksi osi pe tourne.
Lavi-lamor monte-desann;
Dilo fonn, dife vinn lasann.

EKOUT MWA, PA EKOUT ZOT!
Mo fer lapriyer detrwa fwa par zour;
Fer pelerinaz detrwa fwa par an.
Mo fer sarite divan kalimay,
Katedral, kovil, manndiram, moske.
Pa perdi letan ekout bann balour,
Bann Lilipousien ki deklar zean.
To Darwin, Hawking ek lezot labay
Pe fann pikan pou kasiet zot pese.
Kifer to bizen ekout mwa, pa li?
Parski Li li ekzos mo lapriyer,
Beni mo ofrand ek mo parrsadi.
Si to pa ole ki Bondie modi,
Aret priye mesaze Lisifer
E tom lor lipie veritab sover.

DONKISOT MANTI
Ler mo dir bannla, pa bizen
Aksantegi, grav, sirkonflex;
‘e’ pa bizen beki ditou:
‘be’, ‘de’, ‘fe’, ‘ge’, ‘me’, ‘ne’, ‘pe’, ‘re’…
Zot fer latet dir. Tro kone!
Don Kisot dir moulen-avan,
“Aret tourn dan vid, mo piti;
Tansion tourdisman fer ravaz.”
Moulen-avan pa ekoute.
Zot tou kontinie persiste:
Si Franse servi bann aksan,
Kreol, batar Franse, bizen
Swiv model ki Bondie done.
Kreol pa gagn drwa fer zanfout.
Don Kisot dir moulen-avan,
“Aret tourn dan vid, mo piti;
Tansion tourdisman fer ravaz.”
Moulen-avan pa ekoute.
Pa bizen ‘e u r’; ‘e r’
Ase pou ekrir ‘travayer’,
‘ber’, ‘deryer’, ‘fezer’, ‘joubaner’.
Kan fonem ‘e’ pas par nene,
Ekrir li ‘en’, pa ‘in’.
Don Kisot dir moulen-avan,
“Aret tourn dan vid, mo piti;
Tansion tourdisman fer ravaz.”
Moulen-avan pa ekoute.
‘en’ + ‘n’ vinn ‘enn’; li pa vinn
‘inn’. ‘Latrenn’ zame vinn ‘latrinn’.
‘Ben’, ‘benn’; ‘den’, ‘denn’; ‘gen’, ‘genn’; ‘len’, ‘Lenn’
Zot gagn ginn kan Linn deklar Lenn;
Kan lalinn kwar li’nn vinn lalenn.
Don Kisot dir moulen-avan,
“Aret tourn dan vid, mo piti;
Tansion tourdisman fer ravaz.”
Moulen-avan pa ekoute.
Ler mo dir bannla, bizen plant
Bwa-debenn ek bwa-mangliye;
Bizen plant ‘hemp’ partou pou fer
Sebede, enn meksinn mirak,
Zot prefer plant kann ek dite.
Don Kisot dir moulen-avan,
“Aret tourn dan vid, mo piti;
Tansion tourdisman fer ravaz.”
Moulen-avan pa ekoute.
Ler mo dir bannla, friyapen
Nouri nou lekor ek lespri,
Zot dir zot prefer lafarinn
Sort Lafrans, basmati sort Lenn.
Batat-mayok fer zot gagn ‘wek’.
Don Kisot dir moulen-avan,
“Aret tourn dan vid, mo piti;
Tansion tourdisman fer ravaz.”
Moulen-avan pa ekoute.
Ler mo dir, lor nou lil Kreol,
Nou kapav ranz nouvo lavi
Zot pa dakor ditou-ditou:
“Nou Bondie, lizie ble, sorti
Lafrans”; “nou Shivji res dan Lenn.”
Don Kisot dir moulen-avan,
“Aret tourn dan vid, mo piti;
Tansion tourdisman fer ravaz.”
Moulen-avan pa ekoute.
Mo finn deside pou aret koze;
Olie rent mo nam ouver lizie tang,
Mwa ek mo Loga, nou finn deside
Kikfwa li meyer les bann tang anpe
Ler nou sant…
To ranpli mo lavi
Kouma ler dan mo poumon
Kouma soley dan lesiel
Kouma lapli an Mars
Kouma rafal enn siklonn
Kouma ble lamer kalm
To ranpli mo lavi
Vinn ranpli mo nam
Les mo kontan twa
Les mo donn twa mo lamour
Les mo ploz dan to lazwa
Mor dan to lebra
La toultan koste ar twa
Nou res ansam pou touzour
Les mo kontan twa
Ankor kontan twa
Hmmm …
Les mo donn twa mo lamour
Les mo kontan twa
Ankor kontan twa
To ranpli mo lavi …
(Sante Nimero 7, Marriage Encounter – Mersi Gerard Sullivan)

PREFAS
Enn swar mo ti reve ki bann zanfan Moris pe aprann lir ek ekrir dan zot lang maternel, Morisien. Lor vites mo ti rod 10 ti zistwar e mo ti tradir zot pou nou bann zanfan. Ler mo somey ti kase, mo ti asize, plore PARSKI NOU BANN ZANFAN PA KONN LIR ZOT LANG MATERNEL.
Ala NIMERO I sa 10 tizistwar la.
Nou zanfan pa pou kapav lir li me si ou konn lir, lir li ar nou bann ti marmay. Mo sir zot pou ennjoy!
1. TILATET PLEN SOMEY
Enn fwa dan enn pei ti ena, boner gramaten ler soley ti pe mont lor bann kolinn, e bann niaz ti roz-roz, enn zanfan dan profon somey dan so zoli ti lili dra blan.
“Tik-tak, tik-tak,” revey lor tabdenwi ti sey kas so somey san okenn sikse. Tilom ti vinn sourd net.
“Mo sir mo pou kapav kas so somey”, tizwazo ti dir. “Toulezour li donn mwa timil pou manze e mo sir mo sante pou fer li leve”. Lor enn brans so pie, li ti koumans sante. “Leve ti lamour, leve”. Li ti sante, sante, sante san rezilta. Lezot zwazo ti rant dan jalsa. Zot tou ti bat lamok. Tilom, ti ploye, may so lorye, dormi.
Li ti kontinie kaysou ler divan lete ti koumans soufle rafal. “Mo konn sa tilom la. Yer mo ti fer so awakal (moulenavan) tourne. Mo pas par lafnet, rant dan so lasam. Mo sir li pou leve.” Divan lete ti rant dan so lasam, ti kares so lazou ek ti sifonn so seve. Divan lete ‘si ti bat lamok.
Kok vantar dan poulaye ti koze, “Mwa ki pou lev li. Nou, nou de torsenn kole. Marke, gete!” Li ti mont lor enn kes, bat so lezel e ti koumans sante: –
“Koukouroukou, koukouroukou, leve do matlo!
Koukouroukou, koukouroukou, to pou gagn gato!
Li ti reysi lev bann denn, poul, kanar, lezwa, pentad; zanimo dan lekiri; kabri dan patiraz me tilom ti kontinie bos tayt dan so zoli ti lili konfortab. Kok nepli ti kapav. Anroue, li ti zet zarm.
Letansa, soley ti koumans briye partou dan karo, dan laplenn, lor kolinn, dan poulaye kot kok ti larg lekor, dan zarden kot zwazo ti sante. Li ti rant par lafnet pou al ekler figir nou tilom ki ti ouver so lizie. Deswit li ti koumans kriye, “Agema, agemagema!” Lor vites so mama ti vinn okip li.
“Kisannla finn kas somey mo baba?”
Personn pa ti reponn.
Personn pa ti kone.
Mem tilom pa ti kone ki se soley ki ti kas so somey.

ENN FWA DAN ENN PEI
(Pou Franҁoise Lionnet)
Enn fwa dan enn pei ti ena
Enn vilaz fouka net kot bannla
Ti pe fer kontrer ki ordiner
Ti pe fer san konpran so kifer.
Ti ena de kote gran sime
Lapis pou pieton ek bisiklet;
Noenntri pou loto, ti sime
Rezerve pou de pat ek kat pat.
De kote bann sime ti ena
Varyete pie fri, fler ek manze:
Friyapen, flanbwayan, zavoka,
Mang lakord, mezon rouz, dofine.
Zot ti plant toutotour zot vilaz
Karo may, pomdamour, bann laliann;
Ti kiltiv ti danbwa, patiraz
Ki ti donn zot dibwa ek laviann.
Ti lakour enn lakaz kasiet enn
Tiverze-potaze volapenn;
Poul ek kok vakabon mars-marse,
Parfwa mem tikabri galoupe.
Sak Samdi dan bazar bann planter,
Artizan, zardinie ek elver
Ti ofer marsandiz kalite
Bann kliyan ki toultan satisfe.
Tou zanfan dan lekol vilaz la
Aprann lir-ekrir lang zot mama
Ki koze partou dan tou lakaz,
Tou legliz ek dan konsey vilaz.
Sakenn priye dan so prop fason
San fer okenn diskriminasion.
Dan sak fet, vilaz net fer sourir
Dan respe kiltir ek lanatir.
Ler mo somey kase, ayaya,
Mo plore pou rev la revini.
Kalibann, Kalibann fer rev la
Revini do matlo! Rev beni!
Kalibann, donn nou tou enn koudme
Pou fer nou ti planet revinn ble.
Sinon limanite pou fini
Kouma yer dinozor ti fini.

LET US RECAP!

5, Edwin Ythier Street, Rose Hill, 71368, Mauritius

LET US RECAP!
1. The genus Cannabis has several species, two of which are of interest to us. They are recreational Cannabis, known in Mauritius as GANJA, which yields THC, a psychoactive drug, and industrial Cannabis, AKA hemp, which yields a great number of useful materials for building, rope making, manufacturing of textile goods, shoemaking, producing green electricity and for the preparation of an efficacious painkiller, known as CBD oil etc.
Industrial Cannabis (IC) yields up to 3 yearly crops and between rows (‘rigol’ in Mauritian) of IC plants food can be grown, killing two birds with one stone.
2. CBD oil can give solace, comfort, and respite to more than 250,000 Mauritians suffering from a whole range of painful pathologies, ranging from cancer to migraine.
CBD oil is legal and easily accessible in many countries such as the Republic of South Africa, India, most European countries, and most states in the USA.
3. In Mauritius, it became legal in November 2022 and is still not available to people who need it as it is under the control of a handful of medical and non-medical civil servants who are very keen not to let go their power for reasons we can easily imagine. They have invented several pretexts giving the impression that they are bent on reinventing the wheel.
4. Political, legal, social, medical activists and the private media should join forces to force the government to make CBD oil easily accessible in both the public and private medical institutions. The PM and his sycophants and cronies who constantly claim to love the people of Mauritius, should start to walk the talk, and not merely pay lip service to the welfare of one and all, while earnestly ensuring that the interest of some lobbies are not in jeopardy.
5. We need a massive popular movement to get those in power to understand that we mean business and that we have the means to settle accounts with those who think they can take us for granted.
DIBOUTE, MO MAM,
PA PER!
NOU POU RANZ ZOT KARI!

60 AN ANSAM
(60 YEARS TOGETHER)
Mersi Vishnou-Zezi, Bondie Lamour
Ki pa zis donn lamour me fer lamour
Mersi ou finn fer nou de sime zwenn
Ena swasant an peryod gran lapenn
De zenes tinejer bien ordiner
Tilom ti enn andikape fizik
Ki ti pe sibir sikane piblik
Ki ti apel li tilame-moyon
Lame zouzout garson-demiporsion
Tinengres la ar problem sikiatrik
Ti pe fer fas boukou mokri tipik
So lalev epe so seve boukle
Ti fer dimoun apel li mazanbik
Ni bote klasik ni zelev sikse
Se so bonker ki ti fer so bote
E ziska zordi malgre swasant an
Loga finn res enn dimoun sanpoursan
Bon zenere akeyan ek frengan
Vishnu-Jesus God of love, thank you for showing us the path of love some 60 years ago. He, a polio-victim was the object of mockery and she with some African features was ridiculed. Her beauty was in her kindness. Nobody saw that. But I did.
Mersi Vishnou-Zezi ki’nn montre nou
Evit sime plen ar pikan partou
Pa les mesanste vinn kas nou konte
E anpes nou ranz nou lavi ade
Kre ansam enn fami malgre dife
Ki ti pe fane otour nou partou
Par seki ti kont lamour-liberte
Thank you, Vishnu-Jesus for helping us through rough weather in a world where love is not prized.
Ler mo gagn enn plas liniversite
Pou fer letid literer avanse
Ala palab rekoumans fann pikan
Bann zoli fam blan pou kas so lelan
Li pou rod enn fam mem nivo ki li
Enn senp siniore pa pou bon pou li
When I was admitted to Edinburgh University, gossipmongering flared up again. He will soon forget her.
Me nou de nou ti ena nou prop plan
But we had our own plan.
Sakenn so kote nou pou travay dir
Fer lekonomi pou ranz lavenir
Rezwenn apre enn an pou nou marye
Lwen ar palabrer dan lentimite
Lamitie vre ki pa bizen flafla
Ki trouv so boner dan boner lotla
We would both work hard, save as much as we could and meet in London after a year for a simple wedding in the company of people who loved us.
Pandan enn an nou finn manz nou margoz
Boukou sakrifis pa lavi anroz
Loga etidie metie sekreter
Mwa mo kontinie letid literer
Zoli rezilta pou nouvo marye
Dan Skerry’s ek dan liniversite
Enn zoli job dan Chamber of Commerce
Aster kapav pans pou plonz dan resers
Lor lang Morisien kan so ler vini
Exitasion gran pa kapav tini
Apre M.A direksion lengwistik
Apre lengwistik kikfwa politik
The first year was financially difficult but we had a good life together and at the end of it Loga obtained her Secretarial Diploma at Skerry’s College and was given a secretarial job at the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce. Lean days were over. I started to plan research work on Mauritian Creole.
Dan liniversite Moris vites
Loga ti montre konpetans san zes
Anmemtan li ti pe swiv kour distans
Metie zournalis lir liv feminis
Letansa mo ti travay profeser
Profeser Angle ek literatir
E ansam nou ti okip edision
Bann liv literatir anMorisien
Edision Boukie Banane ti ne
E ziska zordi li pe kas pake
Loga finn ed mo bann aktivite
Ki li lengwistik ki li politik
Ki li literer ou pedagozik
Back in Mauritius, Loga was employed by the new University of Mauritius and I started work as a secondary school teacher. Soon we set up a publishing house to publish works in Mauritian Creole. Edision Boukie Banane was born and is still active. Loga helped me with my political, linguistic, literary and pedagogical work.
Kan nou de tifi nepli ti zanfan
Nou toulede anmemtan ti konpran
Ki li ti nou responsabilite
Tras nouvo sime pou rann zot ere
Nou toulede nou ti demisione
Kot nou ti ena plen sekirite
Pou kre enn lekol spesialize
Dan lang Angle ek so literatir
Pou permet nou ed nou prozenitir
Fer zot letid tersier dan Langleter
E okip travay pratik literer
Jennder non-biner lir-ekrir-konte
Dan nou de lang Morisien ek Angle
Soon we realised that to ensure a bright future for our 2 daughters we had to change course. We resigned where we were working, started an afternoon/evening/weekend school specialising in the teaching of English Language and literature. It was hard work but very successful. Saskia and Anushka were thus able to study in prestigious English institutions while we were still able to fund our favourite militant activities.
Devwar familial ek devwar imen
Toulede neseser me bien bizen
Enn bon balans ant sa de devwar la
Lor vites Loga ti konpran tousa
Militan jennder lokal rezional
Enternasional finn gard tabliye
Mama yer granmer aster fam devwe
Loga quickly understood the need to keep a balance between our family and social responsibilities and the local, regional and international gender activist kept her mother, grandma and wife apron alive.
Aster nou toulede nou ase vie
78 an lor zepol Loga
80 banane foul lor pou mwa
Lasante nou 2 toultan lok-loke
Me kapav tini pa gagn drwa plengne
Today we are quite old. She is 78 and I am 80 and health wise there are problems but we can’t complain.
Kisannla pou al premie li ou mwa
Kan mo pans tousa tristes anvlop mwa
Ki pou ariv li si enn gramaten
Li pa pou tann bonzour gate to bien
Ki pou ariv mwa si enn gramaten
Mo pa trouv sourir ki dir mwa bonzour
Kouma depi swasant an toulezour
Who will go first? How will she feel if one morning she does not hear, “Good morning, love! You’re, okay?” How will I feel if one morning the smiling face is no more?
O Visnou-Zezi Bondie nou lamour
Apel nou 2 anmemtan pou touzour
Oh Vishnu-Jesus, our God of Love, please call us both back to you together, at the same time, forever.

ENN SONET POU DR. JUGATPAL
“Nou pa avoy ros lor pie ki touni
Me nou tap kout ros lor bann pie garni
Ar bann zoli fri ki nouri lespri.”
Sa zoli proverb ki later Kreol
Finn donn nou kado pa’nn rant dan lekol.
Akoz samem, Bhay, Tilespri Primer,
Gran Sef Palabrer, exper fann rimer
Gagn nisa apar vomi zot egrer.
Pa les bann nenport angourdi lespri,
Paraliz aksion pou anpes zordi
Ek dime kone kot laverite.
Gran mazorite pe bien apresie
Zoli travay ki ou ek ou koleg
Ti, finn, pe, pou fer. Non! Nou pa aveg!
“We don’t hurl stones at a bare tree
But at one full of fleshy fruit,
Body-and-Soul-nourishing food.”
Our Creole land thus teaches us
What our schools do deny us.
This is why, brother, nitwits
Gossip-prone and rumour-mongers
Ejaculate their bitterness.
Don’t let cretins poison our lives,
Thwart action to prevent the-now-
and-ever know where the truth lies.
Good people do appreciate
The good job which is being done.
Blinded folly will never see!

3 STEPS TO HEAVEN
(Muhje maaf kar do, Eddie Cochran)
Some opportunists, who have the habit of putting the cart before the horse (MET SARET DIVAN BEF), are vociferously claiming the use of Mauritian (Mauritian Creole), the de-facto national language of Mauritius, in the Legislative Assembly (L.A). Most of them do not speak the language properly, cannot read or write the quasi-standard orthography and do not want to learn either for they think it is broken French for oral use only. Since 1967, I have been militating for the use of Mauritian and have almost completed all basic preparation works. Dear readers, please remember the following facts: When a group of people speaking DIFFERENT languages live, work and play in ONE specific place, they create a new ‘speech’ to enable interlanguage communication. In its initial stage, it is very basic phonologically, syntactically and lexically. That stage is called ‘PIDGIN’. With time, children of parents speaking two different languages will use this speech as their mother tongue, their L1. As a consequence, the language becomes better structured and its vocabulary expands. It is no longer a pidgin and has become a CREOLE. There are over 100 creole languages in the world. Sango, a creole language, is the national and official language of the Central African Republic; Afrikaans, another creole language, is one of the national languages of the Republic of South Africa; English, the quasi-universal language, is also a creole language. Yes, it is! As a creole is a stage in the development of certain languages, it is reasonable to give it the name of the people speaking it when it has reached a high level of development and is the mother tongue of most people. In the Maritime Republic of Mauritius, THREE creole languages are spoken: English, Mauritian and Rodriguan. Prior to the introduction of Mauritian in our parliament, some preliminaries are necessary.
• The constitution must be amended to raise Mauritian and Rodriguan to the status of national languages while English remains the official language;
• Mauritian and Rodriguan should become media of instruction, not to be confused with optional languages;
• BILINGUAL LITERACY in Mauritian and English in Mauritius and Rodriguan and English in Rodrigues must become a core subject;
• The constitution, standing order and other fundamental laws must be translated into Mauritian and Rodriguan;
• Ministers, MPs and L.A head and personnel must be given a crash course;
• The orthography of Mauritian and Rodriguan must be updated;
• The state must sponsor the compilation of a bilingual English-Mauritian dictionary;
• The Hansard must be made trilingual (English, Mauritian and French).
Mauritian in Parliament will thus become a fundamental step in true nation building.
WE NEED LEADERS AND TEACHERS, NOT AVENGERS
What is an avenger? It is a person who does harm to or punishes someone who has done something bad, especially to the person’s family and friends (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/avenger). Avengers take the law in their own hands and believe in the policy of ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth (la loi du talion). When Jesus, an avatar of Vishnu, has taught us the importance of love and mercy, these self-appointed sheriffs prefer to exacerbate the beast instinct in people.
No sir, we need genuine leaders and teachers, not blood-thirsty avengers.
TOUT CE QUI BOUGE EST ROUGE?
We now have a new generation of so-called politicians and bouncers turned leaders, who trust in short-term activism without a long-term project. Let us remind them that a few vulgar slogans like ‘bour li deor’ will never help us to build a better world. Changes do not take place by magic or at the click of fingers. They are not the fruits of spontaneous activism but the result of a clear vision, long-term strategic planning, systematic work at tactical level. Independence in the 60’s, the victory of workers against austerity and wage freeze, the introduction of free secondary education in the 70’s are all the work of dedicated and hardworking leaders who went the whole hog to meet their objectives. They are not the achievement of a few hot-head loonies.
The three steps to heaven are NOT 1. demagogy and shallow slogans, 2. revenge and messy thinking and 3. spontaneous and aimless activism BUT 1. clear and lucid thinking, 2. love and mercy and 3. planned and organised development.

MORIS MARI MALAD(MMM)
(WHO CARES?)
There once was a man
Bought a pair of specs
To be literate
As it did not work
Took the case to court
There are several avowed and unavowed opinions in relation to illiteracy:
• Most people are too stupid to master literacy skills;
• Literacy is useful only for office work;
• Universal functional literacy means shortage of manual workers;
• Literacy gives power to an elite.
For these reasons, money-grabbing business, vote-buying politics and arse-licking socioculturalism are not bothered by literacy issues. And yet the written word is one of the greatest human creations and the hallmark of civilisation.
In MMM, we prefer to ignore this. Preference is given to money and power and although we have the resources to build UNIVERSAL FUNCTIONAL BILINGUAL LITERACY (UFBL), we prefer to opt for the short-term-wasteful-easy-way-out. GLORY TO THEE!
And you know what? In the growing economy, vacancies cannot be filled as the thousands of male and female unemployed and unemployable illiterates are not skilled in any task that demands training and competence. Gone are the days of the pure one-to-one oral training involving craftsmen and apprentices. Modern ONGOING professional training needs the support of functional literacy. … KOUT LEPE DAN DILO?
FOOD SECURITY (FS)
Together with literacy, food security is a major problem but, as usual, money-grabbing, vote-buying and arse-licking blind us all. WE REFUSE TO GROW WHAT WE EAT AND EAT WHAT WE GROW.
And worse, oh worse, MMM has a very high rate of diabetes and obesity. Moris mari malad, mo mam (MMMMM)! Baprrebap!
Food security also means a new food culture for the Mauritius Creole Archipelago (MCA). After an attempt to make of Mauritius ‘LA PETITE FRANCE’, which was bound to fail, now the HINDUTVAWALAS want MCA to become CHOTA BHARAT (Little India). Food security in terms of production and consumption is to be buried in the rubble of ill-digested ancestral cultures.
And you know what? With GLOBAL BURNING ,CLIMATE CRISIS and RISING SEA LEVEL, food shortage and scarcity will sweep across continents.
Should we wait for famine before we start to think and act? PA POU ENA NI LEPE, NI DILO SANNKOUTLA!

SONET ANT PARET EK ‘ET’
Dan gran paradi marsandiz toufet
Tou seki paret samem mahafwet.
Si ou pa rant priz dan ou moul parfet
Savedir, monwar, ou net bisiklet.
Napa kas latet si lasiet dan det;
Seki plis roket se seki paret:
Makiyaz faset, kwafir lor latet,
Tatouaz manset ziska labraget.
Ki mo ete? Ala to bet!
‘Et’ napa vo seki paret.
Seki kasiet res dan twalet,
Seki vizib lerwa dan fet.
Si to’le get veritab tret,
Louk seki ‘et’ vremem kasiet.

Joshua fought the battle of Jericho
And the walls came tumbling down.
Mo anset ti plak lame lapentir
Lor parwa lakav pou dir lavenir
Pa bliye, zanfan, mo’si mo ti la,
Pe tras sime zeping pou vinn tous twa.
Lar li swa angaze ousa li pa.
Mikelanz lor plafon Sistinn dir twa
Fer zefor, zanfan, pou ki to ledwa
Tous ledwa Bondie – samem paradi;
Pa les bachara deklar Zezikri.
Lar li swa angaze ousa li pa.
Ton Pablo Pikaso pa ti dir twa,
Dan Gernika, napa les bann fatra
Toro kraz seki seval finn kree
Pou biennet limanite anantie?
Lar li swa angaze ousa li pa.
Zordi ki nou trouve partou kote?
Lanez Kilimannjaro vinn dilo;
Lapli pe tonbe lor lanez Polnor;
Lamer demonte pe aval laplaz.
Lar li swa angaze ousa li pa.
Enn sans Ratna la pou dir bann fatra
Aret touy zanfan Bondie; fer mofinn

Tous ledwa Bondie lor plafon Sistinn.

03 SAKILI
Tou ki vini, grandi, fini
Depi start ziska touni.
Me ena ki kwar ki roupi
So lavi toultan pou tini.
Roupi pa fini fer piti
Dan koko pouri tilespri;
So patri pa nouri pie fri;
Pie friyapen zame fleri.
So kichirri, so satini,
So dalpouri, so jilebi,
Moulouktani ek sabrani
Pe fourni diri King Roupi.
Roupi pa fini fer piti
Dan koko pouri tilespri;
So patri pa nouri pie fri;
Pie friyapen zame fleri.
Lapeti roupi li verni
Gabari zeni Santipi
Ki beni san zame fini
Diri-kari ki arondi.
Roupi pa fini fer piti
Dan koko pouri tilespri;
So patri pa nouri pie fri;
Pie friyapen zame fleri.
Sakili! Pa ena lot li!
Ranpli deksi! Soufle poukni!
Nou manz li kri! Roupi ranpli
Lavi-lespri ar fri beni.
Roupi pa fini fer piti
Dan koko pouri tilespri;
So patri pa nouri pie fri;
Pie friyapen zame fleri.
That’s what it is
Everything has a beginning and an end
Except for King Rupee
Which grows and grows
Everlastingly
It is now everything and everywhere
And controls all

Kasiet lor dan kofor
Kofor dan satofor
Satofor dan fortres
Fortres dan laminn lor
Kot zom for trouv lamor
Anset antik ti servi lor
Pou selebre lao for-for
Zordi servi lor pou kraz kor
Lor nouri mersener
Ki soutir bann vanpir
Protekter lanpir pir
Ki lanfer kreatir
Pe soufer lor later
Anset antik ti servi lor
Pou selebre lao for-for
Zordi servi lor pou kraz kor
Bann sofer tren trezor
Zot desid ki nou sor
Ena tor peyna tor
Zot zis konn kraz nou kor
E pous bor ar lamor
Anset antik ti servi lor
Pou selebre lao for-for
Zordi servi lor pou kraz kor
Gold which was once used to
Celebrate Divine Greatness
Is now a craze
Driving us crazy
It corrupts all
Leaders as well as the led
It is the main source of misery
06 LI TANN ZIS LAFLIT BONJE
Soley leve soley kouse
Lesiel riye bann niaz boude
Lapli tonbe divan soufle
Li li tann zis laflit Bonje
E li ere pa badine
Me so vwazen ek so kouzen
Zot toulede prefer bigoul
Misie Roupi exper pik poul
Li kontan tann sante zwazo
Lor so pie mang so pie koko
Li kontan get bann tizako
Manz detrwa fri apre dodo
San fer zoro rod silefo
Me so vwazen ek so kouzen
Zot toulede prefer bigoul
Misie Roupi exper pik poul
Li kontan sant ar nouvo plant
Ki sarye fler ek fri dan vant
Dantle plen ar bann promes lant
Parfen lamant ki rant dan tant
Anba latant mem dan lapant
Me so vwazen ek so kouzen
Zot toulede prefer bigoul
Misie Roupi exper pik poul
S-He prefers the divine flute
Songs of birds on trees
Colourful plants and flowers
Nice smell of herbs
But her-is neighbours and friends
Prefer the harsh business trumpet
07 TOULEZOUR
Toulezour li’alim kanf ek sanbrani.
Dan kirrtann ek dan bajann
Li sonn jal, li tap dolok.
Toulezour li koup pie pou plant beton.
So vwazen pa enn krwayan;
So kouzen pa pratikan.
Sa de la toulezour zot plant enn pie.
Toulezour li alim so labouzi
Dan legliz ek lasapel.
Li exper ki bizen fer.
Toulezour li koup pie pou plant beton.
So vwazen pa enn krwayan;
So kouzen pa pratikan.
Sa de la toulezour zot plant enn pie.
Dan masjid rekta, toule-Vandredi.
Toulezour li fer namaz;
Li konn lapriyer par ker.
Toulezour li koup pie pou plant beton.
So vwazen pa enn krwayan;
So kouzen pa pratikan.
Sa de la toulezour zot plant enn pie.
Dan Manndirr, Legliz, Moske, toulezour
Zot dimann Bonje donn zot
Lasante ek lamone
E fer zot komers dibwa friktifie.
Zot vwazen pa bann krwayan;
Zot kouzen pa pratikan.
Me zot tou, toulezour zot plant enn pie.
Everyday they go to church
Bend their knees to pray
Know all prayers by heart
Light diyas and candles
And ask the Almighty
To bless their timber business
While their non-believing
And non-practising neighbours
Are planting trees
08 FIZON TOUY PIZON
Kan Vishnou-Zezi okip kreasion
Zot dir kreatir pa fer divizion,
Fer preferans pou enn kalite plim:
Tou zozo zozo, zis plim pa parey.
Pizon blan, pizon nwar
Pizon rouz, pizon roz
Zot pa fer preferans;
Abitie viv ansam.
Me dan Lanpir Fizon
Sef Pizon touy pizon.
Pou Vishnou-Zezi nou tou ki isi,
Nou tou form parti kari ki nouri.
Touye pou nouri sa enn bon lespri;
Pa pou gagn enn pri e pou fer profi.
Pizon blan, pizon nwar
Pizon rouz, pizon roz
Zot pa fer preferans;
Abitie viv ansam.
Me dan Lanpir Fizon
Sef Pizon touy pizon.
Pou Vishnou-Zezi ler nou nouri nou
Nou donn nouritir lezot kreatir;
Sakenn ed so pros, prosen ek vwazen,
Toutou ek minou pou zot devenir.
Pizon blan, pizon nwar
Pizon rouz, pizon roz
Zot pa fer preferans;
Abitie viv ansam.
Me dan Lanpir Fizon
Sef Pizon touy pizon.
Vishnu-Jesus told us to look
After all birds, bees and bushes
To feed and be fed
In the universal food-chain
To live together in harmony
Alas! In Rupee Kingdom
Head of herd
Is master killer
09 KI PAYSA PE FER?
Namaste Chachi, namaste Chacha,
Mo pa gagn ale ar zestaz paysa.
Dir mwa, dir mwa ou ki nou bizen fer
Pou kal so lelan, aret nou maler?
Mo beti-beta, dan so koumansman,
Paysa ti servi pou nouri sanzman;
Pou fasilit net esanz ant dimoun
Me lespri malad finn met li lor tronn.
Namaste Chacha, namaste Chachi,
Ki nou bizen fer pou anpes Roupi
Deklar gran mari, plonz bann pov piti
Dan so tenk baydoum, dan so santi pi?
Mo beta-beti, nou tou responsab;
Pa kwar zis bannla veritab koupab.
Kan nou’nn ranz zouti pou fer enn louvraz
Me malservi li, pa deklar maraz.
Namaste Chacha, namaste Chachi!
Mo kwar nou bizen bril sato Roupi.
Pa kapav les li fann so santi pi,
Met dibri partou: pei ek fami.
Mo beta-beti, pou bat maladi
Pa kapav servi enn lot maladi;
Maladi Roupi oblize geri
Si nou aret nouri so lapeti.
Mo beti-beta pa kwar li fasil
Tegn dife Roupi! Tank kiltir ‘ena’
Dominn nou lespri, Oustad Roupaya
Pou demay difil, fer roupi tap pil.
– Dear Antie, dear Uncle
Paysa was meant to help us live
Now it’s poisoning our lives
What can we do? What can we do?
– As long as ‘having’ is thought
To be better than ‘being’
There will be no cure
10 TRWA DAN ENN
Bramma ki finn kre liniver,
Vishnou nou gran prezervater,
Siva ki servi destriksion
Pou amenn nouvo kreasion
Montre nou sime bizen pran
Pou anpes katastrof zean.
Vishnou-Zezi dir nou souvan
Pa ekout lamizik tantan
Me samem nou tou pli kontan
Parski nou pa’le get pli lwen
Ki nou nene. Pov, pov fatra!
Boukou dimoun kwar nou later,
Nou lamer zot pou la toultan
Pou zwisans-san-fren permanan;
Zot pou eternelman prezan
Pou satisfer dezir gourman
Bann konkeran Gran Liniver.
Vishnou-Zezi dir nou souvan
Pa ekout lamizik tantan
Me samem nou tou pli kontan
Parski nou pa’le get pli lwen
Ki nou nene. Pov, pov fatra!
Vishnou-Zezi pourtan ti dir
Li nou mision vey lanatir,
Protez lavi bann kreatir,
Anpes predater fer martir,
Detrir abita natirel,
Dan later, lamer ek lesiel.
Vishnou-Zezi dir nou souvan
Pa ekout lamizik tantan
Me samem nou tou pli kontan
Parski nou pa’le get pli lwen
Ki nou nene. Pov, pov fatra!
O Triple Divinity
Tell us how to avert
Global catastrophe
Vishnu-Jesus keeps telling us
To watch out
But we don’t care
We were meant to be stewards
But we’ve chosen to be
Pilferers, looters and plunderers

MORE DEMOCRACY WITHOUT CHANGE?
MORE DEMOCRACY WITHOUT CHANGE?
Democracy as we know it (bourgeois democracy) came and developed as a result of tremendous radical changes including the rise of a new class, the capitalist class who owns most of society’s wealth and means of production, and the end of the feudal system. Today capitalism has evolved into neoliberalism which means “market-oriented reform policies such as eliminating price controls, deregulating capital markets, lowering trade barriers and reducing, especially through privatization and austerity, state influence in the economy”. With globalization, a handful of filthy rich multibillionaires across the planet have ‘sovereign sway and masterdom’.
How does this affect democracy? The super-rich ensure that economic, political, social and cultural values and activities reinforce their grip on life. Democratic values are bound to decline, whether we like it or not. Let us not forget that those who wield economic power will resist any attempt to challenge the money dictatorship. In a neoliberal set-up, will democracy thrive and flourish? On the one hand there will be attempts to restrict freedoms (speech, religion, press, assembly, movement etc.) and on the other there will be more demonstrations and the expression of anger and revolt (Gilet Jaune, Me Too, Black Lives Matter, My Body My Choice etc.) and more and more people will vote with their feet (abstention). Less than 50% of the French electorate bothered to vote in 2022.
THE 60’S-70’S AND NOW
The 60s and 70s were great moments of political activism with the fight for independence and the rise of the MMM but today the atmosphere is dull and bland. All main political parties have the same ideology and outlook with the MMM madly groping in the dark for the warmth of some Vaishya-dhoti.
AND YET! There are very serious unattended issues such as the different aspects of food security, literacy and national identity. Political leaders and commentators are more attracted by some cosmetic device which leaves intact basic politics and polity.

PEI SAN NAM
Lontan-lontan ti ena enn pei
Lwenten-lwenten kot rises dan lespri
Ti boukou pli for ki rises kofor.
Dimoun ti toler san okenn zefor
Diferan kiltir, diferan pwennvi
Ki li dan legliz ousa libreri.
Enn zour enn mazisien ti sanz tousa.
Rises dan kofor li priyoriter;
Toulezot krwayans se bann envansion
Pou anpes pei vinn siperpwisan.
Depi sa zour la se lalwa paysa
Ki ti vinn lerwa parmi diniter;
Panse inik san okenn konsesion
Ti vinn enn manntra pou tou bann zanfan.
Nepli ti toler okenn diferans;
Pa pans parey ti garanti soufrans.
Depi sa zour la, asasen swami
Ti gagn grad oustad dan lakademi.

               KAN SEX TI PESE?
Ena relizion senk mil banane
Ki konsider sex kouma expresion
Siprem kreasion san okenn fosont
Ousa derapaz. O Khajurao!
Kan divinite li mal ek femel;
Kan sak Shaktimann ena so Shakti;
Kan Durga ek Shiv ansam zot fer ENN
Zis lespri malad trouv pese dan sex.
Ena relizion, ki fek mont lor tronn,
Ki rod fer nou kwar ki fam bizen res
Anba pouvwar zom parski sex femel
San lord maskilen fer boukou vilen.
Kan divinite li mal ek femel;
Kan sak Shaktimann ena so Shakti;
Kan Durga ek Shiv ansam zot fer ENN
Zis lespri malad trouv pese dan sex.
Enn sans nou ena Swami Pap Franswa
Ki ena kouraz denons ipokrit,
Ki pe sey koriz erer lepase
Ki rod fer nou kwar sex bien malelve.
Kan divinite li mal ek femel;
Kan sak Shaktimann ena so Shakti;
Kan Durga ek Shiv ansam zot fer ENN
Zis lespri malad trouv pese dan sex.
19.10.21
             KIFER KOZ MANTI?
Yer zot ti dir nou Zezi ti res prop,
Se Marimadlenn ki ti enn malprop;
Zozef ti res prop, pa ti les madam
Amenn polision dan zot relasion.
Ti servi soutann pou kasiet pilsion;
Met kouronn raket lor latet pasion.
Me miray mansonz zordi pe grene;
Li nepli kapav touf santiman vre.
Fer sanblan pa finn fouti touf LAMOUR!
Represion pa finn fouti touy LAMOUR
Ki zordi dimann so drwa ekziste.
Nepli pe kapav kasiet seki vre,
Fer paret kasiet seki nou ete:
Zanfan Bondie ki bizen liberte.

OPEN LETTER TO THE P.M
DEV VIRAHSAWMY

Date: 09.09.23
OPEN LETTER TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PRIME MINISTER
NOBLE MINDS FACE FAILURE WITH EQUANIMITY!
Dear Prime Minister,
Allow me to share with you the following observations and thoughts.
As a nation we now invest nearly 20 billion rupees every year on education. Is the money well-spent? In my humble submission, the answer is NO. Why? For more than 50 years, we have focused on quantity in terms of subject matter and accessibility to learning – not a bad thing in itself – but failed to develop national literacy deliberately confusing it with schooling. This appears clearly in the form regularly filled by the ministry of education for UNESCO. As no research has been conducted on literacy, officers simply put down the percentage of children who go to school, assuming that all schooled children do acquire literacy which includes numeracy.
Let us first define literacy. It means the ability to read, write and count. Moreover, there are 3 levels of literacy: basic, functional, and advanced.
• BASIC LITERACY means that the persons concerned can write on themselves a short grammatically correct and well-punctuated text, in the language of their choice, which tells us, in about 150 words, who they are. I think that less than 30% of the population can do this and that 70% of the population can only draw a copy of their names or use their thumb marks.
• FUNCTIONAL LITERACY means “the capacity of a person to engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective function of his or her group and community and also for enabling him or her to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his or her own and the community’s development” (UNESCO Institute for Statistics). It includes information literacy, digital literacy, and media literacy. I believe that a good S.C and H.S.C certificate (O and A level) may ensure functional literacy to holders of these certificates, i.e., about 20% of the population.
• ADVANCED LITERACY is what is required for university studies and professional activities, and it is the prestigious competency of about 10% of the population, an elite which jealously guards and protects its privileges and interests.
I will surely be accused of exaggeration. My answer is very simple: remove party symbols on ballot papers and see what happens.
WHY HAVE WE FAILED?
• In Mauritius we confuse literacy with language learning and mother tongue reality is ignored. First of all, the term ‘mother tongue’ is misunderstood and many think that it means the language of our ancestors (French, Bhojpuri, Tamil, Telugu, Cantonese etc.) or some prestigious languages (Hindi, Urdu, Mandarin Chinese). In fact, it means the language used by parents which a child starts to learn while still in the mother’s womb and the language which the child uses in his/her home and social environment.
• Here are the facts: Morisien/Mauritian (Mauritian Creole) is the mother tongue/first language/L1 of 90% of the population and the second language/L2 of the remaining 10%. It is the best medium to help our children master basic literacy after which they will learn second languages (French, Hindi etc.) more easily. But ignorance, prejudices and hysterical language loyalty are so rife that politicians prefer to avoid the issue.
• English is not only our official language but also the most important international language. Moreover, it is a ‘creole’ language which developed some 1,200 years ago when Vikings invaded England and occupied a large territory. It started as a pidgin and with time became the national/official language of the UK in the 16th-17th centuries and later the language of the British Empire and now it is a quasi-universal language.
• As our national language and our official language are both creole languages which are analytic as opposed to synthetic languages like French, Hindi or Arabic, a sound language policy would make of Mauritius the land of functional-bilingual literacy. Again, because of ignorance, prejudices, and hysterical language loyalty no government has had, so far, the courage to take the bull by the horns.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
Governments have created, to no avail, special classes (PREVOC and Extended Programme) for the thousands of our children who, after 6-10 years at school, remain absolutely non-literate and non-numerate because of a catastrophic language policy which ignores the use of our mother tongue as medium, not to be confused with language as subject.
Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and Arismetik (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.
Brotherly namaste,
Dev

DIFFERENT FACES OF GOD
(Mersi Google pou zimaz)
                            DIFERAN VIZAZ BONDIE
Dear Almighty, help me Lord!
They say I’m polytheistic
Because in my prayers
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are present.
They are the Creator,
The Preserver and
Destroyer.
They say I worship idols
Because Shiva on His Bull
In our lounge
And Ganesha in Loga’s writings
Stand out.
     Goodness gracious me!
     God of destruction?
     Contradiction in terms!
     Rather Satan or Lucifer!
No Madam! No Sir!
Well versed Hindu faith finds
Manichaeism
Repulsive and retrograde.
Life is a contradiction;
Nothing exists without its opposite;
Unity of opposites is the key to development.
Creation and destruction
Are the two faces of the same coin:
For the New to rise, the old must die.
Growth, development and progress
Are part of an ongoing process of birth and death
From the Big Bang to the Big Crunch
And to Big Bang 2.
And Vishnu the Preserver
Through different avatars (avtaar),
Be it Rama, Krishna or Jesus,
Tells us that temporary balance
Between creation and destruction
Helps the world go round.
What is here now is dynamic:
New universes are born and old ones
Simply die; our universe with its Milky Way
Is expanding
And will some day explode.
This is what well versed Hinduism is about.
I think!
                                 
Unity of opposites is the key to development.

LOVE AND THE MIRACLE OF WATER
In 1945, at the age of three, Polio robbed me of my left arm and about 70 years later PPS, Polio’s eternal accomplice, started to play havoc with my degenerating health with the result that I had to live with acute pain and difficulty to stand or walk.
I had lost all taste for things that made me what I was and helped me enjoy life. Although living in permanent pains and anguish, I realised that my wife Loga, my children, grandchildren and friends like Gerard, Christian, Myrna, Marie-Franҁoise, Bernard and others like my cousin Deva were terribly upset. SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE. But what?
My loving family and friends looked for solutions but nothing worked.
Then …
Saskia, the aqua therapy coach proposed a special programme designed for me and I was persuaded to give it a try. A few sessions were enough to convince me that the programme was helping me to face my dilemma. My problems have not disappeared but my outlook has changed. Readiness to fight, that’s me now.
Thank you LASOURS BIENNET. Thank you, Saskia and staff.

CLICHÉ VERSUS CREATIVITY
DEV VIRAHSAWMY
5, Edwin Ythier Street, Rose Hill, 71368, Mauritius
limemsa@gmail.com https://boukiebanane.com
CLICHÉ VERSUS CREATIVITY
The hoodwinking cliché “UNITY IN DIVERSITY” is the beguiling comfort zone because it helps to delude most Mauritians into believing that Mauritius is the land of cross-cultural creativity when, in fact, it consolidates COMPARTMENTALISATION.
More than 50 years after independence, we are happy to believe that we are a RAINBOW NATION (another cliché), where united multiple colours signify the alliance between creation and the CREATOR. There is no need to go any further for we live on PARADISE ISLAND (yet another cliché).
The hidden truth is that we are mostly “WALL-BUILDERS”, experts at segregation which breaks down the population into groups, sub-groups and sub-sub-groups. Any attempt at building and promoting a supra-ethnic culture, the fundamental essence of a national culture and identity, is vehemently denounced by socio-cultural ignorami as a threat to ethnic integrity. Do they really know the basic values of their ancestral cultures?
We are all immigrants on a CREOLE ISLAND, as defined by Professor Megan Vaughan in her book, “Creating the Creole Island, Slavery in Eighteenth-Century Mauritius”. The present population is made up of Indo-Creoles, Afro-Creoles, Islamo-Creoles, Euro-Creoles and Sino-Creoles. The road ahead is not towards wall-building but towards our own Battle of Jericho to trigger the massive tumbling down of walls.
Half a century after the 1968 formal independence, our country is now being recolonised, this time by India, the present 4th world economic power, with the blessing of the USA. Francophone Euro-Creole racism is now being fast superseded by Hindutva racism.
Is there any hope? Yes, there is. There are some open-minded Mauritians from different ethnic backgrounds who firmly believe that Mauritian and English, two creole languages, are the vital springboard to propel us into an authentic national culture and identity. Work has already started and will surely rapidly develop because it is linked to the greening of Mauritius through the massive cultivation of industrial cannabis, also known as hemp, and the replanting of mangrove forests to help us face climate change and improve sea-food production. The new culture also means efforts in food security based on home-grown staples such as manioc, maize, potato, sweet-potato and arrow root together with new food habits to fight overweight, obesity and pathologies such as diabetes and high blood pressure.
THIS IS THE GENUINE ROAD AHEAD!

MIND YOUR LANGUAGE 2
MIND YOUR LANGUAGE 2
A right wing, anti-Hindu section of the general population used to call Hindus ‘ZANGARNA’, a corruption of Jagannath (English: ‘Juggernaut’) which for some Hindus is another word for “GOD” or Lord Krishna. Their language was, and still is, full of scornful expressions for Hindu rituals and the aspiring leader of the dying MMM seems to relish them. Has the MMM become Mouvman ‘Milat’ Morisien? An important Hindu ritual is “PRASADA” – a religious offering in both Hinduism and Sikhism. Is this being mocked?
“Prasada (Sanskrit: “favour” or “grace”) in Hinduism, is food and water offered to a deity during worship (puja). It is believed that the deity partakes of and then returns the offering, thereby consecrating it. The offering is then distributed and eaten by the worshippers. The efficacy of the prasada comes from its having been touched by the deity. Food left by a guru (spiritual leader) is considered prasada by the guru’s followers, as the guru is regarded as a living god. All food, if silently offered to God with the proper prayers before eating, becomes consecrated and is thus considered prasada.
In Sikhism, the distribution of karahprasad, a sweet dish of wheat flour, sugar, and clarified butter, is customarily part of a worship service or of any special ceremony, such as an initiation, a wedding, or a funeral. Communal eating reinforces the ideals of social equality that are an integral part of Sikh belief.” (https://www.britannica.com/topic/prasada)
The mulatto MC (Mauritian Creole) expression used by the Hon. J. Berenger is as offensive as the word ‘mulatto’ itself.
This is only the tip of the iceberg. Many Mauritians of different origins hold the belief that MC is by nature vulgar and cannot be used in refined circles. “Zot koz gro kreol” is an expression often heard. Did not the leader of the Labour Party say that our national language cannot be used in parliament for doors will be wide open to vulgarity?
Inveterate Francophiles still call MC a patois which is a categorical refusal to give it a ‘language’ status. And to add insult to injury, they select some ‘juicy’ expressions to suggest that our national language is just some form of folklore which deserves nothing more than mockery and ridicule. It is then convenient to ignore that it is the mother tongue of 90% of the Mauritian population, is used in places of worship, is taught and studied in prestigious institutions and has the most vibrant poetic, dramatic and prose literature of the Republic of Mauritius.
MC AND SHAKESPEARE
All languages have formal/informal, polite/vulgar, refined/uncouth, sophisticated/pedestrian registers. Vulgarity reveals the nature of the speaker, not the nature of the language. Let the ‘meter-dan-zar’ (WANNABE) make known their own stupidity and bias and drown in their own muck, mental or otherwise.
On the other hand, let us enjoy the beauty of our mother tongue through the words of a great tragic hero:
Soley leve, soley kouse, sak zour
Letan ranp-ranpe, al ver dernie son;
E memwar lepase fer nou rapel
Enn ta bachara ki’nn al manz feyaz.
Tengn lalimier! Lavi enn fennsifer!
Enn ta senn dan vid. Enn zistwar ranpli
Ar tapaz, ar zestaz; enn zistwar fou
Ki pa vo enn fout.
(Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.)
Macbeth Act 5 Scene 5

POU ZANFAN MORIS
When very young, I had problems with remembering the colours of the rainbow in the right order. My schoolteacher taught me a trick. I had to learn by heart a meaningless sentence, “Richard Of York Gained Battle In Vain” – R for red; O for orange; Y for yellow; G for green; B for blue; I for indigo; V for violet.
When my 2 daughters had a similar problem, I decided on a different approach: a song in their mother tongue.
ENN BOUKE LARKANSIEL
(LIRIK EK LAMIZIK PAR DEV VIRAHSAWMY)
Kouler rouz flanbwayan pe apel banane,
Enn papiyon oranz dan lalimier dore
Pe kas poz lor fler zonn kot legliz Kaylason,
Pe kas poz lor fler zonn kot legliz Kaylason.
Enn bouke larkarsiel do mama,
Enn bouke larkansiel;
Enn bouke larkarsiel do papa,
Enn bouke larkansiel.
Zis pou twa,
Zis pou twa.
Enn seren-dikap zonn lor pie filao ver
Laba dan lesiel ble pe kontanple lamer,
Lamer ki finn marye laba ar ble fonse,
Lamer ki finn marye laba ar ble fonse.
Enn bouke larkarsiel do mama,
Enn bouke larkansiel;
Enn bouke larkarsiel do papa,
Enn bouke larkansiel.
Zis pou twa,
Zis pou twa.
Soley finn al dormi dan dilo endigo,
Lesiel finn vinn violet, li finn sanz so palto,
Bann zetwal pe briye, tou zanfan al dodo,
Bann zetwal pe briye, tou zanfan al dodo.
Enn bouke larkarsiel do mama,
Enn bouke larkansiel;
Enn bouke larkarsiel do papa,
Enn bouke larkansiel.
Zis pou twa,
Zis pou twa.
THIS IS MY SONG FOR THE CHILDREN OF MAURITIUS.

LIBERTE EK RESPONSABILITE
Morisien kontan koz so liberte me li prefer choupchap lor so responsabilite. Li pa anvi kone ki sa de kosep la zot konplemanter mem si zot de kontrer. Enn pa ekziste san lot. Lavi li enn kontradiksion; nanye pa ekziste san so kontrer; si enn eleman kontradiksion mor, lotla ‘si mor. Zot de kote mem kogn. Si enn kote disparet, kogn la disparet.
Anou get ansam manier ki serten servi nou lang nasional, Morisien. Enn lang li enn pie ki ena trwa brans: so fonolozi, savedir bann son ki nou servi pou form bann mo; so sentax, savedir regleman ki obligatwar pou nou met bann mo ansam dan enn fraz; lexis, savedir vokabiler ki lang la servi.
• FONOLOZI: Kan nou koz enn lang, nou oblize itiliz bann fonem (son) ki servi pou form bann mo. Mem si boukou lang servi alfabet Romen (Angle, Franse, Morisien ets.) zot pa servi mem seri fonem. Falepa konfonn fonem ar alfabet. Angle ek Franse servi <ch> me li pa reprezant mem fonem: konpar mo Angle ‘change’ avek mo Franse ‘change’ e ou pou konpran diferans ant alfabet ek fonem; parey pou <j> ( konpar Angle ‘July’ ar Franse ‘Julie”). Parkont Morisien servi mem fonem ki Angle (to check/cheke; joke/ jok; job/job). Dan Morisien nou pa servi <u, eur> kouma dan mo Franse ‘lune’ ousa ‘leur’. Mo Franse ‘lune’ vinn ‘lalinn’; ‘valeur’ vinn ‘valer’.
• SENTAX (gramer):
Pou endik pliryel (marker pliryel), Morisien servi ‘bann’: enn latab/bann latab. Angle servi <s> anzeneral (ena detrwa exepsion); Franse enpe plis konplike: li servi s, x, ux, ets.
Morisien ena plizier marker tan: prezan – zero marker; prezan progresif – <pe>; prezan perfektif – <finn>; pase – <ti>; pase progresif – <ti pe>; pase perfektif – <ti finn>; fitir – <pou>; pase dan fitir – <ti pou>. Angle enn tipe plis konplike; Franse li mari konplike. Anzeneral enn verb Morisien ena enn sel form exepte verb ki fini par ‘e’ kouma manze (mo manze/ mo manz dipen); enn verb Angle ena minimem 3 form (put, puts, putting), anzeneral verb Angle ena 4 form (work, works, working, worked) e bann verb iregilie ena 5 form (eat, eats, eating, ate, eaten); enn verb Franse ena plizier douzenn form. Si nou pran zis prezan verb ‘chanter’ nou pou trouv 5 form (chante, chantes, chantons, chantez, chantent).
Jennder dan Morisien ek Angle li determine par sex e li pa gramatikalize. Dan Franse jennder li gramatikalize:
garson la bon/the boy is good/le garҁon est bon; tifi la bon/the girl is good/la fille est bonne.
• ARTIK DEFINI: Lexem <la> ki plase apre nom li enn artik defini: enn latab/latab la. Dan enn fraz li kapav sanz plas: Loto la finn tom anpann/Loto ki mo finn fek aste la finn tom anpann. Akoz sa mo panse ki li enn erer servi tredinion: *loto-la finn tom anpann.
RAJO EK T.V
Bann animater tv ek rajo piblik ek prive fer boukou erer kan zot servi nou lang nasional. Zot servi li bonavini.
Olie dir ‘bann seval’ zot dir ‘bann shevo’; olie dir ‘bon repons’ zot dir ‘labonn repons’; olie dir ‘mo res lakaz’ zot dir ‘mo res lamezon’ (Eski zot kone ki ‘mezon’ li enn mo poli pou ‘loka’ (bordel)? Olie dir ‘Chombo! Pa sap lor kal’ zot kreoliz zot Franse e dir ‘Ou bezwen pran ou mal an pasians’.
Rajo ek tv ena enn gran responsabilite dan ekzersis promosion ek standardizasion nou lang nasional me malerezman mazorite bann animater/spiker/prezantater, domine par zot arogans ek prezize frankofonik, dir ki zot bizen lib pou koze kouma zot anvi. Drol sa! Kan koz Angle ek Franse bizen respekte standar fonolozi, sentax ek vokabiler me kan koz Morisien ou kapav koz kouma ou anvi. Samem zot mesaz pou lazenes? Pa bliye ki Morisien finn rant dan lekol, legliz, moske, kovil, manndirr; dan enn lavenir pa tro lwen lang ek literatir Morisien pou rant dan sinior ek H.S.C.
MBC
Stasion rajo/tv nasional so responsabilite li bien pli gran. Li bizen donn tou bann lang mem tretman. Pa bliye ki Morisien li lang maternel (L1) 90% popilasion e ki Franse li L1 3.8% e Bhojpouri li L1 5%.
Resaman mo ti avoy enn imeyl Misie Direkter Zeneral MBC. Ala ki mo ti dir li:
Dear Mr. Anooj Ramsurrun,
I wish to put on record that most newscasters who use our national language – Morisien/Mauritian Creole – for the 7.00 o’clock evening news on T.V are doing a good job with regards to the proper use of the language. However, some still fail to respect basic phonological rules.
I watch our national TV between 6.45 and 7.30 most evenings and I find shocking the attitude of Mauritian recipe tv presenters with the only exception of the ISKCON gentleman whose delivery is excellent.
I believe the MBC should see to it that those who use our language to present their programmes do make the necessary efforts to respect its phonology, syntax and lexis. Those who refuse to respect the integrity of the people’s language show no respect for the people whose mother tongue it is (90% of the population) and should not be allowed to use our national station to spit their linguistic prejudice.
MBC has the torch-bearing responsibility to ensure that all languages of the republic are properly used and must do for Morisien what the BBC did for English. You must have heard that for a long time, standard English in England was called BBC English.
I am prepared to help you, pro bono. As I’m not well, I won’t be able to come to you but I will receive with pleasure at my place those you may want me to meet.
Brotherly namaste,
Mo zis espere ki mo pa pe ‘pis dan enn violon’ e ki bann responsab media realize ki liberte ek responsabilite zot mars ansam. Pa bliye seki mo finn dir lao: Lavi li enn kontradiksion; nanye pa ekziste san so kontrer; si enn eleman kontradiksion mor, lotla ‘si mor. Zot de kote mem kogn. Si enn kote disparet, kogn la disparet.

THE HEYDAY OF PROTEST SONGS
FOR PATRICK WHO REMEMBERS
13.10.22
In 1973, a group of minority militants, feeling that the party was drifting to the right, decided to organise themselves as a left-wing group within the party to try to get the party back to its socialist and progressive track. Those who did not like this, started a vicious campaign of mud-slinging and lies to denigrate them and argued that the left-wing militants had created a new party to destroy the ‘true’ MMM and called it MMMSP. The majority of MMM old and new members and supporters rallied behind the ‘genuine’ and ‘historic’ leaders to curse the ‘traitors’.
A set of circumstances led to the development of the MMMSP which had a three-prong line of action: 1. Political education of people; 2. Organisation of workers (FTU); 3. Creation of a supra-ethnic culture with Mauritian Creole (Mauritian) playing a vital role in educating people and in providing healthy entertainment through theatre and protest songs (Group Kiltirel Soley Rouz).
FTU (Federation des Travailleurs Unis) which saw the day thanks to the hard work of Peter Craig, Alain Laridon and Shawkatally Soodhun, is still active. Political satire on stage was the fruit of the devotion to a cause by Rajoo Ramanah, Gaston Valaydon and others though they were never members or supporters of MMMSP. People still remember Li, Zeneral Makbef, Dokter Nipat and Toufann. Young artists of Group Kiltirel Soley Rouz produced several audio-cassettes which were very popular. People still remember Diego by Bam Cuttayen or Mo Mama Esklav Enn Esklav by the Joganah Brothers.
Today, I remember with great emotions all those artists who believed that a New Mauritius was possible and I say to them wherever they are, “Mersi Boukou”.
When I think of the heyday of committed theatre and protest somgs, I get emotional and nostalgic. Please forgive me!
Allow me, dear readers, to offer you my favourite song, loaded with strong emotions, once very popular, in the original and English versions. The idea of this song cropped up while I was walking behind Fareed Muttur’s coffin; the full text flowed out while I was in prison because I had challenged the ban on public meetings; my sister-in-law Micheline composed the music and sang it; later my friend, Gilbert Pounia of ZISKAKAN, translated it into Reunionese, composed a new tune and recorded it.
LASOURS
1
Sime la li bien-bien long
Sime la li bien-bien dir
Komie finn pas lor la avan mwa
Zegwi dife dan lesiel
Lapousier dan mo labous
Mo lagorz pe amar-amare
Lasours la li ankor lwen
Bien-bien fre, bien-bien kler
Lasours kot nou tou pou al bwar
2
Simitier ranpli ar fler
Kot bann frer finn depoz zarm
Sime la li pas kot simitier
Mo lavi kouma lapousier
Pou fini dan simitier
Mo lespwar zame li pa pou tengn
Pou sak flanbo ki pou tengn
Ena mil pou alime
Ziska ki sime tous lasours
3
Marenwar pe rod nway mwa
Marekaz pe rod bwar mwa
Ena kamrad ferm koste ar mwa
Me dime komie pou ena
Ler soley manz marenwar
Komie ki pa ankor vinn fler
Seki yer swar ti ar mwa
Zordi nek enn souvenir
Souvenir ki lour dan mo leker
4
Nou bizen met sime kler
Nou bizen konstrir bann pon
Pous par pous, pa par pa ziska lasours
Mem si nou nou pa gagn sans
Nou zanfan va profite
Lapousier pou vinn lalimier
Lasours la li ankor lwen
Bien-bien fre, bien-bien kler
Lasours kot nou tou pou al bwar
THE FOUNTAIN
1
This hard road is mighty long
This long road is mighty hard
How many are they who’ve trodden its dust
Fiery darts are in the sky
Choking dust is in my mouth
And my throat narrows down to a gasp
The fresh fountain’s miles ahead
All so clear, all so cool
That’s where we’ll all drink our joy
2
Graveyard’s full of pretty flowers
Where pals lay down their arms
The road goes by the burial ground
My life’s just a speck of dust
Which seeks sleep in a graveyard
But hope will not blow out its light
For each light which does go out
Thousands will kindle new hope
Showing the way to the fountain
3
Darkness tries to gobble me
The swamp tries to swallow me
Some pals and I are huddling through
But tomorrow who’ll be there
When the sun sucks in the swamp
Who’s not buried in petals
Some are gone who once were here
Now only a memory
Memory that’s heavy on my heart
4
We must all clear out a path
We must all build out bridges
Step by step towards the fresh fountain
Even if we don’t get there
Our children surely will
For dust will turn into light
The fresh fountain’s miles ahead
All so clear, all so cool
That’s where we’ll all drink our joy

Kovid finn montre tou nou bann febles:
Ki li saniter ou ekonomik,

“Pa mwa sa, li sa” ki ti toultan la,
Enn sel kou finn vinn enn siper manntra
Ki donn nou tou drwa deklar nou sazes,
Akiz ek kondann ‘li’, ‘zot’ ek ‘bannla’,
Efas ‘mo’ ek ‘nou’ dan zizman bann kees.
Lezel avion finn regagn so plimaz;
Lotel pe revann so bake gonaz;
Tou bann slogan yer, ar so fos sourir,
Pe dezabiye pou fer touris zwir.
Kas pe revini! Bliye lepase!
Tourism kiltir ver? Aret radote!

IN FATHER LAVAL’S SANDAL SHOON
(DAN SANDALET PER LAVAL)
This short document is based on the assumption that illiteracy in the republic is a major problem although schooling is free and accessible to all (in theory) and that Afro-Creoles are the hardest hit by it for socio-economic reasons. Should you feel that this is a grotesque exaggeration, discard it. Otherwise, share it with those you think may help.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
1. Introduce a new teaching method to be known as Bilingual Literacy which combines grammar-translation and direct methods to teach Mauritian Creole (Kreol Morisien) and English simultaneously for a few ‘periods’ per week. This is possible because English is also a Creole language and the two languages share many syntactic features. Experience has shown that the system has worked with learners who after 7 years of primary schooling have remained non-literate and non-numerate. That new method could be introduced in what has now replaced PREVOK. It will accelerate the development of oracy, literacy and numeracy in Kreol Morisien (KM) and English, two examinable subjects.
2. Develop a LEVEL 1 LITERACY COURSE for adults. Learners will learn 4 subjects – KM, English, French and Maths – the target standard being Primary School Achievement Certificate (PSAC). Bilingual literacy will be used to promote oracy and literacy in English and KM.
3. LEVEL 2 LITERACY COURSE for adults may offer the same subjects with the target standard being National Education certificate (NEC).
The book WI ENN TI PEI ME ENN GRAN LAVI, sections 2 and 3 (p39-157), may be of some help.

Ed to zanfan dan gran difikilte
Pa zis parski li malad
Me sirtou parski,
Par milie, bann zanfan
Sof ban lekol pandan plis ki dis banane
San kapav lir ek ekrir,

Zot prop lang maternel
Ek zot prop lang ofisiel.

OUVER LIZIE TANG
MAKE THE BLIND SEE
For Mr. & Mrs. P.M who successfully put into practice the main tenet developed in this paper. Their adopted son has been saved.
INTRODUCTION
Primary schooling became free and accessible in 1954 and secondary schooling was made free for all in 1976. Yet less than 30% of our population can read, write and count. Over 70% are either semiliterate or downright non-literate and non-numerate.
Literacy does not mean being able to draw your name on a piece of paper or recognising the figures 0-9 to use a mobile phone. If you can write a few well-punctuated and grammatically-correct sentences about yourself, in the language of your choice, then you may be considered as one who has mastered basic literacy but to be functionally literate you must have “… the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts.” ( https://gaml.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/4.6.1_07_4.6-defining-literacy.pdf )
In the Republic of Mauritius, official figures on literacy cannot be trusted for there is a deliberate policy to hide the truth by defining literacy as ‘SCHOOLING’. Only about a quarter of our children manage to acquire basic literacy skills after 6 years of schooling. The official pass rate cannot be trusted for several reasons:
• The pass mark is in the neighbourhood of 30 marks after standardisation. Raw marks are lower and 20 marks may become 30-35 after standardisation.
• Multiple choice questions and one-word-answer questions carry 50 marks. It must be borne in mind that by just throwing the dart or by making a good guess, candidates may score up to 20 marks.
• A very great number of candidates are unable to tackle open-ended questions, sentence and essay writing.
ARE OUR CHILDREN “KATARS” (NITWITS)?
Certainly not! An absurd language policy is the main reason why our children find the school environment alien and hostile. Our narrow-minded, blind, timorous and self-seeking political leaders from all quarters have so far failed to understand the meaning of ‘mother tongue’ which should not be confused with ‘ancestral language’. They should read the works of Alfred Thomatis and Stanislas Dehaene to understand the importance of our mother tongue in the development of our brain. Worse still is the fact that they think that Mauritian (the most suitable name for Mauritian Creole, the first language, L1, of 90% of the population and the second language, L2, of the remaining 10%) is a corrupt form of French – broken French. They do neither know what a creole language is nor do they know that English is a creole language. Moreover, they confuse the term ‘medium of instruction’ with languages taught as subjects. The absence of the right initial medium of instruction is responsible for the disastrous situation our system of education is facing.
What a shame! In a recent past, it has been clearly shown that the right language policy can yield spectacular results. 200 young boys and girls who had flunked the then CPE twice, were given a special course based on mother tongue literacy and, 3 years later, over 150 of them passed the National Certificate of Education (NCE) and most of them today are skilled workers and literate citizens.
SPEECH, READING AND WRITING
As a result of evolution, the creature called ‘Homo sapiens’ is genetically programmed to use language orally and in their (his or her) brain there is an area responsible for this faculty, known as Broca’s area. But nowhere is there an area for the production and use of literacy which is realised when a person manages to build, in their (her or his) brain, a bridge between their Broca’s area and their visual fields. In other words, learning to speak a language comes naturally but learning to read and write your L1 is an arduous task requiring much effort and support from parents and teachers. Imagine the difficulty of our children who are asked to master literacy in 2 or 3 foreign languages (in English, French and an ancestral language) while their L1 is ignored. Add to this, the fact that in over 75% of cases, parental support is totally absent. Are our children failures? Or should we blame a system that is torturing our children and preventing them from developing their full potentials.
PA MWA SA, LI SA!
Let us not look for scapegoats! We all have our share of responsibility. Parents also are to blame. Being able to have children is, in most cases, quite natural and straight forward but looking after them is quite another business. Are adults aware of problems to be faced and are they prepared to learn or do they think that there is nothing to learn? Do they have the time or inclination to learn? Do they want real changes?
If all middle-class, lower middle-class, working-class and lower working-class parents were to take to the streets to demand the necessary changes, any government would capitulate. But since each group is thinking of its own petty interests, this will never happen.
The traditional parties share the same ideology and beliefs in this matter. We cannot expect any serious thinking from them.
The new breed of activists does not think that this issue deserves some attention. They all want spectacular and immediate popularity and success. Ce n’est pas demain la veille! IT’S NOT TOMORROW THE DAY BEFORE!
Worse, oh worse! Parents whose L1 is Mauritian, think that by using their own Frenchified gibberish, they will help their children to become ‘more intelligent’. Do these fools know that the ear is the first organ of the feotus to develop; that the child hears the mother talking, while still in the womb; that by not using the child’s L1 and language of the environment, they are hampering their normal development.
But there is hope. A couple, Mr. & Mrs. P.M, has opted for a more intelligent and suitable approach to help their ‘adopted’ son and the young boy who was thought to be a ‘katar’ (nitwit) is now recognised as ‘very bright’. He was ‘re-educated’ in his mother tongue (L1).
How many more children must we destroy before we come to realise the harm we are doing?

TOUKOREK?
Rezilta HSC finn tonbe. Selebrasion! Ledikasion finn kas rekor ledikasion. Minis ere. Rekter ere. Lagazet ere parski lavant ‘si finn kas rekor. Tou dimoun ere exepte kaser nisa kouma mwa. Ki sa bikini la pe kasiet?
Anou riwayn 7 an. An 2014 apepre 22,000 zanfan Repiblik Moris ti konpoz CPE. 7 an pli tar apepre 7,000 zenes finn pas HSC ki reprezant anviron 30% zenes ki ena apepre mem laz. Savedir anviron 70% nou bann zanfan finn elimine dan lekours lavi.
Ki ete HSC? Premierman, li endik nou sipa nou zanfan finn pare pou letid dan enn liniversite; deziemman li endik enn nivo literesi fonksionel ki zenes la posede.
Nou kapav osi dir ki anviron 5,000 zenes dan sa group laz la posed literesi bazik e 10,000 zot swa semi-literet swa non-literet. Par extrapolasion, kapav dir ki 50% popilasion Repiblik Moris pa posed ni literesi bazik, ni literesi fonksionel. Pli grav ankor, MWENS KI 33% POSED LITERESI FONKSIONEL.
Ki ete literesi fonksionel: Dapre UNESCO, li vedir, “kapasite pou servi lir, ekrir, konte pou fer fas tou bann aktivite neseser pou bon deroulman lavi dan sosiete kot ou viv (capacity of a person to engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective function of his or her group and community and also for enabling him or her to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his or her own and the community’s development)”.
Eski sa li enportan? Li ENN DRWA IMEN ki vital pou amenn devlopman entegral dan tou bann domenn (ekonomik, politik, social ek kiltirel) e permet tou bann sitwayen zwir bann bienfe sivilizasion dan egalite ek armoni.

Pa kone si nou kone ki nou’ete.
Nou viv lor later Kreol, koz Kreol
Ek manz Kreol me nou pa axepte
Ki lor later Kreol, nou tou Kreol.
Bann bourrbak yer ti kwar zot Franse pir
Ki viv dan Ti-Lafrans lwen-lwen laba;
Bann bourrbak zordi sir kouma lasir
Ki dilo Ganga sourse dan Vakwa.
Bann sorti Lafrik prefer dekrepi;
Bann sorti Bihar met lenz Larabi;
Bann sorti Bhojpour kwar zot koz Hinndi.
Personn pa’le kwar nou tou nou viktim
Ki’inn forse vinn la pou efas nou dram.
Olie dir mersi, nou nimakarram.
Nou tou nou kouma pie lafours san fler
Ki pa rekonet later nourisier,
Ki prefer avoy so rasinn dan ler
Me ki oblize desann dan later.
Enn zour pa enn zour – sa li enbarab –
Nou pou oblize aret nou palab
E asiz ansam otour mem latab.

ON FOOD SECURITY
In the late 60’s and early 70’s, when we argued in favour of food security, the Labour Party and PMSD pundits simply pooh-poohed us for sugar had a guaranteed price and market and consequently we should grow cane, produce sugar (and rum, of course), export it and with the foreign exchange buy the food we need. There was no need to change.
But the situation did change. We could not compete with beet sugar.
All mainstream parties, including the MMM, toed the line and worshipped King Sugar.
50 years later, food security is on the agenda and the MSM led government is now exploring possibilities.
It’s about time to define concepts and analyse issues.
• It is fundamental that we grow what we eat and eat what we grow but that is only part of the story.
• Food security also means “Healthy Eating”. The fast-food culture is wreaking havoc: 45% of the population are overweight if not downright obese.
• What are the pathologies associated with obesity? “A total of 89 relevant studies were identified. The review found evidence for 18 co-morbidities which met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis determined statistically significant associations for overweight with the incidence of type II diabetes, all cancers except esophageal (female), pancreatic and prostate cancer, all cardiovascular diseases (except congestive heart failure), asthma, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis and chronic back pain. We noted the strongest association between overweight defined by body mass index (BMI) and the incidence of type II diabetes in females (RR = 3.92 (95% CI: 3.10–4.97)). Statistically significant associations with obesity were found with the incidence of type II diabetes, all cancers except esophageal and prostate cancer, all cardiovascular diseases, asthma, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis and chronic back pain. Obesity defined by BMI was also most strongly associated with the incidence of type II diabetes in females (12.41 (9.03–17.06)).” (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-9-88)
FOOD CULTURE MUST CHANGE
1. Reduce the consumption of rice and wheat flour and promote the intake of locally grown staples such as potato, cassava, sweet potato, arrow root, jackfruit, breadfruit etc.
2. Avoid red meat and encourage free-range poultry and fish.
3. Increase consumption of fruits and vegetables.
4. Reduce consumption of alcohol and tobacco.
A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE
Food security is to be associated with a healthy lifestyle with plenty of exercises. We need the political will and leadership but above all we must all understand that culture makes us human but cultural sclerosis makes beasts of us all.
We can only hope that in a not too far distant future, there will be no need to sing this sad refrain:
Dal mo done,
Dourri mo done,
Kifer to finn mor
Tamby?

FOR JOONEED J? OR JOONEED K?
“We are NOT ‘All immigrants’ on the Mauritius Indocean Archipelago: the Whites came as Masters, Colonisers and Slave/Coolie Owners, the Non-Whites were brought by force as Slave and Contractual Coolie labour… They did not ‘immigrate! – except for a few handfuls of Asian merchants. This ‘We are all immigrants’ is the BIGGEST hoodwinking cliché!”  JOONEED KHAN from Canada
Dear Jooneed,
By ‘immigrant’ I mean non-native. There are 2 types of immigrants: forced and free. Slaves were forced immigrants while indentured labourers came on contract and were able to return to India at the end of their contract, which most did, while some chose to stay after having bought a small plot of land.
My great-grandparents on both sides chose to stay, work hard, and make life meaningful. I follow their steps and have chosen to make my life meaningful through ‘hoodwinking’ efforts to hoodwink myself into believing that it is possible to develop a supra-ethnic national culture.
I wish you joy in your cushy Canadian home, sharpening your plastic sword.
Brotherly namaste,
Dev

MANTI SA!
– Later ron, otour soley li tourne!
– Manti sa matlo, servi to lizie;
Get sa sime la, lamer divan twa!
Zot plat kouma farata, do fatra.
Soley lev dan les, bwar dilo dan lwes
Me nou later li bouz fix, e li les
Soley, lalinn ek zetwal admir li.
Napa les fatra kouyonn to lespri.
– Ras imen ti ne dan savann Lafrik!
– Aret to kouyonad! To fer mwa sik!
Nene plat, gro lalev, seve krepi
Sa pa nou sa! Al relir liv sakre!
Bondie dan zarden kre limanite
Lapo kler, seve blon ek lizie ble.
Bril tou to bann liv! Aret fer erer!
Satan finn avoy Kopernik, Kepler
Pou detrir travay Bondie Kreater.

2-3 GAZAL/SOME GHAZALS
DEV VIRAHSAWMY
2-3 GAZAL/ SOME GHAZALS
01: POU TWA, POU MWA, POU NOU
Ze-me-mwa, I-me-mine, mo-mwa
Samem pwazon nou douniya.
Poumwa-poutwa egal pounou
Limem lakle trezor karrma.
Kan dan done ena gagne
Nou lekzistans dir “Mwa ki la!”
Kan biennet lotla enportan
Nou aret fer nou sinema.
Kan kreasion donn devlopman
Pa enn me tou, vre tamasa!
Zezi ti vinn dir nou tousa
Me nou prefer enn lot lavwa.
(when I-me-mine is king
something important is missing
the key to happiness is sharing
but we prefer not to remember
what Jesus told us)
02: POU DIR MERSI
Saraswati finn tranp mo plim
Dan enn polank kouler siblim;
Vishnou finn ranz fraz Morisien
Ar douser lekleraz lalinn;
Trimourti, Tridevi, Zezi
Finn aroz lavi ar sennbim;
Mo finn konn lamour, lamitie,
Boner, sekirite, lestim …
Mem si vieyes ek maladi
Bes mo bobes, li pou enn krim
Bliye mo devwar lezitim
Desinn sourir mem enpe dim.
(I have been given so much
that I am duty-bound
to give back as much
if not more
thank you my good Lord)
03: GET ENVIZIB
Mo seve Malbar, to seve pikpik;
To seve lalwes, mo seve Lafrik.
Mo vwazen pe dir pa kapav kontan
Parski gat nasion pe fer malefik.
Tou seki fizik pronons diferans;
Resanblans kasiet dan metafizik.
Les zot palabre, zot kontan zaze!
Ti pikir moustik pa pou touy mistik.
Mo lamour pou twa, to lamour pou mwa
Samem gran kado nou Senier Mazik.
Vishnou vinn Zezi, Zezi vinn Vishnou
Pou fer liniver vinn plis manifik.
(because we are different
they say it cannot be love
what is visible conceals
what, in fact, is most alike
Vishnu-Jesus taught us this
but we do not remember)
04. ZOT ENA MEM SEX ME …
Zot ena mem sex me zot’le marye;
Komeraz zaze, dir zot pe fane.
Maryaz oblize donn nesans zanfan;
Pa koz adopte! Zame ti konte!
Dan zarden-Dedenn finn fer nou konpran
Sa pa lamour sa! Sa se pitasie!
Me zot pe prefer lir Kama Soutra
Ki montre sime pratik malelve.
Kan nou Pap Franswa koz zanfan Bondie
Zot fer koumadir zot pa pe tande.
Zot prefer lamour fini simitier
Ki lamour fleri dan enn lot manier.
(just because they are non-binary
gossip thrives
sex must give new life
otherwise it’s a waste
read Genesis,not Kama Sutra
forget Pope Francis
and love which grows differently)

FOUKA 2022
FOUKA 2022
(THE NUTTY 2022)
1. BIZEN SANZMAN?
Tou dimoun dimann sanzman;
Sanzman finn fini vini
Me personn pa pe trouve.
Lontan-lontan ti ena
Enn mouvman ki ti fizionn
Mouvman Militan Malbar,
Mouvman Militan Mouslim,
Mouvman Militan Makaw,
Mouvman Militan Milat,
Mouvman Militan Madras,
Mazanbik ek Marati
Pou fer Nasion Larkansiel.
Tou dimoun dimann sanzman;
Sanzman finn fini vini
Me personn pa pe trouve.
Mouvman Militan Moris
Li pa ti zis sosialis;
Li ti kont kominalis.
Me bien vit li ti sanze
Pou li vinn so prop kontrer.
Li finn vinn Mouvman Gran B…:
Berenger, Bagwan, Badain,
Bodha, Boolell ek Bruneau.
Tou dimoun dimann sanzman;
Sanzman finn fini vini
Me personn pa pe trouve.
03.01.22
WE NEED CHANGE?
Do we need change? Not really! Change has already taken place. The socialist and anti-communalist Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) has become Beautiful Bastard Bunch (BBB) led by Berenger, Bhagwan, Badain, Bhoda, Boolell and Bruneau. What more can you wish for?
2. LIDER SITWAYEN
Dan ti paradi Losean Endien
Li extra fasil sanz realite.
Nek bizen sanz nom pou zafer sanze;
Pran zi margoz, apel li fangouren,
Lor vites amer vinn mari sikre.
Bann taper lontan finn gagn nouvo tit;
Zot apel bawnser, aktivis sosial.
Zot rev maroken, mem latet dan pit;
Zot sir ki dime, zot pou vinn, mal-mal,
Depite, si konn rant premie dan bit.
Lider sitwayen pa diskrimine:
Kapitalis, sosialis mem zafer;
Miliarder, proleter, somer, droger,
Voler, violer, monper ek misioner,
Zot tou mem parey dan egalite.
Lider sitwayen kwar dan so mision:
“Nou bizen konbat diskriminasion!
Travayer maniel, travayer biro,
Travayer sexiel ek kourtie bordel¹
Tousa mem lasos ar mem masala.”
Lider sitwayen kwar limem bondie
Ki napa get dimoun ar de lizie.
Tou dimoun dimoun, pa bon divize.
Bondie pa kontan kan fer preferans,
Pran par enn ti group kont tou lezot zans.
Bann nouvo sover la pou fer plezir
Ki ou dominer, ki ou domine;
Ki ou krazer kor, ki ou gagn kraze.
Nou pa kone kan zot rol pou mike
Me bann fodevo pou zwenn. SA MO SIR!
¹expresion poli pou”makro loka”
03.01.22
CITIZEN KING
A new budding fashion in politics is to steer away from ethnic and class politics and to put all citizens in the same basket. Predators and victims, exploiters and exploited, sex-workers and brothel keepers are part of the same humanity. How long will this last?
3. LIBERTE SAN LIMIT?
Dan mo ti pei omilie dilo
Tou dimoun zot kwar ki zot liberte
Ek tou zot bann drwa napeyna limit.
Falepa ou kwar latet finn gagn fit.
Kan koz devwar-responsabilite,
Mouvman siywayen so disan vinn so.
Dan mo ti pei ar so gro poumon,
Bann rezo-sosial, zoli enstriman
Pou koul beton dan solidarite,
Finn vinn bien vit lagazet sifon ble
Pou fann rimer, zet labou, fann pikan² ;
Enn nouvo sime pou difamasion.
Dan mo ti pei ar so leker sal,
Servi liberte pou ki Gran Faner
Gagn lantenn pou zoure ek difame;
Pou fann labou lor madam ek misie.
Lagazet Sifon Ble, exper dan rimer,
Vann so liberte ar gran kapital.
²formel: faner pikan; enformel: faner kaka.
04.01.22
UNBOUNDED FREEDOM (UF)
UF is preferred to ignore responsibility and defame in anonymity and with impunity.
4. LIBERTE MADE IN MORIS
Dan pei Moris, telman nou kontan
LIBERTE ki nou refiz rant dan ran
Reg fonolozik, tou bann reg gramer
Ek tou bann konvansion vokabiler.
Kifer oblize servi “é” kan “e”
Pli sivilize? Pa dir “zé”, dir “zeu”!
“Garaz” sonn basklas. “Garage” pa sonn rans.
Pa ekout nenport! Servi made in Frans!
Falepa zot dir, “Ala mo vini!”
Dir plito, “Mo pe vien!” Bien pli zoli.
“Mo pe al lakaz”, sa ditou pa bon.
Kan koz prop nou dir, “Mo al lamezon”.
“Kreol enn patwa, li peyna gramer!
Li’enn batar Franse san okenn valer.
Pa ekout nenport ki deklar kone
Me anverite ki koz zis Angle.”
05.02.22
FREEDOM MADE IN MORIS
Creole is the language of freedom. It has no rules and you can speak it the way you want.
5. ZEZI
Zezi, avatar Vishnou, ti vini
Parski lemal ti pe fer gran mari
E ki ti bizen regagn lekilib
Pou prezerv lavi, kal dezir swisid.
So mesaz ti senp: “Kontan to vwazen
Parey kouma to kontan to prop twa.”
Me eski vremem to kontan to twa?
Ou plito to plis kontan enn lot ten?
Laplipar dimoun ki mwa mo kone,
Zot fer tou pou vinn lot ki zot ete.
Dres ek tenn seve; lapo nwar vinn gri;
Kasiet natirel ar nouvo prodwi.
Avatar Vishnou finn pas dan pake:
Enn Palestinien dorizinn finn vinn
Foul Eropeen avek lizie ble,
Seve blon, lapo blan san okenn ginn³.
³depi mo Bhojpuri ‘ghin’ ki vedir ‘maloker’.
07.01.22
JESUS
Can we love others if we do not love ourselves? No! Do not confuse this with self-love. As a consequence, Vishnu’s avatar, born in Palestine, who taught us to “love thy neighbour as thyself” has been metamorphosed into a blue-eyed, blond-haired European because we are unable to accept what we really are and what reality really is.
6. KIFER SA?
Dan kolez lefrer, zot ti rakonte
Ki Marie-Madlenn ti enn prostitie;
M.M ti apel Zezi “Rabouni”
Parski sa vedir “Gran Senier Beni”
Me ti bliye dir ki mo ‘rabouni’
Li vedir osi “Mo gate-sheri”.
Kifer sa?
Aster kot gete, zot pe rakonte
Ki Senier Zezi, ‘avatar Vishnou’,
Pa ti’ena Shakti, relasion sexiel.
Li ti enn enik? Veritab sadou?
Ram ti’ena Sita, Krishna so Radha
Me Zezi Vrezom pa ti’ena soukdou.
Kifer sa?
Mathie dir nou, apre nesans Zezi,
Zozef ek Marie ti viv ‘normalman’
Lavi konzigal me dapre serten
Marie ti res vierz. Pourtan so mari
Detrwa zan pli vie pa ti’ena problem.
Zezi ti’ena frer? Ena ki dir non.
Kifer sa?
08.01.22
WHY?
Why do they say that Mary Magdalene (M.M) was a prostitute and deny the love between Jesus and M.M? Why do they deny that Joseph and Mary (both between 15 and 19 yrs old) lived as normal husband and wife? Why Oh Why?
7. AVATAR
Avatar, enn konsep Endou
Senp, presi, san okenn bagou,
Dir nou ki Bondie pa bizen
Zistwar mirak pou ti zanfan
Pou vinn lor later kan bizen
Pez enn gran kout fren, kas leren
Bann ki finn may lavi dan lak
E fer bann imen manz pounak.
Nesans vierz-mirak ekziste
Dan mitolozi sosiete
Lafrik, Lazi kouma Lerop.
Kan ena irzans Li paret
Kot-kan bizen met partou prop
E swazir kouma disparet.
09.01.22
AVATAR
The Hindu concept of avatar is simple and precise. God, at any time, may take a human shape to help mankind to sort out the mess they are in. There is no need to concoct stories of miracle or virgin birth. Please note that such stories are found in different cultures, all over the world.
8. MO ZARDEN
Ti’ena enn zarden damilie dan bwa
Kot ti’ena kat pie draze kat kouler:
Pie draze kouler rouz, ble, zonn ek ver.
Sak pie ti ena so prop koloni
Mem kouler draze ki ti nouri li.
Sak koloni mous pa ti konn lot ki
So prop pie draze. Fale pa baba
Sort depi to pie. Samem fer maler.
Dife dan langka! Enn aswar lete,
Siklonn rachas ti dezabiy tou pie;
Bann koloni mous ti desid lager
Pou detrwa draze ti’nn tom lor later.
Lerla enn lavwa ti sort dan lesiel
Dir zot tou aprann servi zot lezel.
“Olie res lao, desann net anba
E zot pou trouve ki sa kat pie la
Zot pran zot manze dan mem katora.”
10.01.22
MY GARDEN
There was a little garden where four sugar-almond trees of red, blue, yellow and green fruits, hosted each a colony of similar flies. One night, a violent cyclone laid bare all the trees. There was famine and fights started. A voice from heaven told them to look at their roots for all trees feed from the same earth.
9. MO PIE MANG
Mo pie mang ti ne san personn kone
E san fer tapaz donn lakaz lonbraz;
Li donn nou so fri pou zasar, koucha;
Pou aranz kari, fer deser maha.
Mem mo bann vwazen boufonn so bataz,
Dir li li grosie, pa donn zoli fler
Ki ena zot plas dan bann diksioner,
Li res silansie, les letan pase.
Bann pie dideor dan lakour vwazen
Koumans transpir gro akoz lasesres,
Sanzman klimatik, divan siklonik.
Pie mang pa panik, tini so leren,
Plonz so rasinn net san fer okenn zes
Parski li kone so lafors mazik.
11.01.22
MY MANGO TREE
My mango tree came naturally. It never looks for favours and gives itself freely. My neighbours’ haughty imported trees (NHIT) do mock my uncouth tree which remains quiet. Why not?
When draught, cyclones and climate crisis start to hit, all NHIT give up the fight. Not my mango tree.
10. ROUPI KARE IZ KING
Enn gran mazisien finn fer enn paspas,
Kre roupi kare kouler larkansiel
Telman atiran ki limanite
San gete, finn plonz net latet-lipie
Parski nou tann dir ar roupi kare
Kapav aste kash enn plas premie klas
Dan paradi san rant dan enn lenpas
Ki li lor later, ki li dan lesiel.
Me laverite, roupi kare la
Li pli pir ladrog e plis ou gagne
Plis ou pou rode ziska ou trangle.
Akoz nou lamour pou roupi kare
Nou pe fer later vinn karo brile
E fer dime vinn dezer Sahara.
11.01.22
RUPEE IS KING
Square rupee is the new craze to buy prosperity and posterity but in fact it is the road to perdition.
POU DIR LAMOUR
11. ZOLI VIZAZ LAMOUR
Anzeneral, kan nou koz lamour,
Nou pans zis lamour ant zom ek fam
Me lamour ant de zom ou de fam
Sawsi enn vizaz lamour imen.
Me lamour li boukou plis ki sa!
Lafami li enn lot nik lamour:
Lamour ant bann paran ek zanfan;
Lamour bann zanfan pou zot frer-ser
Pou paran, granparan, bann tonton
Bann tantinn, bann kouzen, bann kouzinn.
Me lamour li boukou plis ki sa!
Nou vilaz, nou lavil, nou pei
Zot donn nou ek nouri nou lamour.
Mem si ti bizbiz fer nou sagren,
Nou kone nou bizen viv ansam.
Lanatir lor later, dan lamer
Fer parti lanvironnman lamour.
Me lamour li boukou plis ki sa!
Dan lesiel ki vizib ek lesiel
Envizib ena enn lot lamour
Ki boukou plis extra, mo dir twa.
Li peyna koumansman ni lafen!
Se lamour Zezikri ki dir nou:
“To bizen kontan to bann vwazen
Mem fason ki to kontan tomem.”
To vwazen li pa zis to fami.
To vilaz, to distrik, to pei.
Li boukou plis ki sa. Pa bliye
Dimoun pov ki soufer lor later,
Pa bliye to planet ki malad
Akoz nou prop erer ek defo.
Lamour li pa zis enn emosion,
Enn pasion ki vit tengn lor lili.
Li tousa e ankor plis ki sa!
13.01.22
A MANY-SPLENDORED THING
Han Suyin is right. This is what love is.
12. KI VEDIR LAMOUR?
Apart lamour pou Bondie,
Ki vedir lamour?
Zezi donn nou so repons:
Kontan to vwazen
Kouma to kontan tomem.
Me pou kontan to vwazen,
Pou kontan Bondie,
To bizen kontan tomem.
Eski fasil sa?
Si to kwar to tro nwar,
Ousa to tro blan;
Bizen kasiet seve blan,
Bizen kasiet rid;
To kwar to nene tro plat,
Lalev tro epe;
Lekor mannken perdi form
Akoz fraka laz;
Get dan laglas enn martir,
Fer gagn sierfrwad …
Prev to pa kontan tomem.
To zalou lezot,
Enposib to kontan zot.
Eski to kontan bann pie
Ki donn oxizenn?
Ousa to prefer koup zot
Pou vann zot dibwa?
Eski to kontan zwazo
Lor to bann pie fri?
Ousa to touy zot parski
Zot gat marsandiz?
To pa kontan lafore;
Karo kann tamam;
Lasemine pli zoli,
Donn boukou roupi.
Montagn fors nou fer detour;
Prefer fouy tinel;
Tinel fer pitay rantre;
Donn boukou granit
Pou fer blok ek makadam.
Bann lafore mangliye
Enn gran gaspiyaz;
Laplaz pou bronzaz touris,
Sa ki neseser.
Kan to prefer lamone
Dan plas kreasion;
Kan to kraz louvraz Bondie
Pou priye Mamon,
To leker pa pou kapav
Resevwar lamour
Bondie, ni lamour imen.
Si dan balans lamone
Pli lour ki lamour,
Savedir kriz klimatik
Ek so pandemi
Pou kontinie fer mari
E met andanze
Seki Bondie finn kree
Par lamour pou nou.
Ki mesaz Bondie Zezi?
Fode dan balans, lamour
Pez boukou pli lour.
14.01.22
WHAT IS LOVE?
To love, give and receive love, you must first love yourself which is not to be confused with self-love. It simply means that you know who you are and are not ashamed of yourself or jealous of others. You must also love God’s creation and not see it as simple goods to be bought and sold.
On the scales, love must finally weigh much heavier than money.
13. LINITE DE KONTRER
Kouma dan tou kiksoz, dan lamour
Kouma dan toulezour, si get bien,
Linite de kontrer li prezan.
Nou toultan asosie lamour ar
Lazwa, boner, biennet ek plezir
Me bliye ki lamour li kapav
Donn soufrans, fer nou larm deverse
Kan fer fas traizon, desepsion.
Lavi net li enn kontradixion:
Nanye pa ekziste si li pa
Ena so prop kontrer, pa bliye.
Lamour li pa kapav exepsion.
Rapel Romeo ek so Ziliet;
Pa bliye Layla ek so Majnun.
16.01.22
THE UNITY OF OPPOSITES
We tend to associate love with joy and happiness but love can bring suffering and tears when there is betrayal and deception.
Life is a contradiction and nothing exists without its opposite. Remember Romeo and Juliet or Layla and Majnun.
14. KI KALITE?
Kan nou pans lamour nou pans dabor
Hetero ou homo; e apre
Lamour paran-zanfan ek ser-frer
Me bien rar nou pran kont gran pasion
Mozar pou lamizik; Shakespeare pou
Trazedi, komedi, poezi;
Pablo pou so tablo Guernica;
Panini pou gramer vie Sannskrit.
Ki vedir lamour pou Narendraj?
Lafwa dan Zezikri, lafeksion
Pou Loga, bann zanfan, tizanfan;
Answit enn gran pasion pou Moris,
Lil Kreol ek so de lang kreol:
Morisien ek Angle. Samem tou.
17.01.22
WHAT ELSE IS THERE?
What is love? A feeling that binds people; a passion for things you love.
For me it is love of Christ, love for Loga, our children and grandchildren and next a passion for the Creole Island, Mauritius and its two creole languages, Mauritian and English.
15. METISAZ
Anou sante! Servi lagam sega. Swa ou konpoz enn melodi, swa ou servi melodi “Au claire de la lune”.
Nou tou bien konsian
Akoz nou erer
Nou lavi dan douk,
Me nou fer sanblan
Tou pe mars korek.
Si zafer traver
Se akoz lot la.
Pa mwa sa, li sa!
    Tanto to kone, tanto,
    Tanto to siro zanana!
Akoz nou vantar
Pa axepte tor
Nou dan marenwar.
Nou pli kontan lor,
Larzan ek dibien
Ki boner prosen.
Nou dir nou krwayan
Me ador Satan.
    Tanto to kone, tanto,
    Tanto to siro zanana!
17.01.22
MISCEGENATION
A good example of culture miscegenation: a French song sung by children is ‘segatised’ and the refrain comes straight from a sega song.
FER LATET-LIPIE
DETRWA BALAD POU NOURI LESPWAR
16. MONTAGN BERTLO
Zot finn met plat lafore;
Bous tou bann dren natirel
Pou ki masinn koup zot kann;
Pers trou partou dan lesiel,
Dan vale ek dan montagn
Pou ki touris al laplaz.
Montagn Bertlo, do matlo,
Pa bliye Jooneed ti dir
Zot plant kann lor to ledo,
Mo ledo ek nou ledo.
Montagn Bertlo, do matlo.
Zot finn koken tou later
Pou plant kann lor nou ledo;
Pou ranz site kadnase;
Lotel delix pou touris;
Vila pou larme foulous
San pans prodiksion manze.
Montagn Bertlo, do matlo,
Pa bliye Jooneed ti dir
Zot plant kann lor to ledo,
Mo ledo ek nou ledo.
Montagn Bertlo, do matlo.
Lendistri farmasetik
Dan zot lame satanik;
Bann minis zot met dan pos.
Si patron pa tro kontan
Vit-vit zot desann kalson:
“Dilwil kanabis pa bon”.
Montagn Bertlo, do matlo,
Pa bliye Jooneed ti dir
Zot plant kann lor to ledo,
Mo ledo ek nou ledo.
Montagn Bertlo, do matlo.
23.01.22
17. NWAR, NWAR, NWAR …
Set an li sof ban dan lekol,
Li touzour pa konn lir-ekrir.
Tou dimoun zot kwar li katar
Kan se so lekol ki barbar.
Nwar, nwar, nwar, nwar do mo mama,
Get kouma fer nwar.
Eh matlo! Trap to direxion,
Vir to manivel.
Gouli-dannta fer li bliye
Tortir-kosmar angle-franse;
Kan zwe kanet li konn konte;
Divan tablo, li dekone.
Nwar, nwar, nwar, nwar do mo mama,
Get kouma fer nwar.
Eh matlo! Trap to direxion,
Vir to manivel.
Ler al vote, li rod senbol;
Li kas kreyon, li devier bol;
E dan lakour Son Exelans,
Vit-vit li perdi konesans.
Nwar, nwar, nwar, nwar do mo mama,
Get kouma fer nwar.
Eh matlo! Trap to direxion,
Vir to manivel.
Li kouma enn krab trouloulou
Dan sounami finn perdi trou;
Enn parrdesi san pardesi
Ki pa kapav kasiet lapli.
Nwar, nwar, nwar, nwar do mo mama,
Get kouma fer nwar.
Eh matlo! Trap to direxion,
Vir to manivel.
24.01.22

18. DALENN AAT ANA
Nou finn vinn isi pou ras lafore,
Pou plant karo kann ek karo dite
Parski bann misie ek madam Angle
Kontan met disik dan zot tas dite.
Nou finn osi ras karo mangliye
Pou ranz gran laplaz pou bannla bronze.
Dalenn aat ana, Amorris bahout atcha!
Aat ana, baatana, kayse belona?
Nou sorti Lafrik, Danlenn ek Lasinn
Pou travay isi esklav ek kouli
Lor later kreol ki finn perdi tou
So bann laflor ek lafonn andemik
Pou ranz paradi pou pitay vakans
Ki vinn V.I.P zis pou detrwa zour.
Dalenn aat ana, Amorris bahout atcha!
Aat ana, baatana, kayse belona?
Nou finn peple lil ar seve krepi,
Ar kabri Danlenn, lizie boutonnyer.
Malgre ki tousa finn bien melanze
Nou pa pe fouti met lafors ansam
Pou fer rekonet nou istwar komen,
Nou kiltir metis ek nou lang kreol.
Dalenn aat ana, Amorris bahout atcha!
Aat ana, baatana, kayse belona?
Aster nou problem, san fwa pli serye;
Nou gardmanze vid; planet dan dife;
Klima finn gagn kriz; bizen enterdi
Lenerzi fosil; nou lagrikiltir
Bizen sanz vizaz; nou bizen ras kann
Pou plant kanabis ki donn CBD.
Dalenn at ana, Amorris bahout atcha!
Aat ana, baatana, kayse belona?
Apart CBD ki pou ed nou tou
Ki soufer douler PPS, artrit,
Rematis, kanser, depresion, migrenn,
Asma, HIV, douler menopoz …
Kanabis endistriyel donn matier
Lendistri textil, lakord, konstriksion.
Dalenn at ana, Amorris bahout atcha!
Aat ana, baatana, kayse belona?
Biznes farmasi, baron sikriye,
Ar politisien finn marye-pike
Pou defann profi enn minorite.
Ala nou dir zot, nou, mazorite,
Nou pou fann ar zot pou nou dinite,
Pou ki nou zanfan viv pli bien dime.
Dalenn at ana, Amorris bahout atcha!
Aat ana, baatana, kayse belona?

I think that literacy should not be considered as “a thing” or a monolithic block but rather as a process made up of several levels or stages.
• The initial stage could be considered as “BASIC MOTHER TONGUE LITERACY”. In the Maritime Republic of Mauritius, because of the complex language reality, it is advisable to make some adjustments and develop a course in BASIC BILINGUAL LITERACY (basic literacy in the two important creole languages: Mauritian and English for the island of Mauritius and Rodriguan and English for the island of Rodrigues) to be dispensed to our children from grade 1 to grade 9.
• The second stage should aim at FUNCTIONAL TRILINGUAL LITERACY from grade 10 to 13 to develop functional oracy, literacy and numeracy in Mauritian/Rodriguan, English and French. Moreover, an optional ethnic language – (in alphabetical order: Arabic, Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu etc.) – should be offered.
• The third stage should aim at COMPULSORY ADVANCED BILINGUAL LITERACY (in Mauritian/Rodriguan and English) for university students. Opportunities should be available for those who want to specialize in French and any ethnic or non-ethnic language.
Such a language policy will most certainly contribute to general development and the building of a RAINBOW NATION.

THINKING ABOUT IT
THINKING ABOUT IT
TWO ARTICLES
1.  ON LANGUAGE LEARNING
The human brain is equipped with a language acquisition device (LAD). This explains why, naturally and normally, children learn to speak the language of their environment if there has not been any brain damage. If a baby, born in a remote village of Mauritius, is immediately taken to an English-speaking family in Liverpool, that baby will soon become a native speaker of Liverpudlian English. A newborn baby from a housing estate (cité) in urban Mauritius who is taken to a French-speaking family of Marseille will become a native speaker of Marseillais. 90% of babies born in Mauritius become native speakers of Mauritian Creole (MC). It is to be noted that while the babies exported to England and France suffer a small trauma caused by the language change from what was heard in the womb and that of post-delivery, the Mauritian children continue to hear the same language. It is sad that most people do not know that the ear is the first organ to develop and the foetus starts to hear the mother’s voice at a very early stage. This is why the first language is called mother tongue.
If the acquisition of speech – speaking and understanding the mother tongue – is a natural process for the LAD is equipped with what is known as UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR, the story is completely different when it comes to learn to read and write. LAD is found in the Broca’s area but there is no area responsible for reading and writing. How do we then learn to read and write? Professor Stanislas Dehaene explains: https://blog.learnfasthq.com/how-the-brain-learns-to-read-professor-stanislaus-dehaene
From the brain’s point of view, learning to read consists of:
First, recognising the letters and how they combine into written words
Second, connecting them to the brain systems for coding of speech sounds and for meaning.
Reading starts in your brain like any other visual stimulation, in the general visual areas of the occipital pole of the brain, but then very quickly moves into an area which concerns the recognition of the written word.
Professor Dehaene calls this area the brain’s “letter box” because it is where we store our knowledge of letters.
From there it’s an explosion of activity into at least two brain networks; one that concerns the meaning of the words, and another that concerns the pronunciation and the articulation of the words.
When first you went to school to learn to read, your brain already had a very sophisticated spoken language system. It also had a very sophisticated visual system, but it needed to create an interface with the visual word form area, the brain’s letter box.
Reading consists essentially of creating an interface between your vision system in your brain and your language system, your spoken language system…
Everyone’s brain anatomy is changed by learning to read, and Professor Dehaene and his colleagues have managed to make a complete map of the brain areas that have been changed by reading.
The first major change is making the “letter box area” active. It is not active in people who haven’t learnt to read…
FROM L1 TO L2
If learning to read and write your own mother tongue (L1) is very difficult, as shown by Professor Dehaene, although you are already very fluent in it by the time you go to school, imagine the stress and trauma of children who are compelled to ignore their mother tongue and forced to develop reading and writing skills in not ONE but TWO languages they do not speak (L2) i.e.  English and French. How can we do this to our own flesh and blood who need our love, affection and understanding? This is tantamount to cruelty and refusal to help children in danger.
Our cruelty and indifference go deeper due to our refusal to accept the truth and build our system of education on sound principles.
First of all, we do not know what a creole language is. It is a language based on the universal grammar mentioned in paragraph 2 of this article. There are over 100 creole languages in the world. In other words, creole is not a language but a family of languages which have specific characteristics. They are analytic languages as opposed to synthetic languages such as French, Greek, Latin, German, Italian, Russian etc. An analytic language is a language that organizes words and grammar by a strict word order instead of inflections, or word endings that show grammar. English is not only an analytic language. It is also a creole language.
Look at these examples to see the difference between synthetic and analytic languages:
FRENCH: un bel arbre; un beau sport; des beaux tableaux; une belle fleur; des belles filles (5 forms for the same word ‘beau’). ENGLISH: a beautiful tree; a beautiful sport; beautiful paintings; a beautiful flower; beautiful girls (only 1 form for ‘beautiful’). MAURITIAN CREOLE (MORISIEN): enn zoli pie; enn zoli spor; bann zoli tablo; enn zoli fler; bann zoli tifi (as in English, only 1 form for ‘zoli’).
BILINGUAL LITERACY
A rational, coherent and sound education language policy should be based on our national language, Mauritian Creole, and our official language, English. Universal bilingual literacy in MC and English is within our reach. Let us not forget that English is already a quasi-universal language, vital for our development and international relations. More and more countries use it now. It is the most important tool for international communication. Recently President Macron of France did recognise that English is the language most used in Europe and French cannot compete with it. Why? Is it not mainly because synthetic languages (French) are harder to learn than analytic ones (English)? Now look at a simple contrastive analysis and try to do the same with MC and French. Then you will understand why it would be wise to stagger the introduction of French and other L2 languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, etc.).
TENSE&ASPECT IN MC AND ENGLISH
Mo marse/I walk;
Mo pe marse/I am walking;
Mo finn marse/I have walked;
Mo ti marse/I walked;
Mo ti pe marse/I was walking;
Mo ti finn marse/I had walked;
Mo pou marse/I will walk.
These examples show the syntactic similarity between MC and English. Is it not possible to help children acquire basic literacy in these two languages simultaneously? I think it is. I have tried it with children who had failed in literacy and numeracy after 6 years at school (Grade 6). After three years of bilingual literacy and numeracy, they passed the Grade 9 examinations now known as NCE.
TO CONCLUDE
Solutions exist but either we lack the will to change or we do not want change to protect the privileges of a few.
Or the truth may be that we do not really love our children. To know is to love. When we know our children better and know how to make them happy at home and at school, then we can claim that we love them.
Don’t look for scapegoats. We are all to blame if our children are not happy.
The associations of parents and teachers (PTA) should and could lead the way to bring the necessary reform. Teachers should be aware that the change proposed here means that they will have to acquire new knowledge and new teaching methods and that the success of this project means the end of the great business known as MASS PRIVATE TUITIONS as practised today. A school is not a supermarket.
Parents and teachers should know that they cannot have their cake and eat it too. (avoir le beurre et l’argent du buerre/manz banann dan 2 bout).
If we love our children, we should be prepared to make some sacrifice now to ensure a brighter future for them and our country at the same time.
2. DO WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW?
Some of you may not know part of the contents of this letter; many may think that I am repeating myself ad nauseam. But please, bear with me!
In 1967, l’Express was the only newspaper to believe that independent Mauritius would need to develop a supra-ethnic national language and Mauritian Creole (MC) was fit for the job. Prejudices against the language were very strong. All media outlets and the intelligentsia of the time were hostile to any attempt to even consider MC as a language let alone the national language of the-about-to-become an independent country. Malcolm de Chazal called it ‘pete bourik’ (donkey’s fart).
After more than 50 years of uphill fight, the situation is much better now but much more hard work awaits us all. As my sun is now close to the western horizon, TWO issues fill my heart with sadness.
Radio and television presenters seem to think that our national language can be used without any regard or respect for its phonology (right pronunciation), syntax (grammar rules) and lexis (appropriate vocabulary). A radio presenter even told me that he was against the standardisation of our language for he believed in his absolute freedom. A simple question: Can we speak French, Hindi or English any way we want and ignore rules of pronunciation, grammar and right choice of words? Can we say ‘I am sinking’ when we mean ‘I am thinking’?
Most radio and television presenters are guilty of dereliction of duty by ignoring their responsibility to use our language appropriately. Instead, they prefer to ‘Frenchify’ MC and by so doing, they perpetuate prejudices against the mother tongue of 90% of the population and the second language of the remaining 10%. Heads of stations should look into this and insist on the right use of MC by their presenters. They are duty bound to do this.
Most people believe in the official figures regarding the literacy rate of the Republic. In fact, the official figures are misleading because they deliberately confuse literacy with schooling. Children do go to school which is free BUT do they become literate? Literacy is best defined as the ability to write a few grammatically and lexically correct sentences, in any language of your choice, which are well connected and which use appropriate spelling and punctuation to say ‘who you are’. Perhaps only one-third of the population can do this and I think I am optimistic. Roughly speaking, if we start with, say, 25,000 children taking the end of primary school examinations, 5-6 years later about 12,000 will pass S.C and 2-3 years later about 6,000 will have their H.S.C. Success rate? About 25%.
Why is that so? WRONG LANGUAGE POLICY! The human brain is equipped and programmed to learn speech (Broca’s area) and this is why 99.9% of babies develop speech skills round about the age of 1-2. But there is no ‘area’ responsible for the acquisition of reading and writing. Learners have to build a bridge between their Broca’s area and their visual faculty and this is not an easy task. Learning to read and write one’s mother tongue is quite difficult. Now imagine the difficulties of 90% of our children whose mother tongue is ignored and who are forced to acquire reading-writing skills in not ONE, not TWO, but THREE foreign languages. A RECIPE FOR DISASTER!
Literacy is perceived as the privilege of a few when it should be a fundamental right which enables citizens to benefit fully from the benefits of modern living.
I shall never forget the reaction of a senior lecturer in a prestigious institution who objected to a ‘universal literacy project’ in these terms: “Si tou dimoun konn lir-ekrir, kisannla pou koup kann?” (If everybody becomes literate, who will work in the fields.)

MIND YOUR LANGUAGE/KOZ PAROL
People seem to love strange words without caring for meaning. I often hear them say that Mauritian Creole (MC) is a dialect, not a language. Would they care to know that a dialect is a language which is spoken in a specific region within a country – a regional variety of a given language? Do they mean that MC is a dialect of French? If so, it simply means that their knowledge of French is very close to zero for they are not aware that from a phonological and syntactic point of view MC and French are poles apart although French has influenced the lexical development of MC.
Another word which is used very loosely is patois. It is considered as a debased or corrupt form of a standard language. Hence MC is considered as a patois of French. The best definition of patois was given to us by Dr. Peter Stein, a German linguist. A patois is a language spoken by a minority within a given country and the speakers of this language have to resort to another language if they want to be understood by the majority. People whose mother tongue (L1) is French (less than 4% of the population) normally use MC to communicate with people outside their milieu/immediate environment. In this context French is a patois, not MC which is the L1 of 90% of the population and the L2 (second language) of the remaining 10%. Hence used by 100% of the population.
ORIGIN OF MC
• Racists think that MC was born because slaves were unable to learn French because of their thick lips and flat noses. Their imitation of their master’s speech resulted in a crude approximation and general language corruption.
• A more sophisticated approach is known as the ‘substratum’ theory. According to that viewpoint, slaves used as a base their own language on which they pasted French words. This theory does not hold water for we know that the slaves came from different language communities in Africa and yet there is a uniformised MC syntax.
• The Nautical Lingua Franca hypothesis seems more acceptable now. The development of navigation in the Mediterranean Basin attracted mariners from different parts of Europe and on board different ships there were mariners from different language communities and nationalities. This led to the rise and development of a lingua franca used by mariners, colonists and slaves. In the different colonies and plantation economies, the nautical lingua franca underwent a process of relexification – the syntax remained more or less the same but there was a vocabulary change. MC adopted and adapted words of French origin (lexifier language). In Jamaica, English became the lexifier language. This also explains why Haitian Creole and MC are syntactically so close.
THE WHOLE TRUTH
There are more than 100 creole languages in the world. Some of them developed in colonies which thrived on slave labour but not all. Sango, Afrikaans or English are creole languages which did not develop in plantation economies or under slavery. Note that Afrikaans is one of the national languages of the Republic of South Africa; Sango is both the national and official (together with French) language of the Central African Republic; English has become the quasi-universal language of planet Earth.
It is now believed that when a community is made up of people speaking different languages not mutually intelligible, a new speech emerges based on language universals with which our DNA is programmed. Initially, it is simple with a few basic rules (tense, aspect, singular/plural, gender etc.) and a very limited vocabulary. This stage is known as ‘pidgin’. It is nobody’s mother tongue. With time, children are born whose L1 is the new language. With the passage of time, the phonology and syntax become standardised and the lexis becomes more robust and sophisticated. This is the second stage known as ‘creole’. In due course, the language is identified with a people or country and a name change may take place. Because MC is a very advanced and sophisticated creole, the L1 of 90% of the Mauritian population and the L2 of the remaining 10%, it is legitimate to consider calling it Mauritian, the national language of Mauritius.

DO WE REALLY KNOW?
FOR LOGA ON MOTHERS’ DAY
I have friends who are categorical: “God is dead.”
My friends who believe in God can be divided into three groups.
In the first group, I find those who think He is formless and almighty. He is the CREATOR who dishes out rewards and punishments.
In the second group there is the belief that He is LOVE and MERCY. Although He is almighty, He has an army of saints and angels to look after His CREATION.
The third group, to which I belong, believes in a SUPREME BEING who is everything and is everywhere. He is neither He nor She. He/She is “THEY”, both Shaktiman and Shakti. They are “LI” (which in Mauritian is both masculine and feminine). Because the faith is based on freedom and poetic imagination, many forms have been imagined to represent the masculine-feminine-plural SUPREME BEING. This open, all-encompassing conception of God has been misunderstood by most Judeo-Christians as POLYTHEISM.
God ARE all shades of skin colour; all material and immaterial shapes in the universe. They are present in ALL beings and things. They have made us part of nature and consequently we are duty-bound to look after nature as guardians and stewards. Nature cannot be the private property of a few greedy and selfish individuals.
God ARE ‘all Mothers-Fathers’ who give lifeblood to the whole universe.
To grasp well the full nature of Mother-Father-CREATOR, human language must be reformed and syntax changed. The division of noun-reality into masculine, feminine, singular and plural may be a good grammatical tool to help us define our world but is vastly inadequate to understand fully the nature and attributes of Mother-Father-CREATOR who ARE genderless and plural.
Simplification may be a good initial pedagogical tool but oversimplification can be a dangerous road to general confusion and blindness. Overemphasis on rituals and superficial explanations definitely makes matters worse as believers just skim the surface and essentials deep under are ignored. This gives them a false sense of security and comfort.
Can our notion of the divine influence our thoughts and daily practice and impact on the way we organise life and society?
• Can our perception of “GOD” as blue-eyed, blond-haired and white-skinned generate racist reflexes detrimental to harmony and justice?
• Can our perception of “GOD” as bearded, as “He/Our Father/Papa dan lesiel” generate sexist reflexes detrimental to gender equality?
• Can the perception of “GOD” as the Almighty Judge, King of Heaven, dishing out rewards and punishments, condition us to condone dictatorship and accept theocratic rule to the detriment of human rights and democracy?
• Can the perception of “GOD” as EVERYTHING EVERPRESENT help us develop an eco-friendly mindset and turn us away from our present predator mentality?
Since doubt is the beginning of wisdom, let us start questioning our conviction not to weaken it but to strengthen it by taking the hard road to knowledge and self-knowledge.
Can we be complacent and think like most Mauritians that we know all that is to be known and have no shortcomings we should be ashamed of?
Do we really know who we are? Do we know our place in the universe? Are we aware of all our duties and responsibilities to our environment, the human race and our Mother-Father-CREATOR?

FREEDOM IS NOT LICENCE
There are some people who think that freedom means the right to say and do whatever you like. In fact, they confuse ‘freedom’ with ‘licence’.
When you live in society, freedom is always ‘qualified’ and not ‘absolute’ because your freedom stops where mine begins.
But freedom is not a static concept. From feudalism to the present time, the world has known great changes in terms of freedom and fundamental rights. The struggle for new freedoms is a continuous process. As we move forward, new responsibilities become necessary. However, there are still the few hotheads who prefer to ignore that freedom and rights are meaningless without clear thinking, responsibilities and duties.
POLITICS AND POLITICKING
The exercise of freedom has to take place within a legal framework which will undergo changes as society progresses.
The action of a serious political party is based on a clear ideology, programme and objective. The Mauritius Labour Party (MLP) was inspired by Fabian Socialism; the PMSD started as a pro-capitalist, pro-apartheid and anti-Hindu party and much later was forced to sober down and adopt a less ultra-right policy; the MMM started as a modern socialist party and the MSM opted for pragmatism which inevitably drove it into the grip of neoliberalism (rightwing capitalism).
As a result of MSM’s electoral success, its opponents, be it MLP or MMM, were swallowed by ravenous neoliberalism and today all main parties dance to the same neoliberal tune. This is why (a) MLP and MMM members and followers can easily change allegiance and join the politically cunning MSM and (b) politicking has replaced political debates. Consequently, mudslinging, rumours, lies and slander ‘have sovereign sway and masterdom’. The ground is now ripe for demagogues, rascals and adventurists to fool people who love rumours and gossips. Should they not enjoy the freedom to cast aspersions and use technology to spread lies, half-truths and unverified information?
MISUSE OF TECHNOLOGY
Social media which have a great potential to inform, educate and entertain may be misused by half-baked intellectuals (and I am polite) and unscrupulous people who have no regards for basic moral principles as long as they can satisfy their selfish motives, aims and objectives. These media give us a lot of freedom but also opens the door to rumours, lies, unverified information, narcissism, propaganda and libel. Social media are used as an extension tool for the good old gossiping culture. Every moron sees himself as a competent journalist who should enjoy unrestricted freedom.
Computer scientists and philosophers are worried by the way some people use digital technology. Is any form of control possible? Will licence finally take full control over our lives? Time will tell.

Pou ranz zoli laplaz pou bronzaz
Bann kliyan dideor depasaz.

FORMATION UNIVERSITAIRE À DISTANCE
Fort du nouveau souffle procuré par Kleopas, l’ICJM opère désormais, comme le Service Diocésain de la Formation des formateurs et, à cet effet, nous avons signé un Protocole d’Accord avec Domuni Universitas, en lien avec les Dominicains qui ont une très longue tradition de 800 ans d’enseignement universitaire, en vue d’offrir des cours à distance à des éventuels étudiants en théologie, philosophie, etc. ; ceci permettrait d’utiliser l’outil informatique à bon escient, au service de l’approfondissement et du murissement de la foi chrétienne.
De ce fait, l’ICJM pourra désormais être le point focal de Domuni au sein de notre Diocèse de sorte qu’une fois enregistrés pour suivre des cours en ligne par le biais de l’ICJM, les étudiants locaux ainsi inscrits à Domuni puissent bénéficier d’un tutorat avec l’ICJM pour mener à bien leurs études à distance.
Trois types de formations sont proposés par Domuni : des diplômes européens Licence (3 ans)-Masters (5 ans)-Doctorat ou reconnus par Rome, des formations courtes (2 certificats et 14 brevets) et des modules (cours à la carte). De plus amples renseignements peuvent être obtenus sur le site web suivant : http://www.domuni.eu/fr/universite/presentation. Vous trouverez également en annexe un dépliant présentant Domuni.

DAN PLIS GAGN MWENS
Plis li gagne, plis li rode;
Plen tenk me zame satisfe.
Plis li ena, plis li ole;
So bezwen zame rasazie.
So prop lang li pa konn ekrir
Me li prefer lang etranzer
Ki dapre li boukou pli pir
Malgre lalang pe touy gramer.
Li gagn nisa dan kantite
Ki kapav konte-ramase;
Kalite pa konn tini kont.
Plis li gagne, mwens li ere;
Li pa kapav kominike,
Ni kapav get ler dan so mont.
AR MWENS FER PLIS
Mwens li kone, plis deklare;
Mwens li aprann, plis li kone;
Mwens li tande, plis li koze;
Mwens li konpran, plis li zaze.
Plis pa kone, plis li vantar;
Plis pa kone, plis li razwar;
Plis pa kone, plis li tazar;
Plis pa kone, plis li nanar.

Samem kiltir pei Moris:
Dan plis gagn mwens, ar mwens fer plis.

CHOOOUUU! ZOT PA POU GAGN MWA!
CHOOOUUU! ZOT PA POU GAGN MWA/CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!
                              1
Dan lekol Goudlenns, enn ti kreolinn
Ti pe sikann mwa parski mo malbar
Ki pa konn Kreol, zis konn fer mofinn.
Dan Goudlenns, boukou banane pli tar,
Mo ti zwenn Mis Mod ar seve drese
Ki ti kritik mwa parski dapre li
Mo ti pe anpes bann zanfan Kreol
Konn Angle-Franse pou kit site tol,
Gagn enn bon travay dan ti paradi.
Zot ti kontan sikane:
Dir mwa ki mo enn payen;
Zangarna pa vo nanye.
Eski zot anvi kone
Ki Zezi, sen tou bann sen,
Li enn avatar Bondie?
In the village of my youth, a young kinky haired Creole girl mocked me for my coolie Creole was shocking. Years later I met her again. She was a straightened haired school teacher who reprimanded me for promoting Creole to the detriment of English and French, a passport to a good job and a better life. They think I am a pagan, child of Juggernaut. Do they know Jesus is my Lord God?
                                      2
Dan Bobasen mo ti gagn sikane
Parski mo ti pe apel mo granper
“Tata”, mo Telegou pou granpapa.
“So granper tata, li mari tata!”
Dan lekol lefrer, dan kolez lefrer
Ti fer mwa konpran pa ena dime
Pou zans bitasion. Mo plas pa lot ki
Dan dife lanfer parski paradi
Li rezerve pou bann ki swiv Zezi.
Zot ti kontan sikane:
Dir mwa ki mo enn payen;
Zangarna pa vo nanye.
Eski zot anvi kone
Ki Zezi, sen tou bann sen,
Li enn avatar Bondie?
The town I grew up in, mocked me because I called my grandad “Tata” (‘tata’ is a Creole word considered a less harsh word for ‘kaka’ – shit), a Telugu word for grandfather. If my grandad was shit, I was supershit. In a Christian college, I was told that people like me would definitely end in the fires of hell. They think I am a pagan, child of Juggernaut. Do they know Jesus is my Lord God?
                                3
Lor later kreol, aster ki nou rol?
Bann Afrokreol, bann Erokreol
Prefer koz Franse pou gagn gabari
E fer lil kreol vinn enn Ti-Pari;
Bann Endokreol pe rod fer pei
Vinn chota Barrat; Islamokreol
Fer kwar ki zot tou sorti Larabi.
Personn pa’le kwar, lor later kreol,
Nou tou koz kreol, manz ek viv kreol.
Zot ti kontan sikane:
Dir mwa ki mo enn payen;
Zangarna pa vo nanye.
Eski zot anvi kone
Ki Zezi, sen tou bann sen,
Li enn avatar Bondie?
On my Creole Island, both Afro and Euro creoles think French is their lifebuoy and they dream of Little France; Indo creoles want our land to become Little India; Islamo creoles want to believe that they came from Arabia. Why is it hard to accept that we are all immigrants who speak creole languages, eat creole food and live by creole standards, another term for miscegenation. They think I am a pagan, child of Juggernaut. Do they know Jesus is my Lord God?

KIFER NOU PER?
Ki li patriyark, ki li matriyark,
Toulede bien per minorite ge.
To kone kifer? Parski tou bann ge,
Ki li zom ou fam, zot pe montre nou
Pa ena zis de jennder parmi nou.
Si trwaziem jennder vinn mazorite,
Falo-vazino vinn minorite,
Ki pou’ariv patriyark ek matriyark?
Zot rod fer nou per. Ekout liv sakre:
“Bizen ogmante ek miltipliye.”
Anal ek oral pa enn bon zafer;
Li pa natirel! Pou al dan lanfer!
Lergete zot per perdi zot pouvwar;
Zot per ki dime enn lot trap labar.

MIND YOUR LANGUAGE 3
MIND YOUR LANGUAGE 3
(ON THE WORD PATOIS)
“Patois is speech or language that is considered nonstandard, although the term is not formally defined in linguistics. As such, patois can refer to pidgins, creoles, dialects or vernaculars …
In colloquial usage of the term, especially in France, class distinctions are implied by the very meaning of the term, since in French, patois refers to any sociolect associated with uneducated rural classes, in contrast with the dominant prestige language (Standard French) spoken by the middle and high classes of cities or as used in literature and formal settings (the “acrolect”).” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patois)
CARACTERISTICS OF A PATOIS
• It is spoken by a minority;
• It is not standardised;
• It has no prestige;
• It is used orally only;
• It is considered to be a corrupt form of some prestigious language;
• It is not used in literature;
• It is very often considered as part of a country’s folklore.
IS MAURITIAN A PATOIS?
It cannot be. WHY?
• It is the mother tongue, the first language (L1) of 90% of the population of Mauritius and the second language (L2) of the remaining 10% whose L1 is Bhojpuri (5%) and French (3.8%). It is used by 100% of the population;
• It is used informally in administration;
• It is used in churches, mosques and temples;
• It is taught in schools;
• It is a powerful medium of literary creation;
• It is used by electronic media etc.
It belongs to a family of languages known as Creole and in that group, there are about 100 languages among which we find Afrikaans (one of the national languages of South Africa), Sango (the national and official language of the Central African Republic), Tok Pisin (the official language of Papua New Guinea) and English which, according to scholars, developed as a result of the invasion of England by Vikings 1200 years ago.
WHO CALL IT PATOIS?
Most people call the language of Mauritius ‘Kreol’; some have started to call it ‘Morisien’ but a handful insist on calling it patois. Who are they? They are a few mentally retarded Euro-creoles who still think Mauritius is ‘La Petite France’. For them Morisien is ‘pete bourik’ (dixit Malcolm de Chazal); it is the object of sarcasm, contempt and ridicule; it’s good only for swearing, rudeness and crude jokes …

FINN LER POU PIE FLER DONN FLER
Atmaram dan so zarden
Gout douser transpirasion
Dan semans, transplantasion;
Dan so gref ek so proven.
So bann pie pa fer erer.
Pie mang, vavang, frisiter,
Bilenbi, bibas, mason
Garni ar fri lasezon.
Me so pie fler prefere
Ti plen so nam ar egrer:
Li ti refiz donn so fler.
Enn swar vieyi, fatige
Li ti tom anba so pie
Ki ti aroz li ar fler.

OPEN LETTER TO PM
Date: 17.01.23
OPEN LETTER TO THE HONOURABLE PRIME MINISTER
Dear Prime Minister,
Please consider the humble request of a citizen facing the ailments of old age and the torturing pains of Post-Polio Syndrome.
Over a period of more than 50 years, I have written thousands of poems, dozens of plays, hundreds of literary and non-literary prose pieces in our national language. Moreover, I have translated into our language some world classics – Shakespeare, Molière, Blake, Keats etc. – and much prized religious literature – books from The Old Testament, the New Testament; pages from The Holy Koran; The Bhagavad Gita; The Upanishads.
My main mission in life has been and is the promotion and development of a supra-ethnic language, the foundation stone of a national culture.
All my works can be freely accessed on https://boukiebanane.com hosted and supported by Tewin Sham, CEO & Co-Founder, Icy Evolution Web Hosting.
I have already bequeathed my exclusive property rights [©] to Institut Cardinal Jean Margeot (ICJM), Maison de Carné, 1, Celicourt Antelme street, Rose Hill, 71360, Mauritius, to support the institution’s education and intercultural mission.
Moreover, my friend Dhiren Moonesamy (dhiren.moonesamy@gmail.com ; +230 5719 2309) has kindly accepted to be the guardian of my works to ensure that their integrity and perenniality are secured and fostered.
Creative writings enter the public domain (no exclusive property rights) 70 years after the death of the author. However, my wish is to get all my writings to enter the public domain immediately. In my humble opinion this can be done if the state buys the property rights and then hand them over to the world.
As I have already given my rights to ICJM, I suggest that the state of Mauritius and ICJM agree on a deal to be decided by them. They will have my full support. All proceeds will go to ICJM.
Moreover, the state, through the National Library, will have to negotiate with Icy Evolution Web Hosting for the transfer of all materials from https://boukiebanane.com to the National Library website.
As I am almost at the end of my tether, I would much appreciate it if you could treat this as urgent.
Brotherly namaste,
Dev Virahsawmy
(aka Narendraj Virah Sawmy; I.D V1603423201016)

(Matsya – fish (Paleozoic era); Kurma – amphibious tortoise (Mesozoic era); Varaha – boar (Cenozoic era); Narasimha – man-lion, the last animal and semi-human avatar (Cenozoic era); Vamana – growing dwarf and first step towards the human form; Parasurama – a hero, but imperfect human form; Rama – another hero, physically perfect, befriends a speaking vanara deity Hanuman; Krishna – son of Devaki; Buddha – the founder of Buddhism; Kalki – yet to happen and the savior, and is like Christian Advent.)

Plis ki trwa mil an desela
Bann rishi Endien ti gagn entwision

Dousma-dousma ti vinn peple later
E evolision ti fer nou.
Kreasion amenn destriksion;
Lerla destriksion amenn kreasion
Ki repran sime destriksion.
Rishi Endien koz kali youg;
Siyantis modern anons ‘The Big Crunch’
Ki pou donn nesans nouvo youg.
Pa kwar li blasfem ler mo dir
Ki avan Kalki, ena Zezikri
Ki finn prepar nou pou lafen.
Bizen ki ansam nou ouver lespri
Pou prepar sime ver nouvo desten.
Lafen enn pou amenn nesans enn lot.
O Bondie Lekor-Lespri-Nam
Tomem kreater liniver
Fer to lalimier gid nou tou
Ekler nou lespri ki dan nwar

(Mersi PROJECT GUTENBERG)
tex sours: Indian fairy tales, selected and edited by Joseph Jacobs
TRADIKSION-ADAPTASION PAR DEV VIRAHSAWMY
ZISTWAR LION EK MARTEN
(The Lion and the Crane)
Bodisata (Buddha) ti enn fwa pran nesans kouma enn Marten bien nwar dan rezion Samarel. Sa lepok la Bramadata ti lerwa Moris.
Dan Montagn Samarel ti ena enn lion. Ler li ti pe manze, enn lezo ti tas dan so lagorz. So lagorz ti anfle e li nepli ti kapav manze. Li ti dan soufrans terib. Marten ki ti pe rod manze lor pie, ti trouv li e ti dimann li, “Ki ou problem, dalon?” Lion la ti explik li so problem. Lerla Marten la ti dir li,”Fasil, mo kapav ed ou me mo per ki ler mo rant dan ou labous, ou manz mwa.” Lion la ti reponn, “Mo promet, mo fer serman ki mo pa pou manz ou. Sov mo lavi, pliz!”
Marten ti dir lion la alonze lor so flan gos e kouma li pa ti fer li konfians, li ti met enn baton anvertikal dan labous lion la, tansion li fer marday. Koumsa li ti sir ki lion la pa ti pou kapav ferm so labous. Marten ti rant dan labous lion, tir lezo la e ler li ti pe sorti depi labous lion, li ti tap enn kout bek pou fer baton la tonbe e li ti anvole al dibout lor enn brans.
Lion la ti geri. Enn zour ler lion la ti pe manz enn mouton, Marten ti desid pou teste li. Depi so brans, li ti koz ar li.
“Mo ti rann ou enn gran servis;
Pa ti rod bout ousa baksis.
Aster dir mwa, O Mazeste!
Ki ou pou fer kouma bienfe.”
Lion la ti reponn:
“Mwa mo bizen laviann seyan;
Mo touye pou mo res vivan.
Dir mersi to ankor vivan,
Twa ki ti la ant mo ledan.”
Marten pa ti kil parad:
“Engratitid, samem ou nom!
Kan ou finn gagn benediksion
Pa reponn ar malediksion.
Li kler ou pa enn lerwa bon.
Li pa konpran vre lamitie;
Li konpran zis bate-rande.
Meyer ar li nou bat karte
San rankinn, san ostilite.
Apre sa, Marten ti anvole, ale.
Kan Gourou Gawtama Bouda rakont sa zistwar la, li ti abitie dir ki lion tret se Devadata e Marten se li, Buddha.
ALA KIMANNYER GARSON LERWA TI GAGN LAMOUR PRENSES LABAM
(How the Raja’s Son won the Princess Labam.)
Dan enn ti lil dan Losean Endien, ti ena enn lerwa ki ti ena ennsel garson. Li ti kontan lasas. Enn zour Larenn (so mama) ti dir li, “Beta, to kapav lasas dan lenor, dan les ek dan lwes me fodepa al lasas dan lesid”. Mama la ti kone ki si li al dan lesid li ti pou tann rimer lor Prenses Labam, enn bote rar, e lerla li ti pou kit mama-papa pou rod laprenses.
Prens ti bien ekout so mama e ti rapel so konsey. Me enn zour so kiryozite ti depas larezon. Li ti desid pou al gete kifer so mama ti defann li al lasas dan lesid. Kan li ti ariv dan lesid, enn gran lazeng ti antour li. Dan lazeng la ti ena peroke par ta. Nou zenn Prens ti tir detrwa kout bal e enn sel kou zot tou ti fonn dan lesiel. Me enn gran gayar ti res anplas. So nom ti Hiramann; limem ti lerwa peroke.
Ler li ti get tou so larme sove, li ti kriye for pou zot tande, “Zot sove e les mwa tousel kan garson lerwa pe tir lor nou. Si zot abandonn mwa koumsa mo pou raport zot ar Prenses Labam.”
Kouma enn fles zot tou retourne dan enn gran tapaz lavwa. Prens la ti soke. “Kisasa! Zwazo konn koze?” Prens la ti dimann bann peroke lenformasion lor Prenses Labam: Kisannla sa? Kot li reste?
Bann peroke la ti zis dir li, “Zame to pou kapav rant dan pei Prenses Labam.”
Enn latristes ti pran Prens la parski peroke ti pe refiz donn li lenformasion ki li ti bizen. Li ti zet so fizi e ti pran sime lakaz. Kot li, li ti refi koze, refiz manze. Pandan 4-5 zour li ti res lor lili. Li ti paret bien fay.
Alafen li ti koze. Li ti dimann so papa ek so mama kot pei Prenses Labam ete. “Mo bizen get li. Kestion lavi-lamor.”
“Nou pa kone, beta,” toulede ti reponn anmemtan.
“Mo pou al rod li,” li ti dir zot.
“Pa fer sa, beta. To nou sel zanfan. Nou bizen twa. Perttan! Personn pa finn trouv li.”
“Mo pa pou kile! Mo pou rod li ziska mo mor. Kikfwa Bonje pou ed mwa. Si mo zwenn li, mo pou retourn lakaz ar li. Si mo pa zwenn li, zot pa pou retrouv mwa. Konpran mwa ‘ma! Konpran mwa ‘pa!”
Akontreker zot les li ale. So papa ti donn li boukou larzan, zoli lenz ek so seval prefere. Prens ti pran tou so bann zarm. “Kikfwa pou bizen zot.”
Li ti prepar so seval pou enn long vwayaz. Li ti anbras so paran. So mama ti donn li enn mouswar ranpli ar mitay. “Ti mitay pou ed twa pandan to long vwayaz.”
Li ti al direk dan lazeng kot ti ena enn basen antoure ar touf pie.Li ti pran enn ben e ti bengn so seval. Apresa li ti kas enn poz anba enn pie, ouver mouswar so mama, pran enn mitay. Ti ena enn fourmi ladan. Li ti poz li anba, pran enn lot e dan deziem la ‘si ti ena enn fourmi. Li ti poz li anba akote premie la. Me li ti dekouver ki dan tou bann mitay ti ena fourmi. Li ti poz tou anba pou les fourmi amize.
Lerlamem Lerwa Fourmi paret divan li pou remersie li. “Ou finn fer zwer ar nou. Nenport kan ou bizen led, nek pans nou e nou tou pou vinn donn ou enn koudme.”
Prens ti remersie zot e san perdi letan ti mont lor so seval e fer li galoupe ziska li ti ariv dan enn lot lazeng kot li ti zwenn ar enn tig ki ti pe kriye for-for ar douler. Ti ena enn pikan dan so lapat.
Prens ti dimann li kifer li pe plengne koumsa.
“Mo ena enn pikan dan mo lapat depi 12 banane e douler la pe vinn deplizanpli for. Pa kapav tini.”
Prens ti dir li ki li ti pou kapav tir pikan la me ena enn problem. “Ler mo fini tir pikan la ou pou sot lor mwa, devor mwa.”
“Pa per, mo pa pou manz ou.”
Prens la ti servi so kanif pou tir pikan la. Operasion la ti pe fer Tig gagn plis dimal. So douler ti fer li kriye dis fwa pli for. Tig so partner ki ti res dan enn lot lazeng akote, ti rekonet lavwa so amoure e san perdi letan li ti fons dan direksion lavwa la. Tig ki ti trouv li pe vini, ti kasiet Prens pou protez li.
“Kot sa verminn ki ti pe tortir twa?”
“Pa verminn, me garson Lerwa ki ti pe tir enn pikan ki ti tas dan mo lipie.”
“Kot li? Amenn li isi.”
“Si to fer serman ki to pa pou fer li ditor.”
“Mo promet mo pa pou atak li. Mo’le konn li.”
Lerla Tig ti apel Prens. Ler li ti divan zot, zot ti salie li kouma dwatet, ti donn li foul ospitalite pandan 3 zour. Prens ti okip lapat tig la ziska li ti geri net. Ler li ti pe dir zot orevwar, zot ti asir li ki nenport ki moman li ti pou bizen zot, li nek ti bizen pans zot e zot ti pou lor baz.
Prens ti kontinie so vwayaz ziska li ti zwenn enn trwaziem lazeng. Laba, li ti zwenn 4 fakir ki ti finn perdi zot gourou ki ti les deryer li 4 obze: enn lili ki ti kapav amenn nenport kisannla ki ti asiz lor li, nenport ki kote li ti anvi ale; enn sak ki ti kapav donn so propriyeter nenport ki zafer li ti bizen – bizou, manze, lenz; enn bol anpier ki ti kapav donn so propriyeter kantite dilo ki li ti bizen mem si li ti bien lwen ar basen ou lasours; ek enn baton ar so lakord ki ti donn pouvwar so propriyeter fer fas nenport ki adverser lor vites, bat zot e atas zot.
4 fakir la ti pe diskite-dispite pou kone kisannla pou pran ki zafer: “Pou mwa sa.’ “Non, pou mwa.” “Bliye, li ti donn mwa sa.” “Manti, li ti donn mwa.” Koze pou labous pa pi!
Prens dir zot aret zot makanbo. “Get sa, mo pou avoy 4 fles dan 4 direksion. Seki gagn premie fles pou pran lili la; seki gagn deziem fles pou gagn sak la; seki gagn trwaziem fles pran bol anpier e seki gagn katriyem fles, otomatikman pou pran baton ar lakord.” Zot ti tom dakor. Prens ti lans so premie fles. 4 fakir la ti galoupe pou al rod li. Ler zot ti retourne ar fles la, li ti lans deziem e pli tar trwaziem. Ler zot ti retourne ar trwaziem, Prens ti lans katriyem. Pa bizen dir bann fakir ti demare ankatriyem vites. Prens ti profite pou larg so seval e li ti al asiz lor lili antoure ar bol, sak ek baton ar lakord. Li ti dimann lili amenn li dan pei Prenses Labam. Koze ki long! Li ti dan pei Prenses la. Prens ti dimann detrwa dimoun ki ti pe pase, “Ki pei sa?” Zot ti reponn ki sa ti pei Prenses Labam. Prens ti desid pou explor landrwa la. Li ti ariv kot enn lakaz kot ti ena enn vie bonnfam.
“Ou ki ou?”, Bonnfam la ti dimande. “Kot ou sorti?”
Prens ti reponn, “Mo sorti bien-bien lwen. Eski mo kapav res kot ou zis pou enn nwit?”
“Peyna sime!”, Bonnfam la ti reponn. Nou lerwa finn donn lord ki falepa les enn zom etranze res dan nou pei. Mo bien sagren, ou pa kapav res kot mwa.”
“Ou kouma mo tantinn. Ed mwa. Labrim pe leve. Deor, zanimo feros pe rod manze. Ena danze deor. Les mo res zis enn nwit kot ou. Boner dime gramaten mo pou fonn. Pliz!”
“Bon, zis enn nwit. Boner gramaten, fonndos. Mo pe pran risk. Si Lerwa aprann ki ou finn pas lanwit dan mo lakaz, dife lor mwa.”
Li ti fer li rant dan so lakaz. Prens la ti soulaze. Bonnfam ti koumans prepar manze,
“Chombo!” Prens ti dir. “Tantinn, mwa ki pou prepar manze. Nek gete!” Li ti met so lame dan sak e li ti dir, “Sak, Sak, prepar sefann pou de”. San atann, latabamanze ti garni ar manze rwayal lor pla rwayal.
Apre dine, Bonnfam ti dir, “Beta, mo al sers enpe dilo pou lakaz. Barik, gamel ek damzann vid.” Prens ti dir li pa pran traka. Li ti pran bol e li ti dir, “Plen partou!” Bonnfam ti gagn sok. Zame li ti finn trouv otan dilo. Mem brok dan so lasam ti plen.
Kouma ti koumans fer nwar, Prens ti dimann enn lalanp.
“Kifer ou dimann sa? Atann enn timama, ou pou trouve. Dan pei Prenses Labam, lalanp pa neseser. Kan marenwar net partou, Prenses Labam pou al asiz lor top sato e li pou koumans briye e so lalimier pou rant partou.”
Kan ti finn fer nwar net, Prenses Labam, ti leve, ti met so rob kouler soley, so bizou kouler zetwal, ti lev so seve e ti fer enn poutou lor so latet e otour poutou la li ti plas enn kouronn jaman ek perl. Enn kout mazik, partou ti eklere e li ti fer lanwit vinn lizour. Lerla li ti al asiz lor top sato. Kan fer lizour, zame li pa ti sorti andeor so lasam. Zis aswar. Lerla tou dimoun dan pei ti karionn ar zot travay ek obligasion.
Prens ti emerveye, ti kontanple bote Prenses la. “Ala li zoli la!”
Zis minwi, kan tou dimoun ti kaysou, Prenses la ti desann depi twatir pale e ti al dan so lasam. San perdi letan, Prens ti leve san fer tapaz, ti al lor so lili mazik e ti dir, “Lili, mo bon lili, amenn mwa dan lasam Prenses Labam.”
Enn segonn apre li ti dan lasam Prenses la.
Lerla Prenses la ti dimann so sak enn bon kantite fey betel. Kouma fey betel anta paret, Prens la ti met zot otour lili Prenses la. Apre li ti mont lor so lili , li ti retourn kot Bonnfam.
Lelandime gramaten bann servant ti trouv bann fey betel ki zot ti koumans manze san perdi letan.
Ler Prenses ti trouv zot pe antonn fey betel, li ti dimann zot kot zot ti gagn tousa.
“Kot ou lili, Vot Altes!”
Anmemtan, Bonnfam al kot lili Prens la pou dir li ki li ti bizen ale lor vites. Sinon ti pou ena bigtreboul dan so douniya!
“Tantinn, mo tantinn, mo pa bien. Les mo res ankor enn zour. Apre mo pou ale.”
Li ti res ankor enn zour. Bonnfam la pa ti mayn ditou parski Prens ti pe okip tou: manze, dilo ek netwayaz lakaz ek lakour.
Lelandime, tou ti pas kouma lavey. Prenses ti leve e ti al asiz lor twatir sato ziska minwi e lerla li ti retourn dan sa lasam. Kan tou dimoun ti pe dormi, parey kouma lavey, Prens ti retourn dan lasam Prenses ar enn shal splandid ki sak ti donn li. Li ti poz shal la lor Prenses e li ti retourn kot Bonnfam.
Ler soley ti leve, Prenses la ti gagn enn sok agreab. Li ti dir so mama, “Maa, get ki mo finn gagne? Mo kwar ki Providans, pa lot, ki finn donn mwa sa. Li tro zoli.” So mama ti bien kontan. Li ti dakor ki zis Providans ti kapav donn enn kado koumsa.
Ankor enn fwa, Bonnfam ti dir Prens ki li ti bizen ale me lom la ti sipliy li, dir li les li res detrwa zour ankor. “Mo pou res kasiet pou ki personn pa trouv mwa.” Bonnfam ti les so leker koze e li ti aksepte.
Lanwit ki ti swiv, Prens ti retourn dan lasam Prenses la ar enn zoli bag jaman. Me ler li ti pe pas li dan ledwa Prenses, tifi lerwa so somey ti kase e li ti soke pou trouv enn zom dan so lasam.
“Kisannla ou? Ki ou pe fer dan mo lasam?”
“Pa per Vot Altes! Mo pa enn vwayou. Mwa mo garson enn gran lerwa. Peroke Hiramann ki viv dan enn lazeng kot mo ti pe lasas ti dir mwa ki ou ete. Mo finn kit tou deryer mwa, papa, mama, rwayom, zis pou vinn get ou.”
Parski ou zanfan enn gran lerwa, mo pa pou fer touy ou me mo pou dir mo mama ek mo papa ki se ar ou ki mo pou marye.”
Prens ti retourn kot Bonnfam. Prenses ti al rakont tou so mama ki ti al koz ar lerwa.
“Bon!”, lerwa ti dir. “Si sa prens la ole marye ar mo tifi, li bizen fer tou seki mo dir. Si li fane, lamor so plas. Mo pou donn li 80 liv lagren moutard e li pou bizen tir so dilwil dan enn zour. Si li fel, li kaykoun.”
Ler gramaten vini, Prens ti al koz ar Bonnfam e ti dir li ki li ti anvi marye ar Prenses Labam.
“Ayo, beta ki ou pe fer? Ena lamor ladan! Ou kone komie prens ek lerwa finn pous bor e zwenn lamor. Papa Prenses Labam dir zot fer enn travay difisil e si zot pa reysi, li fer touy zot. Ale, mo garson. Pa res isi. Ole maryaz pou ena lanterman.”
Me Prens ti desid pou ekout zis so leker.
Lerwa pa ti perdi letan. Enn group solda ti vinn sers li kot Bonnfam. Zot ti amenn li kot lerwa ki ti donn li 80 liv lagren moutard pou kraze e tir dilwil e ti donn li ziska lelandime-gramaten pou fini louvraz la. Lerwa ti dir li, “Seki anvi marye ar mo tifi bizen kapav fer seki mo dimande. Si pa kapav, mo sot likou.”
Pa bizen dir ki Prens ti dan tourdisman. Kouma pou kraz tousa dan mempa enn zour? Enn kou li ti pans Lerwa Fourmi e san atann Lerwa Fourmi ek so larme ti paret divan li. “Vot Altes, ki pe fatig ou?” Lerwa Fourmi ti dimande.
“Lerwa finn donn mwa 80 liv lagren moutard pou kraze dan enn zour. Si mo pa reysi, li pou fer touy mwa.”
“Samem ou problem, Vot Altes. Ale, al repoz ou. Les sa dan nou lame. Dime gramaten ou pou kapav al ofer Lerwa so dilwil.” Prens ti al dormi letan larme fourmi ti pe fer enn travay prop.
Ler li ti leve, dilwil ti pare. Prens ti pran dilwil pou donn Lerwa. Lerla Sa Mazeste ti dir li ki ti ena enn deziem tes. Li ti pou bizen lager e touy de demon lerwa. Bizen rapel ki bien lontan Lerwa ti may 2 demon e kouma li pa ti kone ki pou fer ar zot, li ti ferm zot dan enn kazot sekirize. Li ti per pou larg zot tansion zot devor popilasion net. Akoz sa li ti obliz bann pretandan touy demon pou gagn lame Prenses. Dan so leker, li ti pe dir limem, “Si par sans zot touy demon, lerla mo pou reysi debaras enn nwizans e anmemtan gagn enn zann ki pou ranplas mwa kan mo mor.”
Kan li ti aprann ki li ti bizen touy de demon, Prens ti panike. Enn sans li ti pans tig e Tig ek so partner ti paret divan li. “Ki pe akable ou, Vot Altes?” Prens ti rakont zot so problem. “Samem tou? Kit tou dan nou lame!”
Prens ti tir de manto rwayal dekore ar pier presiez depi sak mazik e li ti poz zot lor ledo Tig ek so partner. Lerla, li yi amenn zot kot Lerwa. “Vot Mazeste, eski ou permet mo de kamarad Tig lager dan mo plas?”
Lerwa ti dakor. Plis enportan pou li ti debaras sa de nwizans la.
“Si koumsa, Vot Mazeste, larg demon e les Tig manz ar zot.” Apre enn long lalit, de Tig ti touy de demon.
Lerwa ti bien kontan. Prens ti dimande si kapav selebre maryaz. Lerwa ar enn sourir mesanste ti dir, “Res ankor tes. “Lao dan lesiel mo ena mo tanbour rwayal. Seki pou marye ar mo tifi bizen kapav anvole, al lao e al tap tanbour la.”
Prens ti kone ki ti bizen fer. Li ti al kot Bonnfan, ti mont lor so lili mazik e ti dimann li amenn li kot tanbour rwayal ti ete. Lor vites lili ti amenn li laba e Prens ti tap enn sega lor tanbour sitan for ki tou dimoun ti tande. Ler li ti retourne, li ti al get Lerwa ki ti dir li ki ti ena enn dernie tes.
Lerwa ti montre li enn trondarb masif ki ti tonbe dan lakour rwayal. “Ala enn lars anlasir. Si to koup tron la ande as lars lasir, to pou gagn lame mo tifi. To ena ziska dime.”
Prens nepli ti kone ki li ti kapav fer pou sap so lavi e marye ar Prenses Labam. Aswar li ti al get li. “Gate, mo kwar sannkoutla, mo finn zwenn tase.” “Kifer?” “Kouma pou koup enn tron masif ar enn lars lasir?”
“Pa trakase, koko! Mo ena so solision.” Li ti ris enn bren seve depi so latet e li ti donn li Prenses.
“Fer atansion, pa les personn tande. Dir trondarb la, ‘Prenses Labam ordonn ou les so bren seve koup ou ande’. Apre fixe bren seve la otour lam ansir lars la.
Prens ti fer kouma ti dir li e kouma seve lor lam lars ti tous tron la, li ti fann ande.
Lerwa ti satisfe. “Aster to kapav vinn mo zann ek mo eritie.”
Ti selebre enn gran maryaz kot tou ban gran-gran dimoun ti prezan. Apre detrwa zour, Prens ek Prenses ti desid pou al dan pei Prens. Papa Prenses ti dakor e ti donn zot tou led neseser. Dan pei Prens ti ena bel fet pou akeyir zot.
Zot ti viv bien ere e zot ti gagn de zanfan. Premie li ti enn tifi e deziem la ti enn garson.
Prens ti gard presiezman so lili, so bol, so sak ek so baton. Me zame li ti finn bizen servi baton la. Lape ti pe regne partou.

OUR KIDS ARE BORED!
OUR KIDS ARE BORED!
There is a general belief that school violence is on the rise. Teachers, headmasters and self-appointed ‘pedagogues’ think parents are to blame for they have no time to look after their offsprings. They seem to agree with George Bernard Shaw who once said that since we need a licence to drive a car, it is not inconceivable that a licence may be needed to have the right to procreate.
Are our primary classes boring or exciting? Most people who earn a living thanks to the schooling industry, will find exciting the product of their bland, routine and unsound method. Do they want to know the truth? And what is that truth?
Thousands of children are firsthand witnesses and victims of violence at home. 75% of the population are either non-literate or semi-literate. If 90% of the population have Mauritian (Mauritian Creole/MC) as L1 (mother tongue), 75% of the global population are monolingual speakers of MC and they belong to the working and lower working classes. 25% belong to the middle and lower middle classes where we find people who are basically literate for most and functionally literate for some.
Take an average state primary school class of 32 pupils. We can expect 8 to come from the lower middle class for most middle-class kids go to private institutions, 16 from the working class and 8 from the lower working class. The 8 from the lower middle class will shine not because they are more intelligent but because the school curriculum is tailored for middle class needs and values and they have extra-school support (parental support and private coaching) while the 8 from the lower working class are socially and culturally at a complete loss and their parents, if there are any, cannot help as they are themselves non-literate and non-numerate. A few working-class kids may scrape through but the vast majority cannot cope.
The official literacy rate of which politicians boast is a BIG lie for it is not based on reading, writing and counting abilities but on school attendance. Schooling does not lead to literacy and numeracy automatically specially when it is based on the most unsound and absurd language policy known in this world. LITERACY AND NUMERACY SHOULD START IN THE L1 OF THE CHILD, NOT IN 2 OR 3 FOREIGN LANGUAGES. As a result of this absurd approach to learning, more than 50% of our children fail to master the basics of literacy and numeracy after 6 years at school and the political and educational leaders prefer to turn a blind eye. “Prevocational classes” and “extended programme classes” are just political tricks to avoid accepting that the system is rotten. The much-needed reform is simply ignored.
BOREDOM AND VIOLENCE
Most children feel as aliens in the school environment and their inability to cope with what they are supposed to master, leads to boredom and boredom may generate some form of violence which may be perceived as some form of self-defence.
Let us not forget that besides domestic violence, rampant violence in certain regions is ‘daily bread’. But there is worse. Denying children the right and possibility to use their L1 for the acquisition of basic literacy and knowledge is a very bad and dangerous form of MENTAL VIOLENCE.
Political and education leaders are middle class people and it seems normal for them to feather their own beds and the present system is excellent for them. They will not change a system which promotes and sustains middle class interests and values. As time goes by, things will get worse not only in terms of bullying and harassment but also in terms of frustration of teachers who will also face more subtle forms of violence in the future. Has it already started?

ARET KOZ NENPORT!
ARET KOZ NENPORT!
Yesterday (Friday 05.08.22) I heard a political leader say that he refuses to ‘fer politik’ (indulge in politicking) for our problems are too serious and urgent. He opts for the search of what he considers to be enduring and lasting structural changes and not demagogy. Very noble, you would say. But in fact, it was a far cry. Demagogy was oozing out from every pore of his body. He came out with an avalanche of cliches and half-baked concoctions aimed at impressing NOT at enlightening.
I promise not to bore you with his ‘jare-filant’ (explosive diarrhea) but show you with one or two examples how low some people have fallen. And yet they think they can save our country, nay, the world. Suffice it to say that ideologically he is not different from the neoliberals of all the other ‘major’ political parties. He only claims that he is better.
ON FOOD SECURITY
His superficial knowledge should shock but it doesn’t in a country where ‘nenport’ is considered ingenious. Not a word on the need to replace the present staple foods (rice and wheat flour) by locally grown staple foods (breadfruit, jackfruit, cassava, potato, sweet potato, maize/corn and arrowroot). Not a word on the need to change our eating habits which are the root causes of several pathologies such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity.
ON MEANS TEST
He proposes a means test to reduce government spending (pensions, health, education and transport). Does he know that ‘means tests’ have been abandoned because they are very expensive on the one hand and generate corruption on the other? Moreover, they are neither fair nor efficient.
ON EDUCATION
Does he know that more than 70% of our population are non-literate? A few among them can just draw their names on a piece of paper. Does he know why party symbols are found on ballot papers? What are his plans?
POLITICS AND POLITICKING
He claims to abhor politicking BUT this is what he did during 2 hours. The Maritime Republic of Mauritius needs political thinkers and leaders to lead us from globalisation to localisation; from ethnic politics to supra-ethnic politics; from the plundering of nature to harmony with nature. Ce n’est pas demain la veille!

LAMOUR KI ZIS PRAN OU KI ZIS DONE
Pou Loga, Gerard, Saskia, Sam, Anushka, Zaynah, Taz, Yann ek Rachel
SELFISH OR SELFLESS LOVE?
Li fasil tom dan piez kan nou kwar
Ki bizen swazir ant lamour fay
Ki zis pran ek lamour partaze.
Lergete nou bizen toulede
Si nou pa ole sap dan karay
Pou fini dan dife marenwar.
Lavi li bien bizen linite
De kontrer pou kapav diboute.
Lamour ki pran, pran, pran san done
Li lamour egois bachara.
Me lamour zenere ki pa’le aksepte
Lamour ki lezot pe partaze,
Li osi danzere ki lotla
Parski li ‘si pa ekilibre.
Si nou’le bien reysi nou lavi
Bizen enn bon melanz de lamour:
Lamour ki nou done ek lamour
Ki konn pran san ekzazerasion.
Si to pa kontan twa, pa kapav
To kontan to prosen, ni Bondie.
Si to tro kontan twa, mem zafer.

SO BON, SO MOVE
Tou kiksoz ena so bon, so move.
Nou bizen aprann swazir pozitif
E met dan enn kwen seki negatif.
Ena seki bon mem dan so move.
Teknolozi donn nou boukou lasans
Me malerezman ena move ‘si.
Enternet kapav devlop konesans
E innyorans ‘si, si mal servi li.
Kan viv lot manier, nou servi lespri
Pou ogmant biennet, pa zis pans profi;
Servi enternet pou ogmant lafors
Solidarite ek alim nou tors;
Konfor pa vedir viv dan bwat koton
Si nou konn separ kreson ek lastron.

DESCARTES AN MORISIEN
RENÉ DESCARTES AN MORISIEN
René Descartes: DISCOURS DE LA METHODE; 4em partie; 1er paragraphe
Je ne sais si je dois vous entretenir des premières méditations que j’y ai faites; car elles sont si métaphysiques et si peu communes, qu’elles ne seront peut-être pas au goût de tout le monde: et toutefois, afin qu’on puisse juger si les fondements que j’ai pris sont assez fermes, je me trouve en quelque façon contraint d’en parler. J’avais dès longtemps remarqué que pour les moeurs il est besoin quelquefois de suivre des opinions qu’on sait être fort incertaines, tout de même que si elles étaient indubitables, ainsi qu’il a été dit ci-dessus: mais pour ce qu’alors je désirais vaquer seulement à la recherche de la vérité, je pensai qu’il fallait que je fisse tout le contraire, et que je rejetasse comme absolument faux tout ce en quoi je pourrais imaginer le moindre doute, afin de voir s’il ne resterait point après cela quelque chose en ma créance qui fût entièrement indubitable. Ainsi, à cause que nos sens nous trompent quelquefois, je voulus supposer qu’il n’y avait aucune chose qui fût telle qu’ils nous la font imaginer; et parce qu’il y a des hommes qui se méprennent en raisonnant, même touchant les plus simples matières de géométrie, et y font des paralogismes, jugeant que j’étais sujet à faillir autant qu’aucun autre, je rejetai comme fausses toutes les raisons que j’avais prises auparavant pour démonstrations; et enfin, considérant que toutes les mêmes pensées que nous avons étant éveillés nous peuvent aussi venir quand nous dormons, sans qu’il y en ait aucune pour lors qui soit vraie, je me résolus de feindre que toutes les choses qui m’étaient jamais entrées en l’esprit n’étaient non plus vraies que les illusions de mes songes. Mais aussitôt après je pris garde que, pendant que je voulais ainsi penser que tout était faux, il fallait nécessairement que moi qui le pensais fusse quelque chose; et remarquant que cette vérité: Je pense, donc je suis, était si ferme et si assurée, que toutes les plus extravagantes suppositions des sceptiques n’étaient pas capables de l’ébranler, je jugeai que je pouvais la recevoir sans scrupule pour le premier principe de la philosophie que je cherchais.
VERSION MORISIEN
Pa kone si mo bizen koz lor mo bann premie meditasion parski zot telman abstre e telman etranz ki boukou dimoun pou rezet zot, trouv zot innaxeptab. Me si mo kwar ki baz mo reflexion li solid, mo oblize koz sa. Mo finn remarke par experyans ki parfwa li paret neseser ki nou adopte serten lopinion, mem si ena dout, e fer vadire pa ena okenn dout. Me parski mo rod konn laverite, mo kwar ki li neseser ki mo bizen rezet kategorikman tou lopinion kot mo pa sir san pour san. Sa kondision la li neseser pou ki mo sir net ki dan mo reflexion pa ena plas pou dout ousa foste. Li kler ki nou bann persepsion sansoryel ( lenformasion ki nou lizie, zorey, pale, nene, bann diferan parti nou lekor donn nou) kapav anbet nou. Akoz sa mo prefer fer atansion ar lenformasion sansoryel pou pa tom dan piez laparans, fos realite, realite fos; mo prefer dir ki zot pa ekziste. Dimoun souvan fane e tom dan fos konklizion lor bann senp ti kestion zeometri. Akoz sa mo panse ki mo’si mo finn kapav fer erer. Li preferab ki mo rezet tou seki mo ti kwar vre. Ki diferans ena ant seki mo trouve, tande ek santi kan mo pa pe dormi ek seki mo reve ler mo pe dormi? Kikfwa seki mo kwar bien reel li pa nanye plis ki enn rev. Me deswit enn nouvo lide rant dan mo latet: Kisannla pe panse ki tousa fos? Mwa. Mwa ki pe panse. Mwa ki mwa? Mo kiksoz ki ekziste. Kouma mo kone? Parski mo panse. Mo ekziste parski mo lespri travay. Mo sir ki mo la parski mo lespri travay. Sa personn pa kapav rezete. Mo kone mo la parski mo lespri pe travay. Wi, mo finn gagn li. Samem premie prensip filozofik: Cogito ergo sum; Je pense donc je suis; I think therefore I am; Mo kone mo la parski mo lespri pe travay.

IN ENGLISH
I am in doubt as to the propriety of making my first meditations in the place above mentioned matter of discourse; for these are so metaphysical, and so uncommon, as not, perhaps, to be acceptable to everyone. And yet, that it may be determined whether the foundations that I have laid are sufficiently secure, I find myself in a measure constrained to advert to them. I had long before remarked that, in relation to practice, it is sometimes necessary to adopt, as if above doubt, opinions which we discern to be highly uncertain, as has been already said; but as I then desired to give my attention solely to the search after truth, I thought that a procedure exactly the opposite was called for, and that I ought to reject as absolutely false all opinions in regard to which I could suppose the least ground for doubt, in order to ascertain whether after that there remained aught in my belief that was wholly indubitable. Accordingly, seeing that our senses sometimes deceive us, I was willing to suppose that there existed nothing really such as they presented to us; and because some men err in reasoning, and fall into paralogisms, even on the simplest matters of geometry, I, convinced that I was as open to error as any other, rejected as false all the reasonings I had hitherto taken for demonstrations; and finally, when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations) which we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are asleep, while there is at that time not one of them true, I supposed that all the objects (presentations) that had ever entered into my mind when awake, had in them no more truth than the illusions of my dreams. But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus thought, should be somewhat; and as I observed that this truth, I think, therefore I am (COGITO ERGO SUM), was so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged by the sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might, without scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of which I was in search.

VIV ENN LOT MANIER?
POSIB SA? KIFER NON!
             NANYE PA BOUZFIX
Soley pe vieyi, so zour pou fini;
Liniver grandi ziska so kramkram
– Liniver li ne, grandi ek fane;
Depi koumansman, lavi finn sanze.
Keyet, agrikol vinn endistriyel
Ki pou oblize aret bat lezel.
Seki la zordi dime pou fini;
Istwar pa pou vinn Zordi-Net-Tamam.
Viv enn lot manier? Enn nesesite!
Nou planet pe mor; klima li ankriz;
Gardien-zardinie finn vinn brakonie;
Limanite finn vinn exper betiz.
Si nou pa sanze, viv enn lot manier,
Dime pou met ba lanfer lor later.

          KAN GLOBAL MONT LOR KES
Avion lezel plat pou tas lor tarmak;
Kargo ar vant vid pa pou mont dadak
Kan nou pou konpran lenerzi zordi
Oblize dormi dan lakav modi.
Globalizasion lerla plor disan
Parski tou bann pep dan tou kontinan
Pou bizen devlop enn nouvo kiltir:
Prodwir zot bezwen san bles lanatir.
Limanite pou oblize lerla
Devlop sororite-fraternite
Dan kiltir partaz-solidarite
Ki pou permet nou viv anarmoni
Ar tou kreatir Fona ek Flora
Pou ki vrevremem nou later beni.

OPEN LETTER TO PM&LOP
DEV VIRAHSAWMY
5, Edwin Ythier Street, Rose Hill, 71368, Mauritius
limemsa@gmail.com https://boukiebanane.com
OPEN LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION
ON LITERACY AND MODERN LIVING
Sorry mates,
You both have missed the boat! Just like SSR, SAJ, SGD, NR, PRB. Like most Mauritians, you neither understand the importance of national literacy nor do you know or want to know how to achieve it.
SOME FACTS:
1. In the 1950’s, primary schooling was made free and quite accessible to most children;
2. In the 1970’s, secondary schooling was made free and quite accessible to most children;
3. Yet 75% of the population are non-literate and non-numerate (they cannot read, write and count).
WHY IS THAT SO?
1. The main reason is the refusal to use the children’s mother tongue not as a subject or support language BUT as the main medium of instruction. Mauritian (Mauritian Creole) is the first language (L1) of over 90% of all children. Not accepting a sound pedagogical principle is a form of brutality, torture and denial of our children’s rights. It is, without any doubt, a form of ‘mental rape’.
2. It is generally believed that literacy is not a necessity for good living. BUT IT IS!
3. Politicians favour voting based on party symbols and ‘block vote’ and not on voters choosing individual candidates which is possible if and only if they can read the names of candidates.
4. Media outlets (private and public, written and electronic) only pay lip-service to the promotion, development and standardisation of our national language and the mother tongue of over 90% of the population.
5. Ignorance of creolistics, a branch of linguistics, is a key problem. Do we know that English, the UNIVERSAL language of planet Earth, is a creole language?
6. Do we know and want to know that President Macron of France has just admitted that French has already lost the battle against English and that important legal French documents (passport, ID card etc.) are now bilingual (French and English)?
7. Do we know or want to know that when European leaders meet, they mostly use English as the main tool of international communication?
8. Do we realise that language loyalty in favour of French or any ancestral language (Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Urdu etc.) is a major obstacle to national development and these languages should be taught as foreign languages, once basic bilingual literacy (in Mauritian and English) has been achieved?
QUE FAIRE?
Universal literacy is NOT a luxury but a fundamental tool for economic, political, social and cultural development.
The right language policy can make of our Republic a world model for universal functional literacy. We have the needed resources but ‘bizen tir katarak dan lizie’. Ayo! DIFISIL OUVER LIZIE TANG!

WHY ARE OUR CHILDREN BORED STIFF?
DEV VIRAHSAWMY

WHY ARE OUR CHILDREN BORED STIFF?
I promised myself not to write on this issue again, feeling that over a period of more than 50 years, I have been repeating myself ‘ad nauseam’. However, a few days ago, after listening to a debate on the ‘so-called’ indiscipline and unruliness of our youths at school on a local private radio station, I realised that most schoolteachers and principals haven’t got a clue about what is really happening and consequently, a string of outdated clichés are spewed out, wrapped in a semblance of wisdom.
QUANTITY WITHOUT QUALITY
Soon, formal schooling for post-toddlers, bipeds and young teenagers will be altogether free and accessible to one and all to the great satisfaction of successful ballot-boxes, of the teaching personnel who will enjoy employment security and of parents freed from childcare and thus able to enter income-generating employment. What a happy world! BUT …! Unfortunately, there is a ‘but’.
Rampant boredom and its Siamese twin, unruliness, will go on the rise, n’en deplaise à nos gouvernants. Pa ankoler, Misie-Madam! WHY?
Simply because we prefer to ignore priorities to satisfy different vested interests.
What is the main aim of BASIC SCHOOLING? Is it not basic LITERACY and NUMERACY?
HOW IS IT DEFINED BY UNESCO?
(https://www.unesco.org/en/literacy/need-know)
“Acquiring literacy is not a one-off act. Beyond its conventional concept as a set of reading, writing and counting skills, literacy is now understood as a means of identification, understanding, interpretation, creation, and communication in an increasingly digital, text-mediated, information-rich and fast-changing world. Literacy is a continuum of learning and proficiency in reading, writing and using numbers throughout life and is part of a larger set of skills, which include digital skills, media literacy, education for sustainable development and global citizenship as well as job-specific skills. Literacy skills themselves are expanding and evolving as people engage more and more with information and learning through digital technology.”
WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF LITERACY ACCORDING TO UNESCO?
“Literacy empowers and liberates people. Beyond its importance as part of the right to education, literacy improves lives by expanding capabilities which in turn reduces poverty, increases participation in the labour market and has positive effects on health and sustainable development. Women empowered by literacy have a positive ripple effect on all aspects of development. They have greater life choices for themselves and an immediate impact on the health and education of their families, and in particular, the education of girl children.”
WHAT IS THE STARTING POINT?
Basic literacy and numeracy must start in the mother tongue of the child and not in 1, 2 or more foreign and ancestral languages. What is a mother tongue? It is the first language (L1) which children learn while still in the mothers’ womb. Remember that our DNA is programmed with the basics of ‘universal grammar’ and in our brain there is an area known as the Broca’s area which generates speech. The oral form of our first language/mother tongue comes naturally but reading and writing even our first language is an entirely different matter which demands great efforts, schooling and expert coaching. Just imagine the stress and trauma (exhaustion, confusion, sadness, anxiety, agitation, numbness …) of children being forced to master basic literacy and numeracy in one or more languages they do not even master. Are we not all guilty of crime against our own children?
BILINGUAL LITERACY
Know the resources at your disposal if you want to develop. We are very fortunate to have as our national language (Mauritian/MC) and our official language (English) TWO creole languages which are both analytic (as opposed to French, which is synthetic) with very close syntactic affinities. A well-designed literacy programme can make all Mauritians FUNCTIONALLY literate in both languages.
Why dilly-dally? Is it because the political elite wants to keep us in darkness and ignorance and feather the beds of their protégés? I can see no other reason. I only wish they could and would prove me wrong.
WHAT ABOUT FRENCH?
President Macron recently admitted that French had already lost the battle against English. French official documents are more and more bilingual – in French and English. European leaders use English to discuss European affairs. English is already a universal language. Are we not lucky to have two creole languages as our national, official and universal language? When will we learn to count our blessings?
French, being a very complicated synthetic-inflecting language in which syntactic relations within sentences are expressed by inflection (the change in the form of a word that indicates distinctions of tense, person, gender, number, mood, voice, and case), is the root-cause of ‘illetrisme’ in France.
It is a monstrous mistake to introduce it in preprimary and primary classes as a medium to acquire literacy and numeracy when it should enter the curriculum at the start of secondary education as a ‘foreign’ language. Remember that it is the first language (L1) of only 3.8% of the population, while Mauritian (Mauritian Creole/MC) is the L1 of 90% of the population and the L2 of the remaining 10%. The Catholic Church and the printed and electronic media are, through their Francophone-Francophile bias, to blame. Will they change? When? “KAN POUL GAGN LEDAN!”
A NEW LANGUAGE POLICY
Since 1954, primary education has been made free and accessible to most children of school-going age; in 1976, secondary education was made free and accessible to most of our children; in the 80’s PREVOC was introduced to look after children in difficulty who were dropping out of the system; recently, the EXTENDED PROGRAMME was introduced to replace PREVOC.
Next year, as from January 2024, preprimary schools will become free and accessible. The state education budget is enormous but are we getting value for money? Are schools delivering the ‘goods’ promised? Or have they become ‘garderie’ to keep children off the street?
75% of our children, after 9-10 years at school – SOF BAN LEKOL – remain non-literate and non-numerate. And our irresponsible political and socio-cultural leaders still refuse to admit that a new language policy in education and nation-building is IMPERATIVE. Their vested interests have priority over everything else.
BOREDOM GALORE
For most children, nothing exciting happens at school. Boredom has ‘sovereign sway and masterdom’. At the end of 9-10 years of frustration, they will, most of them, end up in a situation worse than they knew before crossing the school threshold initially.
If bilingual literacy in Mauritian and English were to support the development of a truly Mauritian-Republican National Culture in terms of national literature, drama, music, science and technology; if French and/or ancestral languages were introduced at a later stage when children have mastered bilingual literacy and have reached a certain degree of maturity, then school would become exciting, rewarding and life-enhancing.
AND BOREDOM WOULD FACE SOME DECLINE, HOPEFULLY.

Mazeste Falokrat fer nou kwar

Finn donn li, lor later, tou pouvwar
Pou diriz tabisman, lasanble,
Relizion, san partaz ou zistwar
Depi yer ziska leternite.
Bann ki pa ekout li pou fini
Dan dife ki Satan pe nouri.
Tank ena divizion ant deziem
Ek trwaziem, Mazeste Falokrat,
Jennder Enn, pou regne san problem
Me si deziem ek trwaziem jennder
Desid pou met ansam zot leker,
Lavi falokrat pou bien-bien mat.

 ON BHAJANS
Bhajan refers to any devotional song with a religious theme or spiritual ideas, specifically among Indian religions, in any language…
The term ‘bhajan‘ is also commonly used to refer a group event, with one or more lead singers, accompanied with music, and sometimes dancing. A bhajan may be sung in a temple, in a home, under a tree in the open, near a river bank or a place of historic significance…
Having no prescribed form, or set rules, bhajans are normally lyrical and based on melodic ragas…
A Bhajan may be sung individually, but more commonly together as a choral event wherein the lyrics include religious or spiritual themes in the local language… The Bhajans in many Hindu traditions are a form of congregational singing and bonding, that gives the individual an opportunity to share in the music-driven spiritual and liturgical experience as well as the community a shared sense of identity, wherein people share food, meet and reconnect. Bhajans have played a significant role in community organization in 19th and 20th century colonial era, when Indian workers were brought to distant lands such as Trinidad, Fiji, Mauritius and South Africa as cheap labour on plantations…
Everyone in the Hindu tradition is free to compose a Bhajan with whatever ideas or in praise of any deity of their wish. It is normally sung…
[Thank you WIKIPEDIA]

WHY A FEW SUCCEED WHERE MOST FAIL?
Recently, while we were talking about the different aspects of the literacy issue, my son-in-law, Sam Naidoo (65 years old), asked me if I could explain why and how he succeeded in mastering functional literacy and numeracy although his home language was Mauritian Creole (MC) and his parents possessed only a few rudiments of basic literacy and could not be considered literate. I found it a very pertinent question. And I thought about my own history.
I was born in Quartier Militaire of Telugu parents and grew up in Goodlands. Both parents spoke MC, my mother tongue, to each other and to me. My mother, Gouna, was a fan of Ti-Frer and sang his songs to me. I still remember a few lines from the songs:
1. Letan mo ti kontan twa Lilinn
Personn pa ti kone.
Aster mo kit twa, mo ale,
To pik mwa dan zournal.
2. Pa bate li misie,
Ayo mo gran misie!
Li pe koz laverite,
Li pa enn pares,
So saret ti tas dan labou.
3. Charlio, Charli
Aret bwar, aret bwar diven banann!
Dan diven banann ena bebet sizo.
I went to Goodlands Government School and my class was never packed as classes are today. I believe that most pupils were from middle and lower middle-class backgrounds. Very few working-class parents would send their children to school for girls were to help their mothers with household chores and boys were to help their fathers in the field or look after domestic animals. Moreover, teachers were mostly townspeople.
At school, I had to learn to read, write and speak English and French; to know the 11 multiplication tables (table 2 to table 12) from top to bottom and from bottom to top in MC; learn basic Arithmetic; know some geography; and learn good handwriting (penmanship). Teachers not only had small classes to control but they also gave personal-individual (not big group as today) private tuition for a modest fee.
I was a lower middle-class child and very lucky for both parents had mastered basic literacy and numeracy. I had the necessary back up from parents and personal private tutors.
It is to be noted that my paternal grandfather was a ‘sirdar’, in charge of several sugar estate workers; my maternal grandfather was a ‘marker’ (he could read and write basic things such as names, dates and time) and was responsible to keep a register of all workers in his department. Literacy was part of my family culture. Both grandfathers also invested in small businesses successfully and became respected notables in their villages.
School was responsible for the development and prestige of an elite. In the 1970’s, the scene changed dramatically. The authorities decided that schooling should be compulsory for all and parents who do not send their children to school would face legal action. Schools, classes, teachers, and pupils grew in number and size – a good thing in itself – but no thought was given to the need to question ‘medium of instruction’ which remained the same. Working-class and lower working-class children, a great majority in all classes, were totally lost. WHY?
School promoted middle-class culture and working-class and lower working-class children found themselves in an alien environment. Classes became more and more unruly. As examination standard was deliberately lowered to help more children through, the small elite scored very high marks. Moreover, private fee-paying schools started to flourish for middle-class parents wanted something better for their children.
Vote-catching strategies turned a blind eye to real problems. The refusal to use the mother tongue of most Mauritians, i.e. MC, as medium in the initial stage of education, has continued to this day and consequently 70% of the population have remained non-literate and non-numerate. Thousands of kids remain totally non-literate and non-numerate after up to 10 years at school.
ANYTHING WE CAN DO? In a recent article, this is what I proposed.
“Much time has been wasted. A radical change will rouse passions and generate hostility. I would like to propose an alternative which will not upset the applecart and allow for a smooth transition: Mauritian-English Bilingual Literacy (MEBL). How to do it? In all Extended Programme (EP) classes, we introduce MEBL for 45 minutes per day and ‘Arismetik’ (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) together with the memorisation of multiplication tables for another 45 minutes per day. My book, “TIKOU-TIKOU TOUY LOULOU” can be used to train teachers and prepare pedagogical material for learners. This will definitely raise the standard of education and pave the way to major reforms.”
Look at this:
TAN EK ASPE/TENSE AND ASPECTS
MC
Prezan: Mo bwar dilo.
Prezan kontinie: Mo pe bwar dilo.
Prezan parfe: Mo finn bwar dilo.
Pase: Mo ti bwar dilo.
Pase kontinie: Mo ti pe bwar dilo.
Pase parfe: Mo ti finn bwar dilo.
Fitir: Mo pou bwar dilo.
Fitir dan pase: Mo ti pou bwar dilo.
ENGLISH
Present tense: I drink water.
Present continuous: I am drinking water.
Present perfect: I have drunk water.
Past tense: I drank water.
Past continuous: I was drinking water.
Past perfect: I had drunk water.
Future: I will drink water.
Future in the past: I would drink water.
The syntactic structures of MC and English are almost identical because English is also a creole language.
Why do we refuse to use resources at our disposal to make of Mauritius the land of FUNCTIONAL-BILINGUAL-LITERACY?
Mersi Sam! To kestion finn obliz mwa presiz mo panse.

08. ASPECT MARKERS IN MAURITIAN (MC)
There are 2 aspect markers in our national language. They are the progressive “pe” and the perfective “finn’. “Pe” is used to show that an action is still ongoing as in ‘Mo pe travay’. Note that this element of grammar is absent in French but fundamental in Mauritian and in English: ‘Mo pe travay/ I am working’. “Finn” suggests that an action has just been completed as in ‘Mo finn ekrir let la’ (I have written the letter). ‘Finn’ is NOT a marker of past tense which is ‘ti’. Many Mauritians do misuse basic grammar rules of our national language because they think ‘it has no grammar.‘ Last night (06.01,23) an experienced newscaster made the mistake of confusing the perfective with the progressive. At the beginning of the 7.00 p.m news, instead of saying “Mersi, ou PE resevwar nou dan ou lakaz, the lady said, ‘Mersi, ou FINN resevwar nou dan ou lakaz,’ which is correct at the end of the news WHEN IT’S OVER.
PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE ‘BONAVINI’ (carelessly).
07. LAMOUR ENN ZANFAN POU SO MAMA
Mama, mo zoli mama

Met un peu queue d’oignon/ Met enpe lake-zoyon
Mo pe vien la/ Mo pe vini
Mo fer leli/ Mo ranz lili
Pa melanz torson ek serviet/ Pa melanz kalchoul

ON SECOND THOUGHTS!
ON SECOND THOUGHTS!
I grew up in the village of Goodlands in the north of Mauritius and also spent quite some time in Quartier Militaire, a village in the centre of the island. In both villages I was taught to respect elderly people who should not be called by their names which must be preceded by attributes such as ‘Tonton’ (uncle) or ‘Tantinn (auntie). In urban areas attitudes were different and shocking for the village boy I was. There was a culture clash but I stuck to my village culture. Yet when Loga and I built our family in an urban zone we adopted a more flexible attitude. We used the respectful ‘ou’ (you) when addressing our parents but our daughters, Saskia and Anushka, could use the familiar pronouns ‘to/twa’ (thou/thee) when addressing us but the respectful term was to be used when addressing their grandparents. When our grandchildren came, they opted for the familiar mode. Loga and I did not object but we told them precautions to take, i.e., when the formal and familiar could be used. I am now 80 years old and on this I have not changed. The formal mode is used with non-intimate people and the familiar with intimates.
I must admit that I am irritated when non-intimate young people, sometime younger than my grandchildren, address me as Dev and use ‘to, twa’ in Mauritian and ‘tu, te, toi’ in French. I try to understand. Could they be influenced by “Pater Noster” in Latin or French?
In Latin: Pater noster, qui es in cœlis;
sanctificetur nomen tuum:
In French: “Notre Père, qui est aux cieux,
que ton nom soit sanctifié,
que ton règne vienne,
que ta volonté soit faite sur la terre comme au ciel.
Donne-nous aujourd’hui notre pain de ce jour.
If they can address God via the familiar mode, why should they use the formal/respectful mode when addressing a common man who is only 80 years old and may have been their teacher for several years? … And yet I don’t like it. Maybe I am not as progressive as my young fellow citizens!
                HE/SHE/THEY
In the Christian world, God is masculine-singular. “He” is the father. In Islam, Allah is assumed to be a masculine word for specific reasons, too complex to discuss here. In Hinduism, the three aspects of God, namely creation, preservation and destruction, i.e., Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, are closely related to their Shakti, i.e., Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Parvati, the three active forces of creation, maintenance and destruction. As my knowledge of Hinduism improves, I find it very hard to accept the ‘masculinity’ of God and so the pronoun ‘He’ becomes improper. I suggest “S-He” instead as subject and “S-im”as object. In French the 3rd person singular personal pronoun as subject may become ‘Ile’ ONLY when it refers to God and the object form may become ‘luie’. In the case of Mauritian, there is NO PROBLEM AT ALL for the 3rd person singular pronoun ‘li’ is gender neutral and its meaning is determined by context. Moreover, the subject and object forms are similar.
Here are some examples:
1. Ena enn sel Bondie. Li kreater; Li prezervater; Li destrikter. Anou priye Li, dimann Li montre nou bon sime.
2. Li al legliz dan so zoli rob pa pou priye me pou fer dimoun remark li.
3. Li sou, li sap lor kal brit e li bat so fam.
                  LE ROI EST MORT; VIVE LE ROI!
No, I’m not a monarchist! Yet, I must admit that the general outburst of strong emotions following the death of Queen Elizabeth II compelled me to reappraise certain symbols and review certain concepts and beliefs. I was also surprised to listen to several political observers in different French media outlets. They were surprised by the popularity of the Queen as much as I was and their words suggested some form of envy. They admitted that there was nothing in the Republic NOW to generate such popular outburst of strong emotions.
Although, initially, democratic republicanism was a marked improvement in the affairs of human development, with the passage of time it became bogged down in the mire of money and today it thrives on division, repression and corruption instead of liberty, equality and fraternity. Presidents and governments are short term symbols and values and the whole set-up lacks a precious symbol which stands the test of time and gives a sense of continuity.
In spite of this, I believe that the Republic of Mauritius can offer something different.
Mauritius is the land of immigrants who have come from different parts of the world to build a new home. Unlike the USA or Australia where millions of natives were robbed and murdered, Mauritius had no native population and is a typical Creole Island as defined by Professor Megan Vaughan. This Creole Island can show that humanity is ONE; that human creative power can raise aspirations and make us reach for the sky. This island will never be Little France or Little India for its destiny is to be a beacon to guide humanity to a culture based on love and care, solidarity and sharing, harmony with nature …
I may be wrong but I don’t mind for the dream fills me with joy.

Paran pe refiz konn laverite:
Imigran vant vid kras lor so mama
Parski li prefer rasinn enkoni
Lot kote dilo – fos idantite.
Li pa’le zanfan koz prop so prop lang;
Manz prop nouritir sort dan so later.
Seki dideor, sa ki’ena valer.
Ki bizen fer pou ouver lizie tang?
Profeser refiz rekonet esek:
Si zanfan konn lir, ekrir ek konte
Kont lafendimwa pa pou balanse.
Akoz ‘no’ leson, dalo pou koul sek.
Li pa’le zanfan koz prop so prop lang;
Manz prop nouritir sort dan so later.
Seki dideor, sa ki’ena valer.
Ki bizen fer pou ouver lizie tang?
Pret, imam, panndit, pousari, oja
Ki nek resite kouma peroke
Pa’le perdi fas si zanfan kone
Tou sekre Bondie ki dan liv sakre.
Li pa’le zanfan koz prop so prop lang;
Manz prop nouritir sort dan so later.
Seki dideor, sa ki’ena valer.
Ki bizen fer pou ouver lizie tang?
Politisien pa ole elekter
Ki kapav lir bien bann nom lor bilten.
Bez dan douniya! Tou bann pie banann
Pou perdi kosion dan sak eleksion.
Li pa’le zanfan koz prop so prop lang;
Manz prop nouritir sort dan so later.
Seki dideor, sa ki’ena valer.
Ki bizen fer pou ouver lizie tang?

Pou garanti fitir nou liniver;
Ki konsey balans ant konsomasion,

OLD & NEW
The rapidly ageing and dangerously sick NEOLIBERAL OUTLOOK built on globalisaion and the financialisation of the economy is at the heart of all our main problems and yet our economic and political pundits see everything in terms of tax-slashing and subsidy-enhancing solutions.
50 years ago, James Lovelock proposed the Gaia Hypothesis to help us understand what was happening to our planet but of course money-lobbies did everything to shut him up.
It’s now very late but, let’s hope not too late, to build a green sustainable system.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
• Replace fossil fuels by green renewable energy;
• Replace globalisation by localisation;
• Ensure food security – GROW WHAT YOU EAT AND EAT WHAT YOU GROW – and healthy eating habits;
• Reorganise Mauritius into some 20 self-contained and self-sufficient municipalities each offering all economic, political, administrative, social and cultural amenities;
• Encourage the use of muscular energy for intramunicipal transport and electric public transport for intermunicipal transport;
• Promote human-animal-plant harmony in all things.
HAVE A GOOD LAUGH!
I know. This is the stupid dream of a crazy nincompoop who is at the end of his tether.
BROTHERLY NAMASTE,
Dev Virahsawmy

INSURRECTION OR ELECTIONS?
INSURRECTION OR ELECTIONS?
With tremolo in their voices, opposition leaders, old and new, shed tears (crocodile?) and display publicly their sympathy/empathy for the suffering of the people and voice their outcry at the heartlessness of government. These patriotic and loving leaders are prepared to BE LED, so deep is their love for the people. They all hope the people will ‘desann dan lari’ (take to the street) and overthrow the government.
Some ex-ministerial-leaders turned political commentators (politologue) see clear similarities between Sri Lanka and Mauritius as for them, inter alia, a majority ethnic group is oppressing minorities. No joke! Half a century later, a political slogan of the 60s is resurfacing.
Please note that none of the genuine political lovers of the people are offering an alternative plan to alleviate the sufferings of the ‘oppressed’ people. What economic and social solutions are they proposing besides ‘ôte-toi de la que je m’y mette’ (get away from where I’m going on)?
Government is accused of high treason for their links with BJP and Narendra Modi. Would the Labour Party have a different policy if and when in power? Have you forgotten that I was taken to task by LP leaders and members for writing “THE MONSTER WE LOVE”, article in which I denounced Mr. Modi’s right-wing ideology? Would the crazy-dhoti-loving MMM dare criticise the BJP and Narendra Modi?
CIVIL WAR AND ANARCHY?
The old and new patriotic, caring and loving leaders are in a great haste to take power to save the country and people they love more than themselves. Two more years are too long a time to wait. They hope that the whole population will take to the street SPONTANEOUSLY and force the government to resign. What next? Power grab? Coup-d’état? Anarchy? Civilised general elections?
They believe that the whole population is fed-up with the government and want it to go. True or false? I wouldn’t know. However, I have my doubts. Call me ‘chatwa’ if you want. I have been called by all sorts of names, from ‘tilame’ (abnormal hand) to ‘vander’ (traitor). That has not prevented me from saying and doing what I think necessary. And I will go on.
There is a systematic campaign against the police à la Mélenchon. I believe that the loving and caring patriotic leaders are playing with fire and they will end up burning themselves.
Political parties in Mauritius, with the exception of one or two, are neo-liberal and are ideologically similar to those in power. Let the musical chair continue. I am too old, tired and sick to care.
God bless my country!

DILODISIK
Dilodisik fasil pou fer;
Dilodisik napa kout ser;
Dilodisik bon atouter;
Dilodisik peyna kesier.
Dilodisik peyna triker,
Ni enspekter, ni komiser;
Dilodisik peyna mister;
Li popiler, limem dokter.
Malsans mo ser, malsans mo frer!
Dan so sourir ena maler;
So kares nouri simitier.
Moutouk lever minn so leker.
Li pou fer twa pey bien-bien ser:
Douser ouver laport lanfer.
FALEPA
Falepa apel li laservel mwano
Parski to pe ensilte tou bann zwazo.
Falepa dir so labous plen ar krapo
Parski to pou ofans tou bann zanimo.
Partou nwar cholo, tipalto, gropalto
Pe deklar gran peto, kalipa kosto
Me zes touy konesans, kwar mwa mo matlo;
Deryer baraz kouraz finn ekrir, “BAGO”.
Kan zako fer grimas, mesaz la bien kler;
Kan zozo fer koko, tou dan lamanier;
Kan salo vinn ero tou anbalao.
Mo prefer gagn zafer ar bann zanimo,
Ki pa met dan zar me ki viv sak moman
Dapre zot natir dan zot lanvironnman.

MESAZ PAP FRANSWA
MESAZ PAP FRANSWA POU SELEBRE PREMIE ZOURNE MONDIAL BANN GRAN-PARAN EK BANN GRAN-DIMOUN
(25 Zwiye 2021)
Mo bann bon granpapa ek granmama,
“Mo ar twa toulezour” (get Mt 28, 20)! Samem promes ki nou Senier Zezi ti fer ar so bann disip avan li mont dan lesiel e zordi samem promes ki li pe repete ar twa, granpapa ek granmama. Pou twa. “Mo ar twa toulezour” se parol ki mwa, Levek Rom ki osi enn gran-dimoun kouma twa, pe dir pou selebre premie Zourne Mondial bann Gran-paran ek bann Gran-dimoun. Legliz net ar twa – plis meyer, Legliz koste ar nou -: li pran twa kont, li kontan twa e li pa’le to res tousel!
Pa kwar mo pa kone ki sa mesaz la pe tonbe kan lavi pa fasil: Kovid-19 li enn siklonn violan ki tom lor nou antret; li enn gran maler ki afekte tou dimoun me ki fer bann gran-dimoun soufer ankor plis. Enn bon kantite parmi nou finn tom malad; boukou finn mor; boukou finn perdi zot partner ousa zot fami pros; boukou finn oblize viv tousel, konfine pandan enn bon bout letan.
Bondie kone ki soufrans sakenn pe andire. Li la koste ar nou kan nou oblize fer fas tousel; nou tristes-solitid – agrave par Kovid-19 – boulvers Li. Pa bliye zistwar Sen Zoakim, granper Zezi, ki ti perdi so plas dan sosiete parski li pa ti ena zanfan; so lavi kouma lavi so madam Ann pa ti ena okenn valer. Pa bliye ki Bondie ti avoy enn anz pou konsol li. Ler li ti pe dibout tris ek mosad kot lantre lavil, enn mesaze Bondie ti paret divan li pou dir li: “Zoakim, Zoakim! Bondie finn tann to lapriyer onet ek senser.” Pent Italien Giotto, dan enn so fresko seleb, fer koumadir senn la pase dan aswar, kouma sa bann lanwit blans, san somey, kot souvenir, traka ek dezir chombo nou par lagorz.
Me kan marenwar ek so konplis Kovid-19 pe trangle nou, Bondie avoy so bann anz pou ed nou travers lapas solitid e kontinie dir nou: “Mo ar twa toulezour.” Li dir twa sa, Li dir mwa sa, Li dir nou tou sa. Akoz samem, mo anvi ki nou selebre pou premie fwa sa lane la, apre soufrans enn long period izolman e enn retour dousma-dousma ver enn lavi sosial normal. “Bondie fer ki sak granper, sak granmer, sak gran-dimoun resevwar vizit enn anz”.
Parfwa li pou ena laparans nou tizanfan; parfwa li pou kouma dimoun dan nou fami, kouma nou bann torsennkole ousa kouma dimoun ki vinn trap nou lame kan dife dan langka. Rapel enn ti gate, enn ti zes lamour-lamitie. Ayo, mo leker fermal kan mo panse ki ankor ena sitiasion kot tousa pa ekziste.
Pa bliye mesaz dan Parol Bondie. Sa li permanan. Sak zour detrwa paz Labib; detrwa lapriyer-psom; mesaz bann profet. Sa pou permet nou santi prezans permanan Bondie. Lekritir sen pou fer nou konpran seki Bondie swete ki nou fer ar nou lavi. Wi, mo matlo, Bondie avoy nou dan so karo gramaten-tanto (get Mt 20, 1-16), sezon apre sezon. Les mo dir zot mo lexperyans personel. Ler mo ti pe koste ar laz retret e ki mo ti kwar mo pe al dan tengn, mo ti tann Bondie dir mwa ki Vatikan ti bizen mwa. Bondie li zame lwen; li toultan la koste ar nou pou ed nou, ouver nou lizie, konsol nou. Li toultan la. Bondie eternel pa pran pansion.
Dan Levanzil Matie, Zezi dir bann apot: “Pa tike! Partou lor later al lapes disip; fer zot batize, vinn Kretien dapre Papa dan lesiel, so garson Zezi ek Lespri Sen; montre bannla tou seki mwa mo finn montre zot (28, 19-20). Sa bann parol la zot ena mem valer zordi parski zot fer nou konpran nou vre mision: protez nou rasinn, fer bann zenn konpran lafwa, okip bann tipti. Ekout sa bien: Ki nou mision ete zordi zour? Repons: protez nou rasinn, fer bann zenn konpran lafwa, okip bann tipti. Zame bliye sa.
Pa get laz; pa get stati sosial; pa gete si to tousel ousa ki to ena enn fami; pa gete sipa to finn vinn granmer ousa granper tro boner ousa dan tar; bliye sipa to ankor endepandan ousa to bizen koudme lezot. Vre disip Zezi pa pran pansion. Bann ki sem parol Levanzil pa pran konze. Ledikasion spiritiel nou tizanfan zame arete. Pran larout e sirtou depas to prop limit pou ki to reysi kre kiksoz nouvo.
Wi matlo! Pou twa ‘si ena enn mision spesial malgre to laz. Sitiasion grav pe dir twa: Pa bes lebra! Posib sa? Mo vie, malad-malad, fatige. Ki mo kapav fer? Kouma pou sanze? Mo finn vinn prizonie labitid. Mo prop fami dan pens. Aster pe dir mwa okip bann ki dan lamizer nwar. Kouma pou fer pou grandi mo konesans kan mo pa fouti sorti andeor mo prop lakaz? Mo solitid pe kraz-kraz mwa. Mo sir enn pake parmi zot dir: solitid pe kas mo konte! Rapel Nikomed. Li ti dimann Zezi: “Kouma pou fer pou rene kan lamor deryer laport?” (Jn 3, 4). Zezi ti dir li les souf Lespri Sen rant dan so leker; souf Lespri Sen li san frontier. Lespri Sen, parski li petri dan liberte, pa kone ki ete balizaz, ki ete frontier. Li fer seki li anvi, seki li kontan. Peyna limit.
Boukou fwa mo finn dir zot: Nou pa pou sap dan douk zordi e res parey kouma nou ti ete yer. Swa nou vinn meyer ousa nou vinn pir. “ Bondie, anpes nou vinn gounda-bachara ki travers difikilte san vinn meyer, san aprann seki bon. – Bondie, anpes nou bliye ki ena dimoun finn mor parski pa ti ena ase respirater. – Bondie ed nou konpran ki tou sa soufrans la kapav fer nou vinn pli bon, fer nou konpran nou erer, ed nou tras enn nouvo sime dan solidarite ek partaz. Bondie, ed nou konbat nou reflex egois; fer nou konpran ki “sakenn pou tou” bizen ranplas “sakenn so sakenn”. (Enc. , n. 35). Fraternite ek sororite endispansab pou lavenir limanite.
Akoz samem mo bizen dir twa ki ansam nou kapav konstrir lemonn dime ki fraternel ek amikal. Enn lemonn kot nou zanfan ek tizanfan pou viv kouma dimoun kan botan retourne. Nou bizen “marye pike pou repar ek rekonstrir lavi martirize par nou move manier”. ( ., n 77). Parmi bann pilie ki neseser pou ranz sa nouvo lemonn la, ena trwa ki twa to pou kapav ede pou met dibout: rev, memwar ek lapriyer. Prezans Bondie pou donn nou lafors pou konstrir nouvo larout, mem si nou feb ek frazil, si nou aksion li baze lor rev, memwar ek lapriyer.
Rapel promes Zoel. “Bann vie pou aprann atraver rev; bann zenn par bann vizion” (3, 1). Lavenir lemonn li garanti par lalians zenes ek gran-dimoun. Bann zenn pli for dan pran rev gran-dimoun pou fer li vinn realite. Si nou’le ki sa marse, li neseser ki rev kontinie: rev lazistis, lape, solidarite pou nouri nouvo vizion bann zenn. Sa pou garanti nesans nouvo dime. Akoz sa li endispansab ki twa, gran-dimoun, to montre ki difikilte finn fer twa vinn pli for. Pa zis enn ti difikilte me boukou toufann ki to finn traverse latet ot. Servi lexperyans yer pou fer fas difikilte zordi.
Rev ek memwar mars ansam. Kan nou rapel douler lager ki ti desir ek kraz nou, nou zanfan pou apresie valer lape. To devwar se fer zenes dekouver douler ek soufrans lager. Nou, bann vie, noumem memwar pou ki bann zenn pa fer mem erer ki nou. Edith Bruck ki ti sirviv persekision bann Zwif par bann Nazi dir avek lafors: “Mem si nou reysi ekler lespri enn sel dimoun, li vo lapenn rapel seki ti arrive mem si nou ankor pe soufer. Li azoute, “Pou mwa, gard memwar vivan li sinonim ar res vivan”. Mo pe pans mo gran-paran e bann parmi zot ki finn oblize emigre e ki konsian soufrans e difikilte kan bizen lev pake, ale. Mazinn tou sa bann dimoun ki zordi pe oblize kit zot later pou rod enn lavenir lor enn lot later. Kikfwa ena, parmi sa bann la, ki la pre kot nou e ki pe okip nou. Si nou rapel nou pou kapav konstrir enn lemonn plis imen, plis fraternel. San memwar pa kapav ena enn lemonn meyer; san soubasman pa kapav mont enn lakaz. Peyna sime! Memwar samem soubasman lavi.
Trwaziem pilie: lapriyer. Pap Benoit ki ti la avan mwa e ki kontinie priye ek travay pou Legliz ti dir: “Lapriyer vie dimoun kapav protez lemonn pli bien ki activism enn ta zenn”. Sa vie bonom sen ek beni ti dir sa ver lafen so pontifika an 2012. Zoli parol! To lapriyer li enn dibien presie: samem poumon ki endispansab pou Legliz ek lavi. (get Exhort. Ap. , n. 262). Dan sitiasion difisil ki nou pe traverse ar Kovid-19, nou tou dan mem bato e nou lapriyer anfaver lemonn ek Legliz li pa dan vid. Li montre ki nou kone ki bon pou nou.
Tou bann granmer ek granper, aksepte ki, alafen mo mesaz, mo mansionn lekzanp Charles de Foucauld, biennere e sen biento, ki ti viv kouma enn ermit dan Alzeri, lwen ar sivilizasion. So mesaz: “Nou tou imen, nou tou nou ser-frer”. Li finn montre nou ki mem si nou viv tousel dan enn dezer, nou kapav dimann Bondie ed bann pov dan lemonn e anmemtan devlop lamour pou limanite ki devlop fraternite ek sororite.
Mo dimann Bondie ed nou mars lor sime Charles de Foucauld, ouver nou leker pou fer nou pran konsians soufrans dan lemonn. Anou aprann parol konsolasion; anou fer bann zenn konpran sa mesaz la; anou fer parol la vinn vivan.
Anou ekout parol Bondie: “Mo ar twa toulezour”.
Pa bes lebra!
Bondie beni zot!

FULL OF SOUND AND FURY
Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
Debates are raging on democracy in general and parliamentary democracy in particular but it is to be noted that a few shortcomings may show either ignorance or deliberate ignoring.
It is generally believed that one of the basic principles on which true democracy is built is THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. The three powers (the executive, the legislative and the judiciary) are independent but complementary. Each has its own head. The prime minister of Mauritius heads the executive; the speaker heads the legislative and the chief justice heads the judiciary.
One self-appointed “politologue” (political commentator) was heard saying that the supreme court should be asked to comment on the behaviour of the speaker. Another said that the prime minister should have ignored the ruling of the speaker. Do they really know the fundamental principles governing democracy?
I also heard a political neophyte advocating a culture change and advising voters to vote people and not political parties. Does that new brand of political intelligence know why political symbols are found next to the names of candidates on ballot papers? If the symbols are removed the whole election edifice crumbles. Why? More than two thirds of the electorate cannot read the names of candidates because they are either non-literate or semi-literate.
One good thing. It seems that people in general, including people in government, believe that the speaker of the legislative assembly has dramatically failed. He should go. Will he have the decency to resign?

BEWARE OF SORCERER’S APPRENTICE
Quite recently, I listened to a discussion on ways and means to bring down the price of fuel. The participants (politicians, journalists, administrators, opinion leaders and a hunger striker) were unanimous about:
• the reduction of taxes on fuel;
• the need to abandon universal food and gas subsidy;
• the introduction of means test.
A means test is a determination of whether an individual or family is eligible for government assistance or welfare, based upon whether the individual or family possesses the means to do without that help.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_test).
The participants expressed their sympathy for the suffering ‘tidimoun’ and their scorn for the parasitic moneyed people and tourists who eat our bread made from subsidised flour. A means test for them (they call it ‘targeting’) is the magic formula to bring justice and raise the standard of living.
In concrete terms, what does it mean? A person or family with income X has the right to subsidised rice, flour, cooking gas etc. and if their income is X+1, they lose that right. This was proudly announced and applauded.
Let’s see what happens in practice. Say, a government run by our famous outspoken participants decides that a family of four with an income of Rs.25,000 or less will benefit from all subsidised products. If the income of that family goes up by one rupee (Rs.25,001), it will lose the right to subsidised goods.
The wise government run by the aforementioned do-gooders may introduce a graduated system:
1. Income under Rs.25,000 leads to full entitlement;
2. Income under Rs.50,000 leads to half subsidy;
3. Income under Rs,75,000 leads to one-third subsidy;
4. Income under Rs.100,000 leads to one quarter subsidy;
5. Income over Rs.100,000 leads to zero subsidy.
HOW DO YOU PUT THIS INTO PRACTICE?
First of all, each citizen must go about with a document which spells out his or her entitlement. Imagine the joy of your baker, shopkeeper or ‘dalpouri’ seller who has to calculate the price to be paid by each consumer depending on his or her entitlement.
How do you control that the right amount is paid to the authority which dispenses the subsidy? Do we have to put a police-officer in each shop or outlet? What guarantee do you have that a few corrupt police-officers will not use their prerogative to pocket thousands of illegal rupees?
Who will deliver the said documents? Civil servants, of course. Will not the door to corruption be wide open? The few black sheep in the civil service will see it as a godsend. Their power to ‘sell’ the right certificate to their appropriate clients will be enhanced.
How much will all this cost? Much more than the saving made to bring down the cost of fuel. But this is only part of the story. The means-test-walas, to be honest and credible, must go the whole hog and not focus on only food and cooking gas subsidy by proposing the following:
• Parents with means should not benefit from free-schooling for their offspring. Why should ‘WE’ waste our money on wealthy parents “who drive luxurious limos”? Teachers will simply have to wait for the complete collection of all school fees in order to receive their monthly salaries ‘as in the good old days’. Payment may be made on the 35th or even later.
• Only govt backbenchers and opposition MLAs who do not have any other source of income should be entitled to an allowance.
• Free universal medical care should be abolished. It should be free for only those whose income does not exceed a specified amount.
• Universal old age pension should be abolished. It should become a means-tested benefit.
SWEET EXCITING DEMAGOGY
A piecemeal approach to any problem is bound to give absurd results and open the door to demagogy of the type:
• Rich people buy sbsidised rice to feed their pets;
• Bakers use subsidised flour to make special expensive breads and thus make huge profits;
• Wealthy tourists eat our subsidised flour in the form of fancy breads and delicacies;
• Cooking gas is used for other purposes than cooking. It may be used to take a hot shower.
Just to make a case in favour of their demand for a price-reduction of fuel, the ‘means-test-walas’ are prepared to damage democracy, reduce freedom and increase the weight of bureaucracy. In short, they want to dismantle the welfare state.

(TO SAY THANK YOU)
Saraswati, Shakti Bramma,
Pe dir mwa kontinie sante:
Pa per pou sant “Disik Sale”,
“Trip Sere Lagorz Amare”.
Vishnou ole mo kontinie
Fer lang Moris vinn literer.
Pitie Shiva! Mo fatige!
Douler pe dir mwa, “Mwa ki la!”
Trimourti ek zot trwa Shakti
Finn donn mwa lamour, lamitie,
Boner, lape, sekirite;
Mo finn konn enn lavi ere,
Antoure ar vre afeksion
Me ‘sendrom-pos-polio’ zordi
Obliz mwa dimann Lord Shiva
Ramas mwa e permet mo nam
Al dan lekor plis meritan.
Trimourti, Tridevi, Zezi
Pardonn febles laz-maladi!
24.03.23
Brahma’s Shakti, Saraswati,
Wants me to keep on singing
“Bitter Sugar”, “Cramped Guts, Gasping Throat”.
Vishnu wants me to keep on writing
Literary Mauritian.
Help me Lord Shiva!
I’m weak and tired!
Trimurti and their Shakti
Have given me love, friendship,
Happiness, peace, security.
I have known joy
And genuine affection
But P.P.S compels me
To ask Lord Shiva
To help my soul find
A more deserving body.
Trimurti, Tridevi and Jesus
Please forgive an ailing body.

NOUS SOMMES ASSIS SUR UN VOLCAN
Un malaise profond ronge nos esprits. Covid 19 a bouleversé nos habitudes et style de vie avec ses restrictions pourtant nécessaires; le conflit entre 2 puissances (USA et Russie) et leurs alliés nous affecte directement à travers une flambée des prix et un ralentissement sensible des activités economiques. (Kan 2 lelefan lager, lerb ki kraze.) Maintenant, le renvoi des élections est la goutte qui fait déborder le verre. C’est le ras le bol!
KI ZOT PE DIR?
L’authorité étatique choisit menace et répression; un mot aussi anodin que ‘gopia’ devient une excuse pour mettre des gens en cellule policière. Du côté de l’opposition, on ne parle que de réduire ou enlever la taxe et généraliser ou augmenter les subventions, mis à part Rama Valayden qui ose venir avec des projets à court, moyen et long terme.
KI BIZEN FER?
‘Business as usual’ signifie ‘fuite en avant’. En général, les ‘pontifes’ économiques et politiques autoproclamés refusent de remettre en question leurs dogmes neoliberaux, leur ‘be all and end all’. Ils sont mentalement paralysés pour ne pas dir ‘caput’. La globalisation, la financialisation de l’économie et le néocolonialisme d’une part et la destruction de la nature d’autre part sont à la base de tous nos problemes principaux. Si nous ne changeons pas de cap, c’est la casse pipe généralisée qui est assurée.
Il faut ajouter à tout cela un problème serieux à base ethnique. Nous avons pris l’habitude de mettre sous le boisseau ce problème social qui fait surface regulièrement. Il s’agit du communalisme. Est-il normal que nous avons parqué une minorité importante dans des espaces étroits sans ressources? Pire encore, nos dirigeants pensent qu’en changeant l’appellation de ces lieux – pa site sa, rezidans sa – les problèmes sont résolus. Les Duvals et les Berengers de ce monde qui utisent cette situation pour se faire élire sont doublement responsables.
Y’a pas que ca!
Dans les annees 60 c’était ‘anvlope nou pa’le’; aujourd’hui c’est ‘Moris chota bharat hé’. On oublie souvent que Maurice est un état souverain et laïc et non pas une contrée de la grande péninsule.
NOUVO VIZION
L’énergie verte doit remplaҁer l’énergie fossile; il faut renplaҁer la globalisation par la localisation; une nouvelle culture alimentaire est devenue indispensable tout comme la responsabilité d’assurer l’harmonie entre les humains, la faune et la flore; il faut savoir utiliser nos resources culturelles à bon escient etc. Pourquoi on ne le fait pas? Simplement parce qu’à court et moyen terme tout ҁa n’est pas politiquement payant.
SILVOUPLE
Je suis au bout du rouleau. Bientôt je vais partir. The sooner, the better. Gardez vos bougies, sanbrani, koko-banann et autres guirlandes et bouquets. Ceux qui m’ont aimés ou appreciés, et même ceux qui me detestent, plantez un arbre à ‘FRIYAPEN’. Oubliyez mes cendres. Le Gange est déja hautement pollué!
Pa bizen vers dilo lizie;
Ni ou fler ki kouyonn lizie.
Plant plito enn pie friyapen
Pou ki nou zanfan manz dipen.
                Pos-skriptoum: “Misie Premie Minis, ou kapav, si ou ole, koumans dezamors bom ki ou finn ede pou amorse. Kan enn pep dan pens; kan li santi ki pe pran zanfan Bondie pou kanar sovaz; kan so lorizon dan nwarte net, ou bann menas glise kouma dilo lor fey sonz. Pa fer kouma ou papa ki ti gagn nisa menas pou koup ledwa ousa lalang. Fasil koumans koriz ou erer: ANIL RANVWA ELEKSION MINISIPAL. Fer ou devwar patriyot. Sirtou explik ou kamarad kouma ou adverser ki dan peryod Kovid pa neseser trangle demokrasi politik me ena enn nouvo fason fer kanpagn elektoral.”

LET’S FACE THE TRUTH!
1. As a result of bad political decisions and maladministration, you and I, our children and grandchildren will have to foot the bill to the tune of over Rs5,000,000,000.
Who’s to blame? Anerood Jugnauth and his ministers, including Xavier Duval, Roshi Badain, Vishnu Lutchmeenaraidoo to mention just a few. Duval and Badain are trying to “tir zot kanet dan zwe” with their favourite song, “Pa mwa sa! Li sa!” which their mentor taught them.
We have to admit that in this case Nuvin Ramgoolam was right.
2. Is it the end or only the beginning? After the Betamax case, we may have to face the music of the famous so-called Ponzi accusation.
3. One day our children and grandchildren will ask us who plotted to legally assassinate Sir Gaetan Duval.
4. We may also have to answer why the MMM has become BBB (Berenger, Badain, Bodha).
What then is the truth? Is it that our land is shepherded by Mephistopheles in the garb of a lamb?
HELP US DEAR GOD.

MY STORY
(For Susan Bard and Françoise Lionnet)
©Institut Cardinal Jean Margeot (ICJM), 1, Celicourt Antelme street, Rose Hill, Mauritius.
OVERTURE
According to official papers, I was born on March 16, 1942, in Quartier Militaire, in the district of Moka. Why Quartier Militaire? Simply because of a tradition whereby the first born of a woman should see the light of day in the house of her father. Gouna, my mother, (her official name was Damiyantee Pyndiah) was a Quartier Militaire girl, married to Ramdass (Appanah Virah Sawmy) a Goodlands boy.
I grew up in Goodlands and in 1945, at the age of three – Did I catch polio or did polio catch me? – I lost the use of my left arm completely. In those days, physical and other handicaps were considered as a curse, some form of divine punishment and in my village, there was a long list of terms used to describe and laugh at handicaps: pagla, bayra, langra, kannwa … I was called ‘moyon’. Have we changed much? I doubt it. Much later, when I chose political activism, my opponents would refer to me as “Ti-Lame” (little hand).
But there was a silver lining. My handicap helped me to understand that I should not look for compassion and had to prove that, in fact, I was better than those who had fun mocking me. When we played football, I chose to be goalkeeper; volleyball became a passion for some time and my smash was dreaded. Learning to swim or ride a bicycle was painful and yet I did it successfully.
I quickly also realised that showing that my disability was not a sign of inferiority was not enough. I had to shine in other domains. I took to painting, singing and song writing (in English, if you don’t mind) but was never very good.
At school, I was average partly because I was bored and also because I spent a lot of time on extra-curricular activities which did infuriate my father. I was also a cinema addict (enn nam sinema) who used to imitate his film idols specially James Dean and Elvis Presley.
When the School Certificate results (O levels) came and I found myself among the 10 best of my very prestigious college (St Joseph’s) something went ‘ting’ in my mind. I discovered the power of drama through Shakespeare’s ‘Macbeth’ and GB Shaw’s ‘Arms and the Man’ and wanted to know more. It became clear to me that the right path would be H.S.C and a university degree in English and French. As I was not very happy at St Joseph’s where I was constantly reminded that I was a ‘malbar’, a ‘payen’ (a pagan) and a ‘moyon’, I used my good S.C results to be admitted into Port Louis Royal College where I obtained a reasonably good H.S.C grade and was accepted by Edinburgh University.
1ST MOVEMENT
Between H.S.C results and the trip to Edinburgh, I taught English, French and fine art; was sacked twice for insubordination; fell in love with Loga; managed to be accepted by Loga’s parents; chose to travel by ship to Europe when flying was the thing to do.
A year later, Loga came to meet me as previously arranged. We got married (August 1964); Loga joined Skerry’s College for secretarial studies; I went into year 2; a year later Loga got a good job at the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce. After 2 years of sacrifice, working hard and saving to make ends meet, we could live more decently. Both of us fully enjoyed Edinburgh social, cultural and artistic life. We had some very good friends.
Edinburgh University taught me, inter alia, 3 important things:
• Creole is a language, not broken French;
• Literary criticism;
• The power and significance of plays from Shakespeare to Harold Pinter.
2ND MOVEMENT
In Edinburgh, I had politically-minded friends and I joined them in a small group which believed in “Home Rule for Scotland”. Some were Marxists, others were anarchists but they were all convinced that changes were inevitable. Listening to them made me realise that the boy from Goodlands, brought up in a family which gave full support to the Mauritius Labour Party, had a lot to learn.
When I had completed my studies in 1967, both Loga and I were in a hurry to return home for the campaign for independence was in full swing. We found a country split into two, with Hindus on one side and Creoles and Muslims on the other.
It quickly occurred to me that the main issue would soon be nation building. Independence alone was vastly insufficient. A handful of people controlling the economy, political power being determined by sectarian ethnic lobbies, blind allegiance to ancestral values were decisive toxic ingredients to ignite political dynamites.
An alternative had to be created by starting political activities along new lines. Equally indispensable was the need to build supra-ethnic values.
Years of praxis have taught me the following:
• Mauritius is a Creole island as defined by Megan Vaughan in her book CREATING THE CREOLE ISLAND, (Slavery in Eighteenth-Century Mauritius), DUKE University Press. It will never be “La Petite France” or “Little India”;
• Political slogans such as “unity in diversity” or “enn sel lepep, enn sel nasion” are empty because they are based on a static notion and fail to understand the dialectical movement between centrifugal and centripetal forces. Trying to wipe out differences will make matters worse and may generate cultural genocide. What is needed is a policy that respects differences while at the same time it promotes supra-ethnic values.
• Mauritians are of different origins. We are from Africa, Europe and Asia but we are also the products of biological and cultural miscegenation (metisaz).
• We have a common history. We are all immigrants, free or bound.
• We have a common culture: a common national language, two Creole languages (Mauritian and English), our own music and dance, and a special cuisine made of borrowings, creations and adaptations. They can provide us with a strong foundation to reach for the sky if the will exists.
Political activities have so far failed to produce the right effects and the last 50 years have made matters worse to such an extent that mainstream political parties are quite prepared to join the racist and fascist banquet.
3RD MOVEMENT
Age and sickness now force me to concentrate on what I’m not too bad at: creative writing. Verse and prose on the one hand and translation of lay and religious literature on the other are what I can still offer.
The glorious and heroic days are over and as my sun is preparing to set, I cannot help thinking that I must have made mistakes which have retarded the growth of a supra-ethnic culture. My apology to one and all.
FINALE
In my search for ‘truth’, I have wandered far and wide. Atheism, agnosticism? I’ve tasted their bitter fruits. I have also known friendly hands which have helped me from drowning.
Yet I’m happy that in the 60’s, I discovered Marxism and have since tried to use it to understand the reality in which I live, with some success. While cupidity threatens our existence, we now have a pope, Pope Francis, who does not mince his words to denounce our evil ways. Spiritual leaders must join him to tell economic and political leaders to stop worshipping mammon. We must stop our war with Nature. We are fighting a losing battle.
My personal battle goes on. Knowing who I am is now my main preoccupation. When I was born, I was given 2 Hindu names: Dev and Narendraj. Later I was told that I was a Hindu. That meant nothing to me. The best part of my education was done in Christian institutions locally and abroad. My best friends are mostly Christian.
And yet, now some fundamental Hindu concepts invite me to new thoughts. They have nothing to do with rituals or the reading of the Vedas or the Upanishads.
These concepts are:
1. There is ONE God who has 3 facets: creation, preservation and destruction. Creation is a dynamic ongoing process which necessitates destruction to bring about new creation. We are very far away from the old Testament’s view of creation.
2. God is NOT masculine-singular. He is powerless without His Shakti. God is Father-Mother in the universe.
3. Reincarnation makes life meaningful for heaven and hell are here and not elsewhere. It means that the soul has a body until Moksha when rebirth stops and the individual atma fuses into MAHATMA.
4. Moreover, there is the concept of “AVATAR” which means that God does take a human shape at times to lead humanity’s chariot which is what Krishna did in the Bhagavad Gita. For me Jesus was an Avatar. So is Pope Francis.
I do not want to persuade anybody. I am only sharing an intuition.
Because of the four concepts described above, I think I am a Hindu who has faith but is not religious.

HELLO THERE!
HELLO THERE!
ARET KOZ NENPORT!
You, parents, priests, politicians and so-called ‘profeser’, GIANT P’S, do you really know what is happening and do you really care? You have been, are and, I am sure, will be wildly vociferous in your assessment of the catastrophic situation our schools are in. BUT do you know what you are talking about?
First of all, let us get clear definitions of the words we use:
MOTHER TONGUE/LANG MATERNEL (FIRST LANGUAGE OR L1)
Most of you think it means the language of your forebears, your ancestral language. WRONG! Let me illustrate with some elements of my own history. On my father’s side, my great-grandfather and great-grandmother were native speakers of what is today known as Telugu; on my mother’s side, I have always thought that there had been some form of early forced or willing miscegenation/metisaz – (some relatives are fair skinned while others are brown or plainly black. My father knew some basic Telugu but I cannot recall my mother’s use of this language. She grew up in Quartier Militaire, spoke a flowery idiomatic “Mauritian Creole (MC)”, sang Tifrer’s songs which I learnt from her. Both parents spoke to each other in MC. It could be argued that, to a certain extent, Telugu is my ancestral language while MC is definitely my mother tongue, the language I started to learn while still in my mother’s womb.
ON CREOLE LANGUAGES
Creole is NOT the name of a language but that of a family of languages with specific characteristics. All creole languages are analytic NOT synthetic. Let us compare English, French and Latin to understand the difference:
WORD ORDER: Word order is vital for analytic languages whereas this is not always the case for synthetic languages.
Examples: I told him. (subject + verb + object); Je lui ai dit. (subject + object + verb). In Latin, a highly synthetic language, word order has little or no importance: ‘puer amat puellam’ (the boy loves the girl) has the same meaning as ‘amat puer puellam’ or ‘amat puellam puer’ or ‘puellam amat puer’ or ‘ puer puellam amat’ or puellam puer amat. In a synthetic language, word form changes to indicate meaning, not word order.
Examples: Puer/ the boy is subject; puerem / the boy is object. The girl loves the boy in Latin becomes ‘puella amat puerem’ or ‘amat puerem puella’ or etc.
WORD FORMS: in synthetic languages a word may have several forms to show grammatical case, number and gender. A French adjective may have up to 5 forms as in the case of “beau, bel, belle, beaux and belles”. In English and Mauritian adjectives keep the same form: beautiful country/ zoli pei; beautiful woman/ zoli fam; beautiful flowers/ zoli fler etc.
There are over 100 creole languages in the world and some are national and official languages as Sango in The Central African Republic; Bazaar Malay, a creole language, has, according to experts, evolved into Bahasa Indonesia, the national and official language of Indonesia; Afrikaans, another creole language, is one of the national languages of the Republic of South Africa; English which is today the universal language of Planet Earth, the official language of the USA, Australia, New Zealand, the unofficial national language of India etc. etc. is a creole language. French documents (ID card, passport etc.) are now in French and English. O crime de lèse-majesté! When European leaders meet, they use English. N’en deplaise!
Do you understand why Mauritian Creole (MC) should be known as Morisien (Mauritian), the national language of the republic and eventually the official language together with English. Is it that hard to understand? I know you are not morons though you are trying to be.
DIFFERENT LANGUAGE FUNCTIONS IN EDUCATION
In this field, as well, terms are used ‘bonavini’. There are so-called teachers who argue that MC is already used as medium in schools. These intellectual giants do not know the difference between ‘A MEDIUM OF INSTRUCTION’ and ‘A SUPPORT LANGUAGE’. The ORAL use of MC in the classroom is now widespread at all levels. When communication in the official medium collapses, teachers resort to MC, the L1 of over 90% of the classroom population, to orally explain concepts which then are translated into the official medium in which books are written and examinations taken. Try to explain ‘blank verse’ (iambic pentametre) in the official medium: “It is a rhythmic pattern that consists of ten syllables per line, with alternating stressed and unstressed syllables: da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM.”
From experience, I know that support from MC does help. Since MC is a syllabic language, it helps to teach learners how to break down words into syllables and then we can show the difference between stressed and unstressed syllables.
LANGUAGE AS SUBJECT:
In Mauritius many ethnic languages are taught as subject: French, Hindi, Urdu, Arabic, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, Mandarin etc. Recently MC called KM (Kreol Morisien) joined the league AS AN ETHNIC LANGUAGE. A very serious mistake. The language pundits of Mauritius do not know that the word ‘creole’ is polysemic (has several meanings). It refers to people (white, mulatto, afroblack), to places ( creole islands like the Seychelles, Reunion, Rodrigues, Mauritius), to a specific type of architecture, food, music and culture. MC is certainly not an ethnic language except in the diseased mind of a few segregationist racists. It is the first language of over 90% of the population of the Maritime Republic of Mauritius; it is the de-facto, though not yet de-jure, national language of the republic.
LANGUAGE AS MEDIUM OF INSTRUCTION
It is the tool used to master literacy (reading and writing) and numeracy (the ability to understand and work with numbers); to receive and give formal education; to improve the standard of knowledge in general; to develop the brain etc.
Mother tongue literacy and numeracy is the indispensable foundation stone for brain development, for capacity to acquire basic skills and knowledge and, later, for the attainment of functional literacy and the full enjoyment of the fruits of modern living. When I was working at the M.I.E, I proposed the introduction of ‘Creolistics’ to make all children literate in Mauritian and English. My most senior told me off, “Si tou dimoun konn lir, kisannla pou koup kann!” At that moment I realised that I was in the wrong place. I resigned.
Schooling has now been free and accessible for more than two-thirds (⅔) of a century (about 70 years) and yet only less than 30% of the population possess the skills of basic and or functional literacy. Why? And who is to blame? PA MWA SA LI SA!
I wonder if there is another place in the world where children are not allowed to master basic literacy skills in their mother tongue and are forced to master it in 3 foreign languages (English, French and Hindi or Urdu or Mandarin or any other ethnic languages). Politicians adore this situation which fuels tribalism and bloc-voting of party symbols. Literacy would make voters choosy and very difficult to please. From SSR to PKJ via SAJ, SGD, PRB and other NRs, this highly serious issue has been deliberately ignored for it is not vote-catching. Better invest in contract buses, picnics, rum and biryani!
What about most teachers?
As long as Mass-Private-Tuition Co. Unlimited generates high-nontaxable-income why change content and method? Keep on giving ‘shit’ as sweetmeat!
And priests? Francophone Catholicism, Anglophone Protestantism, Sanskritophone Hinduism and Arabophone Islam use MC as support to pass on basic ritual messages but important issues are dealt with in the languages of holy books ‘as they are God’s languages’(sic). Priests and politicians seem to have the same outlook. Literate people are dangerous because they ask too many questions.
PARENTS? Parents are very quick to insist on their rights to do what they think is good for their children. Do they have the right to mentally ‘rape’ their progeny by denying them the right to use their MOTHER TONGUE? Mothers should know that a baby in the womb very early starts to develop hearing and hears the mother’s voice. Baby’s Broca’s area in the brain together with the universal grammar with which human DNA is programmed, start a development process which leads to the structuring of language skills based on the language of the mother which the baby hears with more and more clarity as it grows in the womb. This is why, when babies are born, they quickly master the language of their mothers. It saddens me when I hear mothers tell their children not to use mothers’ language for it is vulgar and they should speak a foreign language which will make them intelligent. Do you know a better case of self- debasement-denigration-deprecation-depreciation? By so doing, they hinder the proper mental and physical growth of the child they say they love. Fathers are also to blame. The language they use with their wives, relatives and friends is prohibited in many homes.
MAGEMA! MO FINN PLEN DONN BOURIK MANZ LAZLE!
(Mother-O-Mother! I’ve had enough casting pearls before swine.)

KNOW WHO YOU ARE
TO FORGE THE WAY AHEAD
EARLY COLONISATION
The Dutch were the first to colonise the island, now known as Mauritius, in the 17th century and they brought slaves from Senegal where the slave market was thriving. Most probably the slaves were from the Wolof tribe. In the early 18th century when they put an end to the settlement, they left behind the slaves who later settled down in a region of Port Louis, today known as Camp Yolof. They could be considered as the first inhabitants of Mauritius, our first ‘natives’.
Under the French, slaves were brought from East Africa and probably from Mozambique and Madagascar. This gave rise to the appellation “Kreol Mazanbik”.
After the abolition of slavery, the British administration recruited workers in India and most came from Bihar and spoke Bhojpuri, a member of the Bihari group of Indo-Aryan languages. There were also workers from Maharashtra in the centre-west and Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in the south-east. In Mauritius the identity of Indian workers was determined, inter-alia, by the name of the port of embarkation. Hence Bihari workers of Hindu faith were/are called ‘Kalkita’ because they boarded their ships in the port of what was known as Calcutta (Kolkata now); workers who boarded their ships in what was known as Bombay (now Mumbai) were/are called ‘Bombay’; those who sailed from Madras, now Chennai, were/are called ‘Madras’ and ‘Korengi’ became the identity tag for those who probably left their coastal village of Korangi in the east of Godavari district, in Andhra Pradesh and became an identity tag of Telugus in general for quite some time.
Most Muslims (16-17% of the population) came from Bihar and were Bhojpuri speakers but to distinguish themselves from non-Muslims from India, they successfully carved a new identity based on language (Urdu) and religion (Islam). Moreover, they made of Pakistan the ‘pseudo-homeland’ of their ancestors and now they seem to be trying to develop some form of Arab identity.
As for the Chinese (about 3% of the population), they came in several migratory waves. They were mainly craftsmen and business people.
SOCIAL DIVISION IN MAURITIUS
Besides class division, Hindus are divided along linguistic lines (Marathi (3%), Telugu(3%) and Tamil)(6%); there are those who proudly exhibit their attachment to Bhojpuri and those who claim that they are Hindi-speaking. Bhojpuri according to Wikipedia “is considered to be a dialect of Hindi in India despite its own vast literature, grammar and script which is often a subject of debates. Bhojpuri is an Eastern Indo Aryan language while Hindi is a Central Indo Aryan language.”   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhojpuri_language.
Another division is along socio-religious practice – division between Arya Samajist and Sanatanist. To this we must add caste division.
In her paper entitled “UNDERSTANDING THE CASTE SYSTEM IN MAURITIUS”, Dr Shakun Harris writes: “Varna Dharma” was a division of labour according to the different aptitudes, capacities or qualities of people. People had a sort of achieved status. Nevertheless, the ‘varna of Brāhmans’ commonly identified with the priests and learned class, is the “Maraze” in Mauritius. The ‘varna of Kshatriyas’ associated with rulers and warriors including property owners, are the “Baboojee” in Mauritius. Besides, the ‘varna of Vaishyas’ associated with businessmen, farmers and traders are the “Vaish” in Mauritius and are also in majority on the island. At last, the ‘varna of Shūdras’, that is the servile labourers, are the “Rajput” (or “Dusadh”) and the “Ravived” (or “Chamar”) in Mauritius.
(https://medium.com/@shakunharris/understanding-the-caste-system-in-mauritius-c8fe9468c097)
Muslims are divided along religious lines (Sunni, Shia, Ahmadiyya …) but Sunnis represent the majority.
Division within the Chinese community is not visible.
What is known as ‘General Population’ is divided along physiognomic lines (skin colour, type of hair, shape of lips and nose etc.) and socio-economic lines. Hence, we have ‘Kreol Site’, ‘Kreol’, “Madras Batize’, ‘Milat’ ek ‘Blan’. There are also pejorative terms which are used such as: ‘Kreol Mazanbik’ for the negro type; ‘Ferblan’ for mulatto; or euphemisms such as ‘Zanbien’ for middle class Creoles and ‘Zandkouler’ for mulatto.
THE RAINBOW MYTH
In Mauritius, we love clichés such as ‘paradise island’ or ‘rainbow nation’ which were adopted to support our tourism promotion campaign and with time most Mauritians find it comfortable to think that they may reflect reality. But there is reluctance to dig deeper to discover the truth which may disturb our comfort zone. Truth is often unbearable.
What is the true nature of the island? Who are we really? Most of us prefer not to know.
There is a polysemic word which disturbs, confuses and baffles most Mauritians. It is the word ‘CREOLE’. It refers to a language, an ethnic group, a type of architecture and furniture, a specific cuisine and an island of a special type. But it is the language issue that generates most confusion and passion. Readers must be reminded that:
• Creole is not a language but a family of languages in which are found inter-alia Mauritian Creole, Haitian Creole, Sango, Afrikaans, English etc. There are more than 100 creole languages in the world.
• It is not an ethnic language, i.e., the language of Creoles in Mauritius. It is the first language/L1/mother tongue of over 90% of the population, more than 1,000,000 people.
• It was not created by African slaves in Mauritius but evolved from a NAUTICAL LINGUA FRANCA much used by sailors in the Mediterranean Basin from the 11th to the 19th centuries. This explains why Mauritian Creole and Haitian Creole are so similar. Please note that Haitian Creole is the first language/L1/mother tongue of 7 million people; it is the national and official language of Haiti, together with French.
Franco-Creoles love to think of Mauritius as Little France and ‘Kalkitas’ under the influence of the Hindutva ideology dream of making of Mauritius a ‘Chota Bharat’ or ‘Little India’. They will fail in their attempts for Mauritius is and will remain a creole Island as defined by Professor Megan Vaughan in her book “Creating the Creole Island”, Slavery in Eighteenth-Century Mauritius. In her own words: “by ‘creole’ I simply mean that the island, without natives, has always been the product of multiple influences, multiple sources, which to differing degrees merge, take root, and ‘naturalize’ on this new soil.”
Please note that the word ‘creole’ here has nothing to do with ethnicity.
WHAT WE ARE AND WHAT WE MUST DO
We are all immigrants here. Immigrants from different regions of Africa, some countries of Europe and some countries of Asia (India and China specially).
Trying to preserve ancestral and existing customs and values maybe praiseworthy if, and only if, they do not hinder the development and growth of new outlooks and ways of life, for it is imperative for us to chart new courses if we wish to survive and prosper. Nurturing ancestral values must be complemented by innovation and the building of a supra-ethnic national culture together with a new approach to economic and political organisation. We have to adopt a new way of life to equip us for the battle against global warming and climate change. What does this entail?
• A new language policy which paves the way to universal literacy and genuine bilingualism in our 2 creole languages i.e., our national language (Mauritian) and our official language (English); facilities are to be given for the mastering of a third and fourth language.
• Food security should be a top priority based on the principle of “eat what you grow and grow what you eat”. Our food habit must change. We cannot go on importing 85% of our food needs. Moreover, we must learn to eat healthy and thus avoid diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, pathologies which at present affect over 40% of the population.
• Mauritius should be divided into some 12-15 municipalities which are more or less self-sufficient to avoid unnecessary travelling to go to work, to go to school, to deal with administrative matters or to do one’s shopping. Intermunicipal transport and travel will be done by electric vehicles.
• Fossil fuels should be replaced by green energy – solar, wind, bagasse etc. People should be encouraged to use muscle power as much as possible. All roads should have bicycle lanes.
• We should privilege trade, commerce and economic transactions with our neighbours – Reunion, Madagascar, South Africa- to reduce the emission of CO2. Localisation should replace globalisation.
• We should learn to live in harmony with nature and not behave as predators.
This is not a political manifesto. It is a survival kit. We live on a creole Island; we speak 2 creole languages. One is vital for the building of a healthy progressive nation. The other is already a quasi-universal language. We have all, as Afro-Creoles, Franco-Creoles, Indo-Creoles and Sino-Creoles, the duty to show to the world THE NEW PATH.
Yes, the dwarf will teach the giant what is best for humanity.

LET’S START PREPARING OUR SURVIVAL KIT!
Science and the scriptures, which are complementary and not antagonistic, can help us to move from cupidity and selfishness to solidarity and sharing. The Bhagavad-Gita tells us that life is a contradiction and nothing exists without its opposite. The present mindset based on cupidity and selfishness has its own opposite which is solidarity and sharing. The Bible, in the words of the poet William Blake, tells us that God is Mercy, Pity, Peace and Love. The Koran teaches us that salvation lies in solidarity and sharing. With science and the scriptures, we have the intellectual and spiritual tools to chart a new course.
It cannot be “business as usual”.
Citizens of the republic of Mauritius must learn that you cannot have your cake and eat it; you cannot have ‘le beurre et l’argent du beurre”; you cannot “manz banann dan de bout”.
With ‘global burning’ which is more serious than global warming and ‘climate crisis’ which is more serious than climate change, the sea level will rise in a dramatic way and all coastal areas will be under water. We will have to live, work and play on less land area.
Land is our most precious resource for it provides us with living space, space for food production, industrial, administrative and cultural activities. Land should not henceforth be considered as a commodity to be sold to the highest bidder. It is to be reckoned as the most essential element of our survival kit, the unalienable rights and heritage of the nation. It is our duty to look after our land and sea, not as resources to be plundered, but as our heritage to be shepherded by diligent and honest stewards. We should be duty bound to replant our land forests and our mangrove forests and ensure biodiversity and food security.
OUR PRIORITIES
• Food security (FS): This should be based on the principle of “Eat what you grow and grow what you eat”. It also means a new food culture which helps to reduce pathologies such as obesity and diabetes. New staples such as breadfruit, cassava, corn, sweet potato, arrowroot and potato should replace imported rice and wheat. Red meat should be discouraged and poultry and fish encouraged.
• Land and country planning (LCP): The island of Mauritius could be divided into some 20 semi-autonomous, self-contained municipalities offering residence, work, culture and leisure. People without disabilities should be encouraged to use muscle power (walking and cycling) to move from one place to another. Intermunicipal transport is to be assured by electric-powered vehicles – bus and light train. Outer islands will follow suit and adopt similar policies.
• Green energy (GE): Fossil fuels must be banned. Bioenergy (sugar cane), solar panels, hydropower plants, wind turbines accompanied by energy-saving devices and culture could ensure the energy needed for home, office and all necessary utilities.
• Generalised IT (GIT): The republic is to be completely wired and all homes, offices and institutions should have easy access to the internet.
• Universal Functional Literacy (UFL): A rational, well-planned language policy will definitely produce a nation of citizens literate in at least the national and official languages (Mauritian Creole and English, two creole languages). Literacy should become a human right without which a citizen is unable to enjoy the fruits of civilization.
• Gender Equality (GE): Men and women should have equal rights and be free to choose their orientations.
• Green and Culture Tourism (GCT): Beach tourism has had its day. Green and culture tourism must be explored to make this world a better place to live in and make international solidarity and sharing a meaningful experience.
LET’S START THE DEBATE AND ACTION NOW FOR TOMORROW WILL BE TOO LATE.

LET’S BE CLEAR-SIGHTED!
OR THE RIGHT SENSE OF PROPORTION
When Rishi Sunak became the first non-white Prime Minister of UK, the vociferous Hindu socio-cultural leaders of Mauritius saw it as a great victory of Hinduism in the world.
WHO IS RISHI SUNAK?
Rishi Sunak (born 12 May 1980) is a British politician who has served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party since October 2022. He previously held two Cabinet positions under prime minister Boris Johnson, lastly as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2020 to 2022.[2] Sunak has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond (Yorks) since 2015. Ideologically, Sunak has been described as belonging to the centre-ground of the Conservative Party.
Sunak was born in Southampton to parents of Indian descent who migrated to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. He was educated at Winchester College, studied philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, and earned an MBA from Stanford University as a Fulbright Scholar. While at Stanford, he met his future wife Akshata Murty, the daughter of Indian billionaire N. R. Narayana Murthy of Infosys. After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at the hedge fund firms The Children’s Investment Fund Management and Theleme Partners.
Sunak was elected to the House of Commons for Richmond in North Yorkshire at the 2015 general election. As a backbencher, Sunak supported the successful Vote Leave campaign for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. Following the 2017 general election, Sunak was appointed to a junior ministerial position in Theresa May’s second government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Local Government in the 2018 cabinet reshuffle. He voted three times in favour of May’s withdrawal agreement for implementing Brexit, which was rejected by Parliament three times, leading to May announcing her resignation. During the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election, Sunak supported Johnson’s successful bid to succeed May as Conservative leader and prime minister, after which he appointed Sunak as Chief Secretary to the Treasury in July 2019.
After the 2019 general election, Johnson promoted Sunak to Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 2020 cabinet reshuffle after the resignation of Sajid Javid. During his time in the position, Sunak was prominent in the government’s financial response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, including the Coronavirus Job Retention and Eat Out to Help Out schemes. He was also involved in the government’s response to the ongoing cost of living crisis, energy supply crisis, and global energy crisis. Sunak resigned as chancellor in July 2022 and stood in the July-September Conservative Party leadership election to succeed Johnson, who resigned amid a government crisis. He had received the most votes in each of the series of MP votes, but lost the members’ vote to Liz Truss.
After spending the duration of Truss’s premiership on the backbenches, Sunak stood in the October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election to succeed Truss, who resigned amid another government crisis. He was elected unopposed as Conservative leader on 24 October 2022 and was appointed prime minister by King Charles III the following day. He is the first British Asian and Hindu to hold the office of prime minister. Sunak took office amid the cost of living crisis, and has authorized foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine in response to the Russian invasion of the country. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak)
WHAT SHOUD WE CELEBRATE?
The triumph of Hinduism? Certainly not!
Onward Hindu Soldiers’ march? The Modi-Sunak-Jugnauth triumvirate’s rise to world power and fame? You must be joking!
Let’s celebrate a certain UK political maturity. Let’s celebrate a dent in the armour of racism and some advance on the road to full meritocracy.
Let us rather hope that the ‘Kalkita’ (from Calcutta, now Kolkata) Hindus of Mauritius finally understand:
• that Mauritius is NOT ‘Chota Barat’ or Little India and will never be;
• that Mauritius, Rodrigues and Agalega are creole islands peopled by Hindo-Creoles, Afro-Creoles, Franco-Creoles, Islamo-Creoles and Sino-Creoles who have transformed the original flora and fauna for better or for worse;
• that Mauritius is NOT a vaish territory to be governed by some ‘lord-ordained’ Vaish-R&J-leader;
• that we are all immigrants here who are duty-bound to promote democracy and meritocracy;
• that genuine Mauritian leaders with foresight will eventually pave the way for a better green future;
• that in the Maritime Republic of Mauritius, 3 creole languages (Rodriguan, Mauritian and English) are the foundation stone on which a new national culture will grow.
We must learn to read the writing on the wall and prepare the ground for the new world to come.
And most important of all: Let us not lose our sense of proportion.

GIVE THE DEVIL HIS DUE
GIVE THE DEVIL HIS DUE
Mauritius has much to learn from Mr. Narendra Modi in the field of education, at least. His stand shows wisdom and pedagogical soundness and those eager to shout “Jai Hind” should rather think of adopting and adapting some of his views to solve some of our problems. Political acumen has guided the Indian PM on a more progressive course, putting a lot of water in his previous RSS wine.
Our national language, Mauritian, the mother tongue of over 90% of the population should be made the medium of instruction together with English, another creole language. Mr. Modi and I share similar views on this issue.
Jai Mauritius!

NEP 2020: PM Modi vouches for mother tongue as medium of instruction in schools.
Hindustan Times, New Delhi | By Amandeep Shukla
Sep 11, 2020, 12:58 PM IST
(abridged/adapted by Dev Virahsawmy)
The prime minister was speaking at ‘Shiksha Parv’, an event organised by the ministry of education, where he spoke extensively on the new National Education Policy (NEP). Strongly vouching for the use of mother tongue as the medium of instruction in schools, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that “people trapped in bookish knowledge” often fail to grasp that language is a way to communicate knowledge but not the entire knowledge in itself.
PM Modi said we fail to understand that language is a way to communicate knowledge but not the entire knowledge in itself. … Modi also sought to make it clear that while local languages were being promoted in the new National Education Policy (NEP), there was no bar at all on the teaching of English or any other language that can be helpful on the global stage…
“After the NEP came, there has been much discussion on what will be the language of instruction. Here we must understand one scientific fact that language is the medium of education, not entire education itself. People caught in too much of bookish knowledge often fail to grasp this distinction. Whatever language the child can learn easily in should be the medium of instruction,” he said.
He said it should be seen if the child can grasp what is being said in the class. And if she/he can, how effortlessly that is happening. It should not be that more effort of the child goes into just understanding the language rather than the subject, the prime minister said.
Top ranking countries, like Estonia, Ireland, Finland, Japan, Poland and South Korea in the global assessment, PISA, impart primary education in the mother tongue, he said.
The language which the children hear at home is the language in which they learn the fastest, Modi said. Learning in another language can be quite stressful for children, he added.
The prime minister said that in rural areas, parents cannot even remain connected to their child’s school education when the mother tongue is not the medium of instruction. So, till grade 5, the medium of instruction should be the mother tongue or the local language according to the NEP, he said.

A BIKINI CLICHÉ
(for Sheistah Bundhoo, a promising youth)
A friend, full of corny jokes but nevertheless witty at times, used to grumble because a bikini shows what you don’t want to see and hides what you want to see. But the word can be given a different metaphorical twist, albeit still sexist: the bikini reveals what is known but hides what should be known (in the biblical sense as well). A bikini cliché does just that. It is an expression which is used profusely to hide something essential.
In education the word ‘holistic’ is used without restraint or discernment. What is ‘holistic’? It refers to a method or approach which deals “with the whole of something or someone and not just a part” (Cambridge Dictionary: https://dictionary.cambridge.org/). Holistic education should aim at the development of body and mind, of social, political, cultural and spiritual life but it cannot not rule out “a sense of priority”. Proceeding step by step is vital.
1. It should ensure mastery in oracy, literacy and numeracy in at least one language, normally the learner’s mother tongue.
2. It should encourage the mastery of at least one second/foreign language. In the case of our Republic, it should be English.
3. A good knowledge of history is indispensable to know who we really are.
4. Some knowledge of science can help us understand the world we live in.
5. Some specific activities can help learners develop a healthy body, sensitivity and imagination.
To ensure a holistic approach, we need a team of specialist teachers to take care of different areas of knowledge and competence. It is a misnomer to call some teachers ‘holistic’ who, in the words of the Mauritius Institute of Education, are responsible for the teaching or monitoring of some specific subjects/activities (the non-core subjects, including Performing Arts, Health and Physical Education, Citizenship Education and Life Skills) (http://portal.mie.ac.mu/). Moreover, it is a serious error to consider a language which is the mother tongue (L1) of 90% of children and the second language (L2) of the remaining 10%, as an ethnic language belonging to the same category as the different ethnic languages of the Republic i.e., Hindi, Urdu, Mandarin Chinese etc.
Such an attitude can never generate a holistic approach.
What is the word holistic hiding?
• Rampant illiteracy;
• Inability to generate a national culture and identity;
• Ignorance of what we really are;
• Absence of a political will to build a genuine RAINBOW NATION.

Nou priye Soma e nou bwar soma
Me kan Mamon dir ki nou bizen fer,
Soma vinn tabou; larak ek taba
Pran plas kanabis dan tou minister.
Depi plis ki senkant an sa de la
Pe nouri lopital ek simitier
Mem ki nou kone ki gran frer ganja,
Anna SeBeDe, amenn lalimier.
Kifer nou prefer nouri konfizion,
Fer pa bon vinn bon, fer bon vinn pa bon?
Parski se Mamon ki tini baton.
Gran Kaptann Mamon ena so mision:
Fer so bann chokrra bwar wiski-glason
Letan ti poson mwazi dan prizon.
