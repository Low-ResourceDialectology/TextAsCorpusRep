 These are the main sounds which we use in Mauritian. Experienced , inventive  and creative teachers will 
certainly know how to use these quatrains  of almost nons ense poetry  (four -line poem s which rhyme and 
each line has 8 syllables which give it a re gular rhythm.) Teachers with musical expertise may put them to 
music. Just imagine how lively the class will be.  
The material may also be used for traditional classroo m work to teach spelling and pronunciation and 
develop memory power.  
 
PRONUNCIATION DIFFI CULTIES  
• Mauritian is a syllable -timed language. This means that all syllables in a word take the same 
amount of time to be produced whereas in a stress -timed language such as English, there is one 
syllable which is stressed. Look at the following examples:  ledikasion/edu ˈcation; benefis/ ˈbenefit; 
extra/ ˈextra; revize/re ˈvise  ... 
• In Mauritian , the sound s represented by <th> (/ θ/and /ð/) in English,  are not used and 
consequently  many Mauritians pronounce ‘this, that, those’ as ‘zis, zat, zoz’. There are a few other 
phonemes  (sounds) such as / ə/or /h/ which present some difficulty.  Teachers must be trained to 
cope with them.  
• We must also teach our pup ils long and short vowels as in the words <piss> and <peace>; <shit> 
and <sheet> etc.

 SAPIT 3  
WORD CLASS AND SYNTAX  
(KLAS MO EK SENTAX)  
NB: I have used the internet, where possible, to find some good examples of English usage.  
In both Mauritian and English, the shortest sentence is made up of TWO words: a noun and a verb.  
Zwazo sante. (Birds sing.) Lisien zape. ( Dogs bark.) Baba dormi. (Baby sleeps.)  
LET US LOOK AT NOUN S FIRST.  
For practical purposes we may divide nouns into 4 groups: common nouns, proper nouns, count noums and 
non-count nouns.  
 MORISIEN  ENGLISH  
Common nouns  
 
 latab, sez, lili, larmwar , bife, sak, liv, 
plim, kay e, lisien, sat, zwazo, fey, fler, 
pie ...  table, chair, bed, wardrobe, cupboard, 
bag, book, pen, exercise book, dog, cat, 
bird, leaf, flower, tree ...  
Proper nouns  Savitri, Suresh, Rober, Zayna, Moris, 
Porlwi ... Savitri, Suresh, Robert, Zaynah, 
Mauritius , Port Louis ...  
Count nouns  bann latab, bann sez, bann lili ... bann 
pie etc.  tables, chairs, beds ... birds, leaves, 
flowers, trees ...  
Non -count nouns  dilo, lafwa, disik , lakoler, lapeti, laenn ...  water, faith, sugar, anger, appetite, 
hatred ...  
 
In a two -word sentence, the noun is the subject (S) and the other word is a verb (V).  
A sentence is S+V: Lisien zape/Dogs bark.  
The sentence may also have 3 words:S+V+O (subject+verb+object): Suresh(S) manz(V) dipen(O). [Suresh(S) 
eats(V) bread(O).]  
GENDER, SINGULAR, PLURAL  
In French gender is grammaticalised whereas in Mauritian and English, gender is sex -determined.  
The following examples will illustrate my point.  
FRENCH  MAURITIAN  ENGLISH  
Un bel homme  
Une belle fille  
Un beau pays  
Des belles fleurs  
Des beau x arbres  Enn zoli zom  
Enn zoli tifi  
Enn zoli pei  
Bann zoli fler  
Bann zoli pie  A beautiful man  
A beautiful girl  
A beautiful country  
Beautiful flowers  
Beautiful trees  
 
In Mauritian, ‘ bann ’ is the plural marker: enn dimoun/bann dimoun; enn mous/bann mous etc . 
In English, ‘ s’ is affixed at the end of a noun to indicate the plural form: girl/girls; boy/b oys; priest/priests 
etc. For nouns ending in s, x, ch or sh, add ‘es’ at the end : bus/buses; box/boxes; church/churches; 
marsh/marshes . 
Singular nouns which end  in y, drop the ‘y’ which is replaced by ‘ies’: family/families; baby/babies etc.  
There are irre gular plural nouns:  
• woman /women  
• man /men  
• child /children  
• tooth /teeth  
18 
 • foot/feet 
• leaf/leaves  
• mouse /mice  
• goose /geese  
• half/halves  
• knife /knives  
• wife /wives  
• life/lives  
• loaf/loaves  
• potato /potatoes  
• tomato /tomatoes  
• cactus /cacti  
• fungus /fungi  
• oasis /oases  
• thesis /theses  
• crisis /crises  
• phenomenon /phenomena  
• criterion /criteria  
• datum /data  
Some nouns do not have a plural form: cattle, sheep, furniture, deer, aircraft etc.  
Teachers mus t devise exercises to help learners master the irregular plural forms.  
VERBS AND TENSES  
Mauritian verbs have only one form except for verbs ending in’e’ which may be dropped when followed by 
a direct object.  
Mo manze/I eat.  
Mo manz dipen/I eat bread.  
Frenc h verbs have dozens of forms  in writing. Take the present tense of ‘manger’. On its own, it has five 
forms: mange, manges, mangeons, mangez, mangent. English verbs have a minimum of three  forms and a 
maximum of five. Regular verbs have four  forms.

 TENSES AND ASPECTS  
In Mauritian and  English  there are 3 tenses: past, present and future.  
 MORISIEN  ENGLISH  
PREZAN/PRESENT  - aster  Mo zwe karom.  I play carrom.  (now)  
PASE/PAST  - yer Mo ti zwe karom.  I play ed carrom.  (yesterday)  
FITIR/FUTURE  - dime  Mo pou zwe karom.  I will play carrom.  (tomorrow)  
 
ASPE/ASPECT  
There are 2 aspects in both languages: progressive/progresif and perfective/perfektif.  
 MORISIEN  ENGLISH  
Prezan progresif  Mo pe zwe karom.  I am playing carrom.  
Prezan perfektif  Mo finn zwe karom.  I have played carrom.  
Pase progres if Mo ti pe zwe karom.  I was playing carrom.  
Pase perfektif  Mo ti finn zwe karom.  I had played carrom.

carrom.  
Fitir perfektif  Dime, sa ler la, mo pou finn ( fini) zwe 
karom.  Tomorrow, at this time, I will have  played 
carrom.  
N.B Progresif vedir ki aksion la pe kontinie; perfektif vedir ki aksion la finn akonpli /termine . 
VERB STATIF  
Dan morisien ena verb statif. So kontrer se verb dinamik ki exprim enn aksion.  Verb statif li dekri r enn 
sitiasion. Dan sa domenn la Angle enpe diferan parski li servi kopil (copula)  ki enn mo teknik pou oxilier.  
An Morisien : lesiel la ble; so labarb blan; fam la debrouyar; boug la dominer etc.  
An Angle : the sky is blue; his beard is white; the woman is resoursful; the bloke is a bully etc.  
Ki arive si nou met bann fraz la opase?  
lesiel la ti ble; so labarb ti blan; fam la ti debrouyar ...  
Ofitir: lesiel la pou ble; so labarb pou blan  ... 
An Angle kouma an Morisien , verb statif pa pr an aspe.  
Pa kapav dir: “Lesiel la pe/finn ble.” etc. Pa kapav dir: “The sky is being/has been blue.”  
GET SA TI KONVERSASION LA!  
- Kot twa?  
- Mo la.  
An Angle ek Franse nou gagn:  
- Where are you? O ù es tu?  
- I’m here. Je suis l à. 
Angle ek Franse servi kopil,  Morisien, non.  
MODALS  
As in English, modals are used in Mauritian:  
Mo va fer sa pou ed twa.  / I may do that to help you. (probability)  
Mo bizen  fer sa pou ed twa.  / I must do that to help you. (obligation)  
Mo kapav  fer sa pou ed twa.  / I can do this to he lp you. (possibility)  
 
Teachers will certainly have to use this knowledge  to work out oral and written exercises to help learners 
master the use of verbs, tenses and aspects .

Was blind but now I see  
 
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
37 
 How precious did that grace a ppear  
The hour I first believed  
 
Through many dangers, toils and s nares  
I have already come  
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far  
And grace will lead me home

CLEMENTINE  
In a cavern, in a canyon  
Excavating for a mine  
Lived a miner, forty -niner  
And his daughter, Clementine  
 
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling  
Oh, my darling Clementine  
You are lost and gone forever  
Dreadful sorry, Clementine  
 
Light she was and like a fairy  
And her s hoes were number nine  
Herring boxes without topses  
Sandals were for Clementine  
38 
  
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling  
Oh, my darling Clementine  
You are lost and gone forever  
Dreadful sorr y, Clementine  
 
Drove she ducklings to the water  
Every morning just at nine  
Hit her foot against a splinter  
Fell into the foaming brine  
 
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling  
Oh, my darling Clementine  
You are lost and gone forever  
Dreadful sorry, Clementine  
 
Ruby lips above the water  
Blowing bubbles soft and fine  
But alas, I was no swimme r 
So I lost my Clementine  
 
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling  
Oh, my darling Clementine  
You are lost and gone forever  
Dreadful sorry, Clementine  
 
Then the miner, forty -niner  
Soon began to peak and pine  
Thought he oughta join his daughter  
Now he's with his Clem entine  
 
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling  
Oh, my darling Clementine  
You are lost and gone forever  
Dreadful sorry, Clementine  
 
There's a churchyard on the hillside  
Where the flowe rs grow and twine  
There grow roses, 'mongst the posies  
Fertilized by Clementine  
 
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling  
Oh, my darling Clementine  
You are lost and gone forever  
Dreadful sorry, Clementine  
 
In my dreams she still doth haunt me  
Robed in garlands soake d in brine  
Though in life I used to hug her  
Now she's dead, I draw the line  
39 
  
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling  
Oh, my darling Clementine  
You are lost and gone forever  
Dreadful sorry, Clementine  
 
Now you scouts may learn the moral  
Of this little tale of mine  
Artificial respiration  
Would have saved my Clementine  
 
Oh, my darling, oh, my darl ing 
Oh, my darling Clementine  
You are lost and gone forever  
Dreadful sorry, Clementine  
 
How I missed her, how I missed her  
How I missed my Clementine  
Till I kissed her little sister  
And forgot my Clementine  
 
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling  
Oh, my darling Cl ementine  
You are lost and gone forever  
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

ZISTWAR EZOP/AESOP FABLES  
 
1. THE WOLF AND THE KID  
There was once a little kid whose growing horns made him think he was a grown -up Billy Goat and able to 
take care of himself. So , one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mo ther called, 
the kd paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the 
flock was  gone.  
He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind 
came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The kid shivered as he thought of the terrible 
wolf. Then he started wildly over the fi eld, bleating for his mother. But not half -way, near a clump of trees, 
there was the wolf!  
The kid knew there was little hope  for him.  
"Please, Mr. Wolf," he said trembling, "I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I 
want to da nce and be merry as long as I can."  
The wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and  the Kid leaped and 
frisked gaily.  
Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf's piping carr ied far. The 
shepherd dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the wolf sings before a feast, and in a 
moment , they were racing back to the pasture. The wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the 
dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his 
butcher's trade.  
Do not let anything turn you from y our purpose.

2. THE TORTOISE AND THE DUCKS  
 The tortoise, you know, carries his house on his bac k. No matter how hard he tries, he cannot leave home. 
They say that Jupiter punished him so, because he was such a lazy stay -at-home that he would not go to 
Jupiter's wedding, even when especially invited.  
After many years, tortoise began to wish he had go ne to that wedding. When he saw how gaily the birds 
flew about and how the hare and the chipmunk and all the other animals ran n imbly by, always eager to 
see everything there was to be seen, the tortoise felt very sad and discontented. He wanted to see the  
world too, and there he was with a house on his back and little short legs that could hardly drag him along.  
One day he met a p air of ducks and told them all his trouble.  
"We can help you to see the world," said the ducks. "Take hold of this stick with yo ur teeth and we will 
carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or you will be sorry."  
The tortoise was very glad indeed. He seized the stick firmly with his teeth, the two ducks took hold of it 
one at each end, and  away they sailed up toward the clouds.  
Just then a crow flew by. He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried:  
"This must surely be the King of tortoises!"  
"Why certainly —— " began the tortoise.  
But as he opened his mouth to say these foolish  words , he lost his hold on the stick, and down he fell to the 
ground, where he was dashed to pieces on a rock.  
Foolish curiosit y and vanity often lead to misfortune.  
2. ZISTWAR TORTI EK KANAR  
Enn torti, kouma nou kone, toultan pe sarye so lakaz lor so led o. Seye kouma li seye, zame li fouti kit so

3. THE YOUNG CR AB AND HIS MOTHER  
"Why in the world do you walk sideways like that?" said a Mother Crab to her son. "You should always walk 
straight forward with your toes turned out."  
46 
 "Show me how to walk, mother dear," answered the little crab obediently, "I want to lea rn." 
So, the old crab tried and tried to walk straight forward. But she could walk sideways only, like her son. And 
when she  wanted to turn her toes out , she tripped and fell on her nose.  
Do not tell others how to act unless you can set a good example.  
3. ZISTWAR ENN ZENN KRAB EK SO MAMA

4. THE FROGS AND THE OX  
An ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily into the water,  he crushed a young frog 
into the mud. The old frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become 
of him.  
"A great  big monster," said one of them, "stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet!"  
"Big, was he!" said th e old frog, puffing herself up. "Was he as big as this?"  
"Oh, much bigger!" they cried.  
The frog puffed up still more.  
"He could not have  been bigger than this," she said. But the little frogs all declared that the monster was 
much , much bigger and the old  frog kept puffing herself out more and more until, all at once, she burst.  
Do not attempt the impossible.  
4. ZISTWAR KRAPO EK BEF

5. THE DOG, THE COCK, AND THE FOX  
A dog and a cock, who were the best of friends, wished very much to see something of the world. So , they 
decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods. The two 
comrades travelled along in the very best of  spirits and without meeting any adventure to speak of.  
At nightfall the cock, looking for a place t o roost, as was his custom, spied nearby a hollow tree that he 
thought would do very nicely for a night's lodging. The dog could creep inside and the cock w ould fly up on 
one of the branches. So said, so done, and both slept very comfortably.  
With the firs t glimmer of dawn the cock awoke. For the moment he forgot just where he was. He thought 
he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to arouse t he household at daybreak. So , standing 
on tip -toes he flapped his wings and crowed lustily. But inst ead of awakening the farmer, he awakened a 
fox not far off in the wood. The fox immediately had rosy visions of a very delicious breakfast. Hurrying to 
the tree where the cock was roosting, he said very politely:  
"A hearty welcome to our woods, honored sir . I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here. I am quite 
sure we shall become the closest of friends."  
47 
 "I feel highly flattered, kind sir," replied the  cock slyly. "If you will please go around to the door of my house 
at the foot of the tree, my porte r will let you in."  
The hungry but unsuspecting fox, went around the tree as he was told, and in a twinkling the dog had 
seized him.  
Those who try to deceiv e may expect to be paid in their own coin.  
5. ZISTWAR LISIEN, KOK EK RENAR

6. BELLING THE CAT  
The mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the cat. At least they 
wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away . Indeed, 
something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hard ly dared stir from 
their dens by night or day.  
Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last , a very young Mouse got 
up and s aid: 
"I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful. All we have to do is t o hang a bell 
about the cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing , we will know immediately that our enemy is coming."  
All the mice were much surprised that  they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the 
rejoicing over their good fortu ne, an old mouse arose and said:  
"I will say that the plan of the young mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the 
cat?"  
It is one t hing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it.

7. THE EAGLE AND THE JACKDAW  
An eagle, swooping down on powerful wings, seized a lamb in her talons and made off with it to her nest. A 
jackdaw saw the deed, and his silly head was filled with the idea that he was big and strong enough to d o as 
the eagle had done. So , with much rustling of feathers and a fierce air, he came down swiftl y on the back of 
a large ram. But when he tried to rise again , he found that he could not get away, for his claws were 
tangled in the wool. And so far was he f rom carrying away the ram, that the ram hardly noticed he was 
there.  
The shepherd saw the flutter ing jackdaw and at once guessed what had happened. Running up, he caught 
the bird and clipped its wings. That evening he gave the jackdaw to his children.  
"Wha t a funny bird this is!" they said laughing, "what do you call it, father?"  
"That is a jackdaw, m y children. But if you should ask him, he would say he is an eagle."  
Do not let your vanity make you overestimate your powers.

8. THE BOY AND THE FILBERTS  
A boy was given permission to put his hand into a pitcher to get some filberts. But he took such a great 
fistful that he could not draw his hand out again. There he stood, unwilling to give up a single filbert and yet 
unable to get them all out at once. Vexed and disappointed he began to cry.  
"My boy," said his mother, "be satisfied with half the nuts  you have taken and you will easily get your hand 
out. Then perhaps you may have some more filbe rts some other time."

 9. HERCULES AND THE WAGONER  
A farmer was driving his wagon alo ng a miry country road after a heavy rain. The horses could hardly drag 
the load through the dee p mud, and at last came to a standstill when one of the wheels sank to the hub in a 
rut. 
The farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagon lookin g at it but without making the 
least effort to get it out of the rut. All he did was to curse hi s bad luck and call loudly on Hercules to come 
to his aid. Then, it is said, Hercules really did appear, saying:  
"Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and urge on your horses. Do you think you can move the wagon by 
simply looking at it and whining about it ? Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help 
yourself."  
And when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses, the wagon mov ed very 
readily, and soon the farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned.  
Self help is the best help.  
Heaven helps those who help themselves.

A frisky young Kid had been left by the herdsman on the thatched roof of a sheep shelter to keep  him out 
of harm's way. The kid was browsing near the edge of the roof, when he spied a wolf and began to jeer at 
him, making faces and abusing him to his heart's conten t. 
"I hear you," said the wolf, "and I haven't the least grudge against you for what yo u say or do. When you 
are up there , it is the roof that's talking, not you."

11. THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE  
A town mouse once visited a relative who liv ed in the country. For lunch the country mouse served wheat 
stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. The town mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a  
little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain that she a te the simple food only to 
be polite.  
After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the town mouse talked about her life in the city while 
the country mouse list ened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and 
comfo rt until morning. In her sleep the country mouse dreamed she was a town mouse with all the luxuries 
and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So , the next day when the town mouse asked 
the country mouse to go home with her to the cit y, she gladly said yes.  
When they reached the mansion in which the town mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room 
the leavings of a very fine banquet. Ther e were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses, indeed, 
50 
 the most tempting f oods that a mouse can imagine. But just as the country mouse was about to nibble a 
dainty bit of pastry, she heard a cat mew loudly and scratch at the door. In great fea r the mice scurried to a 
hiding place, where they lay quite still for a long time, hard ly daring to breathe. When at last they ventured 
back to the feast, the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table, followed by the 
house dog.  
The country mouse stopped in the town mouse's den only long enough to pick up her carpet ba g and 
umbrella.  
"You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not," she said as she hurried away, "but I prefer my plain 
food and simple life in the country with the p eace and security that go with it."  
Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty.

12. THE FOX AND THE GRAPES  
A fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a 
tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the fox' s mouth watered as he gazed longingly at 
them.  
The bunch hung from a high branch,  and the fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by 
a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. 
Again and again he tried, but in vain.  
Now he sat down and looked at the gr apes in disgust.  
"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth 
gaping for."  
And off he walked very, very scornful ly.

 13. THE BUNDLE OF STICKS  
A certain father had a family of sons, who wer e forever quarrelling among themselves. No words he could 
say did the least good, so he cast about in his mind for some very striking example that should make them 
see that di scord would lead them to misfortune.  
One day when the quarrelling had been much m ore violent than usual and each of the sons was moping in 
a surly manner, he asked one of them to bring him a bundle of sticks. Then handing the bundle to each of 
his sons in turn he told them to try to break it. But although each one tried his best, none was able to do so.  
The father then untied the bundle and gave the sticks to his sons to break one by one. This they did very 
easily.  
"My sons," said the father, "do you not se e how certain it is that if you agree with each other and help each 
other, it wil l be impossible for your enemies to injure you? But if you are divided among yourselves, you 
will be no stronger than a single stick in that bundle."

14. THE WOLF AND THE CRANE  
A wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in his  throat. He could get it neither 
up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a 
greedy Wolf.  
So away he hurried to the crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able t o 
reach the bone and pull it out.  
"I will reward you very handsomely, " said the wolf, "if you pull that bone out for me."  
The crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a wolf's throat. But she was 
grasping in nature, so she did w hat the wolf asked her to do.  
When the wolf felt that the bone was go ne, he started to walk away.  
"But what about my reward!" called the crane anxiously.  
"What!" snarled the wolf, whirling around. "Haven't you got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take yo ur head 
out of my mouth without snapping it off?"  
Expect no reward fo r serving the wicked.

15. THE ASS AND  HIS DRIVER  
An ass was being driven along a road leading down the mountain side, when he suddenly took it into his 
silly head to choose his own path. He could see his stall at the foot of  the mountain, and to him the quickest 
way down seemed to be over the  edge of the nearest cliff. Just as he was about to leap over, his master 
caught him by the tail and tried to pull him back, but the stubborn ass would not yield and pulled with all 
his m ight.  
"Very well," said his master, "go your way, you wilful beast, a nd see where it leads you."  
With that he let go, and the foolish ass tumbled head over heels down the mountain side.

A pair of oxen were drawing a heavily loaded wa gon along a miry country road. They had to use all their 
strength to pull the wagon, but they did not complain.  
The wheels of the wagon were of a different sort. Though the task they had to do was very light compared 
with that of the oxen, they creaked and  groaned at every turn. The poor oxen, pulling with all thei r might to 
draw the wagon through the deep mud, had their ears filled with the loud complaining of the wheels. And 
this, you may well know, made their work so much the harder to endure.  
"Silence!"  the oxen cried at last, out of patience. "What have you whe els to complain about so loudly? We

A lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paw s. A timid little mouse came upon him 
unexpectedly, and in h er fright and haste to get away, ran across the lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the 
lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill it.  
53 
 "Spare me!" begged the poor mouse. "Please let  me go and some day I will surely repay you."  
The lion was m uch amused to think that a mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let 
the mouse go.  
Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. 
Unable to free himself, he filled the forest  with his angry roaring. The mouse knew the voice and quickly 
found the lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until 
it parted, and soon the li on was free.  
"You laughed when I said I would repay you," sa id the mouse. "Now you see that even a mouse can help a

18. THE SHEPHERD BOY AND THE WOLF  
A shepherd boy tended his master's sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in 
the pasture v ery dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to hi s dog or play on his shepherd's pipe.  
One day as he sat watching the sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a 
wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself.  
His mast er had told him to call for help should a wolf attack the fl ock, and the villagers would drive it away. 
So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a wolf, he ran towards the village shouting 
at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf!"  
As he e xpected, the villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the 
pasture. But when they got there they found the boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played 
on them.  
A few days later the shepherd boy again s houted,  "Wolf! Wolf!" Again , the Villagers ran to help him, only to 
be laughed at again.  
Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the 
pasture, a wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon  the sh eep.  
In terror the Boy ran towards the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf!" But though the Villagers heard the cry, they 
did not run to help him as they had before. "He cannot fool us again," they said.  
The Wolf killed a great many of the boy's sheep and then sl ipped away into the forest.  
Liars are not believed even when they speak the truth.

20. THE PLANE TREE  
Two travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay 
looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a pla ne tree.  
"How useless is the plane!" said one of them. "It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the 
ground with leaves."  
"Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the plane tree. "You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say 
I am useless ! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!"  
Our best blessings are often the least appreciated.

21. THE FARMER AND THE STORK  
A stork of a very simple and trusting nature had been asked by a gay party of  cranes to visit a field that had 
been newly planted. But the party ended dismally with all the birds entangled in the meshes of the farmer's 
net. 
55 
 The stork begged the farmer to spare him.  
"Please let me go," he pleaded. "I belong to the stork family who y ou know are honest and birds of good 
character. Besides, I did not know the cranes were going to steal."  
"You may be a very good bird," answered the farmer, "but I caught you with the thieving cranes and you

22. THE SHEEP AND THE PIG  
One day a shepherd discovered a fat pig in the meadow where his sheep we re pastured.  He very quickly 
captured the porker, which squealed at the top of its voice the moment the shepherd laid his hands on it. 
You would have thought, to hear the loud squealing, that the pig was being cruelly hurt. But in spite of its 
squeals and struggles to  escape, the shepherd tucked his prize under his arm and started off to the 
butcher's in the market place.  
The sheep in the pasture were much astonished and amused at the pig's behavior, and followed the 
shepherd and his charge to the pasture g ate. 
"What m akes you squeal like that?" asked one of the sheep. "The shepherd often catches and carries off 
one of us. But we should feel very much ashamed to make such a terrible fuss about it like you do."  
"That is all very well," replied the pig, with a  squeal and a frantic kick. "When he catches you he is only after 
your wool. But he wants my bacon! gree -ee-ee!"  
It is easy to be brave when there is no danger.

23. THE TRAVELERS AND THE PURSE  
Two men were travelling in company along the road when one of  them picked up a well -filled purse.  
"How lucky I am!" he said. "I have found a purse. Judging by its weight it must be full of gold."  
"Do not say ' I have found a purse,'" said his companion. "Say rather ' we have found a purse' and 'how lucky 
we are.' Trav ellers ought to sh are alike the fortunes or misfortunes of the road."  
"No, no," replied the other angrily. " I found it and I am going to keep it."  
Just then they heard a shout of "Stop, thief!" and looking around, saw a mob of people armed with clubs 
comin g down the road.  
The man who had found the purse fell into a panic.  
"We are lost if they find the purse on us," he cried.  
"No, no," replied the other, "You would not say 'we' before, so now stick to your ' I'. Say ' I am lost.'"

One day as the lion walked proudly down a forest aisle, and the animals respectfully made way for him, an 
ass brayed a scorn ful remark as he passed.  
The lion felt a flash of anger. But when he turned his head and saw who had spoken, he walked quietly on.

25. TH E FROGS WHO WISHED FOR A KING  
The frogs were tired of governing themselves. They had so much freedom that it had spoiled them, and 
they did nothing but sit around croaking in a bored manner and wishing for a government that could  
entertain them with the po mp and display of royalty, and rule them in a way to make them know they were 
being ruled. No milk and water government for them, they declared. So they sent a petition to Jupiter 
asking for a king.  
Jupiter saw what simple and fo olish creatures they were, but to keep them quiet and make them think they 
had a king he threw down a huge log, which fell into the water with a great splash. The frogs hid 
themselves among the reeds and grasses, thinking the new king to be some fearful gi ant. But they soon 
discover ed how tame and peaceable King Log was. In a short time the younger frogs were using him for a 
diving platform, while the older frogs made him a meeting place, where they complained loudly to Jupiter 
about the government.  
To teac h the frogs a lesson the ru ler of the gods now sent a crane to be king of Frogland. The crane proved 
to be a very different sort of king from old King Log. He gobbled up the poor frogs right and left and they 
soon saw what fools they had been. In mournful croaks they begged Jupiter to take away the cruel tyrant 
before they should all be destroyed.  
"How now!" cried Jupiter "Are you not yet content? You have what you asked for and so you have only 
yourselves to blame for your misfortunes."  
Be sure you can bet ter your condition before y ou seek to change.

26. THE OWL AND THE GRASSHOPPER  
The owl always takes her sleep during the day. Then after  sundown, when the rosy lig ht fades from the sky 
and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow 
tree. Now her weird "hoo -hoo-hoo-oo-oo" echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the 
bugs and beetles, frogs and m ice she likes so well to eat.  
Now there was a certain old owl who had become very cross and hard to please as he grew older, 
especially if anything disturbed his daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as he dozed away in his 
den in the old oak tree, a g rasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old owl's 
head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window.  
"Get away from here, sir," she said to the grasshopper. "Have you no m anners? You should at least  respect 
my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!"  
But the grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the owl had to his 
place in the old oak. Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping  tune.  
The wise old owl kne w quite well that it would do no good to argue with the grasshopper, nor with 
anybody else for that matter. Besides, his eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit him to punish the 
grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside all hard words and spoke ve ry kindly to him.  
 "Well sir," he said, "if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing.  Now that I 
think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before he 
sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me. I know it will make you sing 
like Apollo himself."  
The fo olish grasshopper was taken  in by the owl's flattering words. Up he jumped to the owl's den, but as 
soon as he was near enough so the old owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him up.  
Flattery is not a proof of true admiration.  
Do not let  flattery throw you off you r guard against an enemy.

A wolf left his lair one evening in fine spirits and an excellent appetite. As he ran, the setting sun cast his 
shadow far out on the ground, and it looked as if the wo lf were a hundred times bigger than he really was.  
"Why," exclaimed the wolf proudly, "see how big I am! Fancy me running away from a puny lion! I'll show 
him who is fit to be king, he or I."  
Just then an immense shado w blotted him out entirely, and the ne xt instant a lion struck him down with a

28. THE OAK AND THE REEDS  
A giant oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender reeds. When the wind blew, the great oak 
stood proudly upright wi th its hundred arms uplifted to the sky. But the reeds bowed low in the wind and 
sang a sad and mournful song.  
"You have reason to complain," said the oak. "The slightest breeze that ruffles the surface of the water 
makes you bow your heads, while I, the m ighty oak, stand upright and firm before the howling tempest."  
"Do not worry about us," replied the reeds. "The winds do not harm us. We bow before them and so we do 
not break. You, in all your pride and strength, have  so far resisted their blows. But the end is coming."  
As the reeds spoke a great hurricane rushed out of the north. The oak stood proudly and fought against the 
storm, while the yielding reeds bowed low. The wind redoubled in fury, and all at once the grea t tree fell, 
torn up by the roots, and  lay among the pitying reeds.  
Better to yield when it is folly to resist, than to resist stubbornly and be destroyed.

 29. THE RAT AND THE ELEPH ANT  
A rat was traveling along the King's highway. He was a very proud rat, considering his small size and the bad 
reputation all rats have. As Mr. rat walked along —he kept mostly to the ditch —he noticed a great 
commotion up the road, and soon a grand proce ssion came in view. It was the King and his retinue.  
The King rode on a huge elephant adorned with the most gorgeous trappings. With the King in his luxurious 
howdah were the royal dog and cat. A great crowd of people followed the procession. They were so taken 
up with admiration of the elephant, that the rat was not noticed. His pride was hurt.  
"What fools!" he cried. "Look at me, and you will soon forget that clumsy elephant! Is it his great size that 
makes you r eyes pop out? Or is it his wrinkled hide? W hy, I have eyes and ears and as many legs as he! I am 
of just as much importance, and" — 
But just then the royal cat spied him, and the next instant, the rat knew he was not quite so important as an 
elephant.

Some boys were playing one day at the edge of a pond in which lived a family of frogs. The boys amused

The stones were flying thick and fast and the boys were enjoying themselves very much; but the poor frogs

In a spell of dry weather, when the birds could find very little to drink, a thirsty crow found a pitcher with a 
little water in it. But the pitcher was high an d had a narrow neck, and no matter how he tri ed, the crow 
could not reach the water. The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst.  
Then an idea came to him. Picking up some small pebbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. 
With each pebble the  water rose a little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink.

One bright day in late autumn a family of ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine, drying out the 
grain they had stor ed up during the summer, when a starving grasshopper, his fi ddle under his arm, came 
up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.  
"What!" cried the Ants in surprise, "haven't you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world 
were you doing all last sum mer?"  
"I didn't have time to store up any food," whined the grasshopper; "I was so busy making music that before 
I knew it the summer was gone."  
The ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust.  
"Making music, were you?" they cried. "Very well; now dance!" And  they turned their backs on the 
grasshopper and went on with  their work.

33. THE ASS CARRYING THE IMAGE  
A sacre d image was being carried to the temple. It was mounted on an ass adorned with garlands and 
gorgeous trappings, and a grand procession of priests and pages followed it through the streets. As the ass 
walked along, the people bowed their heads reverently or  fell on their knees, and the ass thought the 
honor was being paid to himself.  
With his head full of this foolish idea, he became so puffed up with pride and vanity that he halted and 
started to b ray loudly. But in the midst of his song, his driver guessed  what the ass had got into his head, 
and began to beat him unmercifully with a stick.  
"Go along with you, you stupid ass," he cried. "The honor is not meant for you but for the image you are 
carry ing."  
Do not try to take the credit to yourself that is due to others.

34. A RAVEN AND A SWAN  
A raven, which you know is black as coal, was envious of the swan, because her feathers were as white as 
the purest snow. The foolish bird got the idea that if he lived like the swan, swimming and diving all day 
long and eating the w eeds and plants that grow in the water, his feathers would turn white like the swan's.  
So he left his home in the woods and fields and flew down to live on the lakes and in the marshes. But 
though he washed and washed all day long, almost drowning himself at it, his feathers remained as black as 
ever. And as the water weeds he ate did not agree with him, he got thinner and thinner, and at last he died.  
A change of habits will not alter nature.

35. THE TWO GOATS  
Two goats, frisking gaily on the rocky steeps of a mountain valley, chanced to meet, o ne on each side of a 
deep chasm through which poured a mighty mountai n torrent. The trunk of a fallen tree formed the only 
means of crossing the chasm, and on this not even two squirrels could have passed each other in safety. 
The narrow path would have ma de the bravest tremble. Not so our goats. Their pride would not permi t 
either to stand aside for the other.  
One set her foot on the log. The other did likewise. In the middle they met horn to horn. Neither would give 
way, and so they both fell, to be swept  away by the roaring torrent below.  
It is better to yield than to com e to misfortune through stubbornness.

36. THE ASS AND THE LOAD OF SALT  
A merchant, driving his ass homeward from the seashore with a heavy load of salt , came to a river crossed 
by a shallow ford. They had crossed this ri ver many times before without accident, but this time the ass 
slipped and fell when halfway over. And when the Merchant at last got him to his feet, much of the salt had 
melted away. Deli ghted to find how much lighter his burden had become, the ass finishe d the journey very 
gaily.  
62 
 Next day the Merchant went for another load of salt. On the way home the ass, remembering what had 
happened at the ford, purposely let himself fall into the wate r, and again got rid of most of his burden.  
The angry merchant immedi ately turned about and drove the ass back to the seashore, where he loaded 
him with two great baskets of sponges. At the ford the ass again tumbled over; but when he had scrambled 
to his feet, it was a very disconsolate ass that dragged himself homeward un der a load ten times heavier 
than before.  
The same measures will not suit all circumstances.

37. THE LION AND THE GNAT  
"Away with you, vile insect!" said a lion angrily to a gnat that was buzzing around his head. But the gnat 
was not in the least disturbed.  
"Do you think," he said spitefully to  the lion, "that I am afraid of you because they call you king?"  
The next instant he flew at the lion and stung him sharply on the nose. Mad with rage, the lion struck 
fiercely at th e gnat, but only succeeded in tearing himself with his claws. Again and ag ain the gnat stung the 
Lion, who now was roaring terribly. At last, worn out with rage and covered with wounds that his own 
teeth and claws had made, the lion gave up the fight.  
The gnat buzzed away to tell the whole world about his victory, but instead he  flew straight into a spider's 
web. And there, he who had defeated the King of beasts came to a miserable end, the prey of a little 
spider.  
The least of our enemies is often the most  to be feared.  
Pride over a success should not throw us off our guard.

38. THE LEAP AT RHODES  
A certain man who visited foreign lands could talk of little when he returned to his home except the 
wonderful ad ventures he had met with and the great deeds he had done abroad.  
63 
 One of th e feats he told about was a leap he had made in a city called Rhodes. That leap was so great, he 
said, that no other man could leap anywhere near the distance. A great many persons i n Rhodes had seen 
him do it and would prove that what he told was true.  
"No need of witnesses," said one of the hearers. "Suppose this city is Rhodes. Now show us how far you can 
jump."

A cock was busily scratching and scraping about to find something to eat for himself and his family, when 
he happened to turn up a precious  jewel that had been lost by its owner.  
"Aha!" said the cock. "No doubt yo u are very costly and he who lost you would give a great deal to find you. 
But as for me, I would choose a single grain of barleycorn before all the jewels in the world."

40. THE MONKEY AND THE CAMEL  
At a great celebratio n in honor of King Lion, the monkey was asked to dance for the company. His dancing 
was very clever indeed, and the animals were all highly pleased with his grace and lightness.  
The praise that was showered on the monkey made the camel envious. He was very  sure that he could 
dance quite as well as the monkey, if not better, so he pushed hi s way into the crowd that was gathered 
around the monkey, and rising on his hind legs, began to dance. But the big hulking camel made himself 
very ridiculous as he kicked out his knotty legs and twisted his long clumsy neck. Besides, the animals found 
it hard to keep their toes from under his heavy hoofs.  
At last, when one of his huge feet came within an inch of King Lion's nose, the animals were so disgusted 
that they set upon the camel in a rage and drove him out into the desert.  
Shortly afterward, refres hments, consisting mostly of camel's hump and ribs, were served to the company.

A wild boar was sharpening his tusks busily against the stump of a tree, when a fox happened by. Now the 
fox was always looking for a chance to make fun of his neighbour s. So he made a great show of looking 
anxiously about, as if in fear of some hidden e nemy. But the boar kept right on with his work.  
"Why are you doing that?" asked the fox at last with a grin. "There isn't any danger that I can see."  
"True enough," replie d the boar, "but when danger does come there will not be time for such work as this. 
My weapons will have to be ready for use then, or I shall suffer for it."

42. THE ASS, THE FOX AND THE LION  
An ass and a fox had become close comrades, and were constantly in each other's company. While the ass 
cropped a fresh bit of greens, the fox would devour a chicken from the neighboring farmyard or a bit of 
cheese filched from the dairy. One day the pair unexpectedly met a lion. The ass was very much frightened, 
but the fox calmed his fears.  
"I will talk to him," he said.  
So the fox walked boldly up to the lion.  
"Your highness," he said in an undertone, so the  ass could not hear him, "I've got a fine scheme in my head. 
If you promise not to hurt me, I will lead that foolish creature yonder into a pit where he can't get out, a nd 
you can feast at your pleasure."  
The lion agreed and the fox returned to the ass.  
"I made him promise not to hurt us," said the fox. "But come, I know a good place to hide till he is gone."  
So the fox led the ass into a deep pit. But when the lion saw t hat the ass was his for the taking, he first of all 
struck down the traitor fox.

43. THE BIRDS, THE BEASTS, AND THE BAT  
The birds  and the beasts declared war against each other. No compromise was possible, and so they went 
at it tooth and claw. It is said the quarrel grew out of the persecution the race of geese suffered at the 
65 
 teeth of the fox family. The beasts, too, had cause for  fight. The eagle was constantly pouncing on the hare, 
and the owl dined daily on mice.  
It was a terrible battle. Many a hare and many a mouse died. Chickens and geese  fell by the score —and the 
victor always stopped for a feast.  
Now the bat family had not openly joined either side. They were a very politic race. So when they saw the 
birds getting the better of it, they were birds for all there was in it. But when the ti de of battle turned, they 
immediately sided with the beasts.  
When the battle was over, th e conduct of the bats was discussed at the peace conference. Such deceit was 
unpardonable, and birds and beasts made common cause to drive out the bats. And since then  the bat 
family hides in dark towers and deserted ruins, flying out only in the night.  
The deceitful have no friends.

Just as a great bear rushed  to seize a stray kid, a lion leaped from another direction upon the same prey. 
The two f ought furiously for the prize until they had received so many wounds that both sank down unable 
to continue the battle.  
Just then a fox dashed up, and seizing the kid,  made off with it as fast as he could go, while the lion and the 
bear looked on in helple ss rage.

45. THE WOLF AND THE LAMB  
A stray lamb stood drinking early one morning on the bank of a woodland stream. That very same morning 
a hungry wolf came by farther up the stream, hunting for some thing to eat. He soon got his eyes on the 
lamb. As a rule , Mr. Wolf snapped up such delicious morsels without making any bones about it, but this 
lamb looked so very helpless and innocent that the wolf felt he ought to have some kind of an excuse for 
takin g its life.  
"How dare you paddle around in my stream and stir up all the mud!" he shouted fier cely. "You deserve to 
be punished severely for your rashness!"  
"But, your highness," replied the trembling lamb, "do not be angry! I cannot possibly muddy the wat er you 
are drinking up there. Remember, you are upstream and I am downstream."  
"You do muddy i t!" retorted the wolf savagely. "And besides, I have heard that you told lies about me last 
year!"  
66 
 "How could I have done so?" pleaded the lamb. "I wasn't born un til this year."  
"If it wasn't you, it was your brother!"  
"I have no brothers."  
"Well, then," s narled the wolf, "It was someone in your family anyway. But no matter who it was, I do not 
intend to be talked out of my breakfast."  
And without more words the wo lf seized the poor lamb and carried it off to the forest.  
The tyrant can always find an excuse  for his tyranny.

A wolf had been hurt in a fight with a bear. He was unable to move and could not satisfy his hunger and 
thirst. A sheep passed by near his hiding pla ce, and the wolf called to him.  
"Please fetch me a drink of water," he begged, "that might giv e me strength enough so I can get me some 
solid food."  
"Solid food!" said the sheep. "That means me, I suppose. If I should bring you a drink, it would only serve to

Hares, as you know, are very timid. The least shadow, sends them scurrying in fright to a hiding place. Once 
they decided to die rather than live in such  misery. But while they were debating how best to meet death, 
they thought they heard a noise and in a flash were scampering off to the warren. On the way th ey passed 
a pond where a family of frogs was sitting among the reeds on the bank. In an instant the  startled frogs 
were seeking safety in the mud.

48. THE FOX AND THE STORK  
The fox one day thought of a plan to amuse himself at the expense of the stork, at whose odd appearance 
he was always laughing.  
"You must come and dine with me today," he said to th e stork, smiling to himself at the trick he was going 
to play. The stork gladly accepted the invita tion and arrived in good time and with a very good appetite.  
For dinner the fox served soup. But it was set out in a very shallow dish, and all the stork cou ld do was to 
wet the very tip of his bill. Not a drop of soup could he get. But the fox lapped it u p easily, and, to increase 
the disappointment of the stork, made a great show of enjoyment.  
 The hungry stork was much displeased at the trick, but he was a calm, even -tempered fellow and saw no 
good in flying into a rage. Instead, not long afterward, he invited the fox to dine with him in turn. The fox 
arrived promptly at the time that had been set, and the stork served a fish dinner that had a v ery appetizing 
smell. But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck. The stork could easily get at the food with his 
long bill, but all the fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar, and s niff at the delicious odour. And 
when the Fox lost h is temper, the Stork said calmly: “ Do not play tricks on your neighbours unless you can 
stand the same treatment yourself.”

49. THE TRAVELERS AND THE SEA  
Two travelers were walking along the seashore. Far out they saw something riding on the waves.  
"Look," said one, "a great ship rides in from distant land s, bearing rich treasures!"  
The object they saw came ever nearer the shore.  
"No," said the other, "that is not a treasure ship. That is some fisherman's skiff, with the day's catch of 
savoury fish."  
Still nearer came the object. The waves washed it up on s hore.

 "It is a chest of gold lost from some wreck," they cried. Both travelers rushed to the beach, but there they 
found nothing but a water -soaked log.

50. THE WOLF AND THE LION  
A wolf had stolen a lamb and was carrying it off to his lair to eat it. But his plans were very much changed 
when he met a lion, who, without making any excuses, took the Lamb away from him.  
The wolf made off to a safe distance, and then said in a much -injured tone:  
"You have no right to take my property like that!"  
The lion looked back, but as the wolf was too far away to be taught a lesson without to o much 
inconvenience, he said:  
"Your property? Did you buy it, or did the Shepherd make you a gift of it? Pray tell me, how did you get it?"  
What is evil won is evil lost.

51. THE STAG AND HIS REFLECTION  
A stag, drinking fro m a crystal spring, saw himself mirrored in the clear wate r. He greatly admired the 
graceful arch of his antlers, but he was very much ashamed of his spindling legs.  
"How can it be," he sighed, "that I should be cursed with such legs when I have so magnifi cent a crown."  
At that moment he scented a panther and in an instant was bounding away through the forest. But as he 
ran his wide -spreading antlers caught in the branches of the trees, and soon the Panther overtook him. 
Then the stag perceived that the legs of which he was so ashamed would have saved him had it n ot been 
for the useless ornaments on his head.  
We often make much of the ornamental and despise the useful.

 52. THE PEACOCK  
The peacock, they say, did not at first have the beautiful feathers in which he now takes so much p ride. 
These, Juno, whose favorite he was, granted to him one day when he begged her for a train of feathers to 
distinguish him from the other birds. Then, decked in his finery, gleaming with emerald, gold, purple, and 
azure, he strutted proudly among the b irds. All regarded him with envy. Even the most beautiful phe asant 
could see that his beauty was surpassed.  
Presently the peacock saw an eagle soaring high up in the blue sky and felt a desire to fly, as he had been 
accustomed to do. Lifting his wings , he tried to rise from the ground. But the weight of his magnifice nt train 
held him down. Instead of flying up to greet the first rays of the morning sun or to bathe in the rosy light 
among the floating clouds at sunset, he would have to walk the ground more en cumbered and oppressed 
than any common barnyard fowl.  
Do not sacrifice your freedom for the sake of pomp and show.

53. THE MICE AND THE WEASELS  
The weasels and t he mice were always up in arms against each other. In every b attle the weasels carried off 
the victory, as well as a large number of the mice, which they ate for dinner next day. In despair the mice 
called a council, and there it was decided that the mouse  army was always beaten because it had no 
leaders. So , a large  number of generals and commanders were appointed from among the most eminent 
mice.  
To distinguish themselves from the soldiers in the ranks, the new leaders proudly bound on their heads 
lofty cr ests and ornaments of feathers or straw. Then after long prep aration of the mouse army in all the 
arts of war, they sent a challenge to the weasels.  
The weasels accepted the challenge with eagerness, for they were always ready for a fight when a meal 
was i n sight. They immediately attacked the mouse army in large nu mbers. Soon the mouse line gave way 
before the attack and the whole army fled for cover. The privates easily slipped into their holes, but the 
mouse leaders could not squeeze through the narrow o penings because of their head -dresses. Not one 
escaped the te eth of the hungry weasels.  
Greatness has its penalties.

 54. THE WOLF AND THE LEAN DOG  
A wolf prowling near a village one evening met a dog. It happened to be a very lean and bony dog, and 
Master Wolf would have turned up his nose at such meager fare had he not bee n more hungry than usual. 
So he began to edge towards the dog , while the dog backed away.  
"Let me remind your lordship," said the dog, his words interrupted now and then as he dodged a snap of 
the wolf's teeth, "how unpleasant it would be to eat me now. Lo ok at my ribs. I am nothing but skin and 
bone. But let me tel l you something in private. In a few days my master will give a wedding feast for his 
only daughter. You can guess how fine and fat I will grow on the scraps from the table. Then is the time to 
eat me."  
The wolf could not help thinking how nice it would be  to have a fine fat dog to eat instead of the scrawny 
object before him. So he went away pulling in his belt and promising to return.  
Some days later the wolf came back for the promised feast. He found the dog in his master's yard, and 
asked him to come ou t and be eaten.  
"Sir," said the dog, with a grin, "I shall be delighted to have you eat me. I'll be out as soon as the porter 
opens the door."  
But the "porter" was a huge dog whom the wo lf knew by painful experience to be very unkind toward 
wolves. So he d ecided not to wait and made off as fast as his legs could carry him.  
Do not depend on the promises of those whose interest it is to deceive you.  
Take what you can get when you can get it .

A very  young fox, who had never before seen a lion, happened to meet one in the forest. A single look was 
enough to send the fox off at top speed for the nearest hiding place.  
The second time the fox saw the lion he stopped behind a tree to look at him a moment before slinking 
away. But the third time, the fox went boldly up to th e lion and, without turning a hair, said, "Hello, there,

 56. THE LION AND THE ASS  
A lion and an ass agreed to go hunting together. In their search for game the hunters saw a number of wild 
goats run into a cave, and laid plans to catch them. The ass was to go into the cave and drive the goats out, 
while the lion would stand at the entrance to strike them down.  
The plan worked beautifully. The ass made such a frightful din in the cave, k icking and braying with all his 
might, that the goats came running out in a panic of fear, only to fall victim to the lion.  
The ass came proudly out of the cave.  
"Did you see how I made them run?" he said.  
"Yes, indeed," answered the lion, "and if I had not known you and your kind I should certainly have run, 
too."

A dog had learned to  carry his master's dinner to him every day. He was very faithful to his duty, though the 
smell of the good things in the basket tempted him.  
The dogs in the neighborhood noticed  him carrying the basket and soon discovered what was in it. They 
made several  attempts to steal it from him. But he always guarded it faithfully.  
Then one day all the dogs in the neighborhood got together and met him on his way with the basket. The 
dog tr ied to run away from them. But at last he stopped to argue.  
That was his mista ke. They soon made him feel so ridiculous that he dropped the basket and seized a large 
piece of roast meat intended for his master's dinner.  
"Very well," he said, "you divide th e rest."

A jackdaw chanced to fly over the garden of the king's palace. There he saw with much wonder and e nvy a 
flock of royal peacocks in all the glory of their splendid plumage.  
Now the black jackdaw was not a very handsome bird, nor very refined in manner. Yet he imagined that all 
he needed to make himself fit for the society of the peacocks was a dress lik e theirs. So he picked up some 
castoff feathers of the peacocks and stuck them  among his own black plumes.  
Dressed in his borrowed finery he strutted loftily among the birds of his own kind. Then he flew down into 
the garden among the peacocks. But they so on saw who he was. Angry at the cheat, they flew at him, 
plucking away the bor rowed feathers and also some of his own.

  The poor jackdaw return ed sadly to his former companions. There another unpleasant surprise awaited

59. THE MONKEY AND THE DOLPHIN  
It happened once upon a time that a certain Greek ship bound for Athens was wrecked off the coast close 
to Piraeus, the port of Ath ens. Had it not been for the dolphins, who at that time were very friendly 
towar ds mankind and especially towards Athenians, all would have perished. But the dolphins took the 
shipwrecked people on their backs and swam with them to shore.  
Now it was the cu stom among the Greeks to take their pet monkeys and dogs with them whenever they  
went on a voyage. So when one of the dolphins saw a monkey struggling in the water, he thought it was a 
man, and made the monkey climb up on his back. Then off he swam with hi m towards the shore.  
The Monkey sat up, grave and dignified, on the dolphin's ba ck. 
"You are a citizen of illustrious Athens, are you not?" asked the dolphin politely.  
"Yes," answered the monkey, proudly. "My family is one of the noblest in the city."  
"Ind eed," said the dolphin. "Then of course you often visit Piraeus."  
"Yes, yes," re plied the monkey. "Indeed, I do. I am with him constantly. Piraeus is my very best friend."  
This answer took the dolphin by surprise, and, turning his head, he now saw what it was he was carrying. 
Without more ado, he dived and left the foolish Monkey to t ake care of himself, while he swam off in 
search of some human being to save.

 60. THE WOLF AND THE ASS  
An ass was feeding in a pasture near a wood w hen he saw a wolf lurking in the shadows along the hedge. 
He easily guessed what  the wolf had in mind, and thought of a plan to save himself. So he pretended he 
was lame, and began to hobble painfully.  
When the wolf came up, he asked the ass what had made him lame, and the ass replied that he had 
stepped on a sharp thorn.  
"Please pull  it out," he pleaded, groaning as if in pain. "If you do not, it might stick in your throat when you 
eat me."  
The wolf saw the wisdom of the advice, for he wanted to enjoy  his meal without any danger of choking. So 
the ass lifted up his foot and the wolf b egan to search very closely and carefully for the thorn.  
Just then the ass kicked out with all his might, tumbling the Wolf a dozen paces away. And while the wolf 
was gett ing very slowly and painfully to his feet, the ass galloped away in safety.  
"Serves m e right," growled the wolf as he crept into the bushes. "I'm a butcher by trade, not a doctor."

61. THE MONKEY AND  THE CAT  
Once upon a time a cat and a monkey lived as pets in the same house. They were great friends and were 
constantly in all sorts of mischief together. What they seem ed to think of more than anything else was to 
get something to eat, and it did not ma tter much to them how they got it.  
One day they were sitting by the fire, watching some chestnuts roasting on the hearth. How to get them 
was the question.  
"I would gladly  get them," said the cunning monkey, "but you are much more skilful at such things th an I 
am. Pull them out and I'll divide them between us."  
Pussy stretched out her paw very carefully, pushed aside some of the cinders, and drew back her paw very 
quickly. Then she tried it again, this time pulling a chestnut half out of the fire. A third t ime and she drew 
out the chestnut. This performance she went through several times, each time singeing her paw severely. 
As fast as she pulled the chestnuts out of the fir e, the monkey ate them up.  
Now the master came in, and away scampered the rascals, Mi stress Cat with a burnt paw and no chestnuts. 
From that time on, they say, she contented herself with mice and rats and had little to do with Sir Monkey.

62. THE DOGS AND THE FOX  
Some dogs found the skin of a lion and furiously began to tear it  with their teeth. A fox chanced to see 
them and laughed scornfully.  
"If that lion had been aliv e," he said, "it would have been a very different story. He would have made you 
feel how much sharper his claws are than your teeth."  
It is easy and also contem ptible to kick a man that is down.

63. THE DOGS AND THE HIDES  
Some hungry dogs saw a number of hides at the bottom of a stream where the tanner had put them  to 
soak. A fine hide makes an excellent meal for a hungry dog, but the water was deep and the D ogs could not 
reach the hides from the bank. So they held a council and decided that the very best thing to do was to 
drink up the river.  
All fell to lapping up  the water as fast as they could. But though they drank and drank until, one after 
another, all of them had burst with drinking, still, for all their effort, the water in the river remained as high 
as ever.  
Do not try to do impossible things.

 64. THE RABBIT, THE WEASEL, AND THE CAT  
A rabbit left his home one day for a dinner of clover . But he forgot to latch the door of his house and while 
he was gone a weasel walked in and calmly made himself at home. When the rabbit returned, there was 
the weasel's nose sticking out of the rabbit's own doorway, sniffing the fine air.  
The rabbit was q uite angry —for a rabbit —, and requested the weasel to move out. But the weasel was 
perfectly content. He was settled down for good.  
A wise old cat heard the dispute and offered to settle it.  
"Come close to me," said the cat, "I am very deaf. Put your mouth s close to my ears while you tell me the 
facts."  
The unsuspecting pair did as they were told and in an instant the Cat had them both under her claws. No 
one could deny that the dispute had been definitely settled.

65. THE BEAR AND THE BEES  
A bear roaming the woods in search of berries came across a fallen tree in which a swarm of bees had 
stored their honey. The bear began to nose around the log very carefully to find out if the bees were at 
home. Jus t then one of the swarm came home from the clover field with a load of sweets. Guessing what 
the be ar was after, the bee flew at him, stung him sharply and then disappeared into the hollow log.  
The bear lost his temper in an instant, and sprang upon the lo g tooth and claw, to destroy the nest. But this 
only brought out the whole swarm. The poor bear had  to take to his heels, and he was able to save himself 
only by diving into a pool of water.  
It is wiser to bear a single injury in silence than to provoke a thousand by flying into a rage.

66. THE FOX AND THE LEOPARD  
A fox and a leopard, resting lazily after a generous dinner, amused themselves by disputing about thei r 
good looks. The leopard was very proud of his glossy, spotted coat and made disdainful remarks ab out the 
fox, whose appearance he declared was quite ordinary.  
76 
 The fox prided himself on his fine bushy tail with its tip of white, but he was wise enough to see that he 
could not rival the leopard in looks. Still he kept up a flow of sarcastic talk, just t o exercise his wits and to 
have the fun of disputing. The leopard was about to lose his temper when the fox got up, yawning lazily.  
"You may have a very smar t coat," he said, "but you would be a great deal better off if you had a little more 
smartness insi de your head and less on your ribs, the way I am. That's what I call real beauty."  
A fine coat is not always an indication of an attractive mind.

67. THE HERON  
A heron was walking sedately along the bank of a stream, his ey es on the clear water, and his long neck and 
pointed bill ready to snap up a likely morsel for his breakfast. The clear water swarmed with fish, but 
Master  Heron was hard to please that morning.  
"No small fry for me," he said. "Such scanty fare is not fit for a heron."  
Now a fine young perch swam near.  
"No indeed," said the heron. "I wouldn't even trouble to open my beak for anything like that!"  
As the sun r ose, the fish left the shallow water near the shore and swam below into the cool depths toward 
the mi ddle. The heron saw no more fish, and very glad was he at last to breakfast on a tiny snail.  
Do not be too hard to suit or you may have to be content with the worst or with nothing at all.

68. THE COCK AND THE FOX  
One bright evening as the sun was sinking on a glorious world a wise old cock flew into a tree to roost. 
Before he composed himself to rest, he flap ped his wings three times and crowed loudly. But just as he was 
about to put his head under his wing, his beady eyes caught a flash of red and a glimpse of  a long pointed 
nose, and there just below him stood Master Fox.  
"Have you heard the wonderful news?"  cried the fox in a very joyful and excited manner.  
"What news?" asked the cock very calmly . But he had a queer, fluttery feeling inside him, for, you know, he 
was very much afraid of the fox.  
77 
 "Your family and mine and all other animals have agreed to forg et their differences and live in peace and 
friendship from now on forever. Just think of it! I simply cannot wait to embrace you! Do come down, dear 
friend, and let us celebrate the joyful event."  
"How grand!" said the cock. "I certainly am delighted at th e news." But he spoke in an absent way, and 
stretching up on tiptoes, seemed to be looking at something afar off.  
"What is it you see?" asked the fox a  little anxiously.  
"Why, it looks to me like a couple of dogs coming this way. They must have heard the g ood news and —" 
But the fox did not wait to hear more. Off he started on a run.  
"Wait," cried the cock. "Why do you run? The dogs are friends of yours n ow!"  
"Yes," answered the Fox. "But they might not have heard the news. Besides, I have a very important e rrand 
that I had almost forgotten about."  
The cock smiled as he buried his head in his feathers and went to sleep, for he had succeeded in outwitting 
a very crafty enemy.  
The trickster is easily tricked.

69. THE DOG IN THE MANGER  
A dog asleep in a manger filled with hay, was awakened by the cattle, which came in tired and hung ry from 
working in the field. But the dog would not let them get near the manger, and snarled and snapped as if it 
were filled with the best of meat and bones, all for himself.  
The cattle looked at the dog in disgust. "How selfish he is!" said one. "He can not eat the hay and yet he will 
not let us eat it who are so hungry for it!"  
Now the farmer came in. When he saw ho w the dog was acting, he seized a stick and drove him out of the 
stable with many a blow for his selfish behavior.  
Do not grudge others what you cannot enjoy yourself.

A hungry wolf spied a goat browsing at the top of a steep cliff where he could  not possibly get at her.  
"That is a very dangerous place for you," he called out, pretending to be very anxious ab out the goat's 
safety. "What if you should fall! Please listen to me and come down! Here you can get all you want of the 
finest, tenderest gr ass in the country."  
The goat looked over the edge of the cliff.  
"How very, very anxious you are about me," she sai d, "and how generous you are with your grass! But I 
know you! It's your own  appetite you are thinking of, not mine!"

71. THE ASS AND THE GRASSHOPPERS  
One day as an ass was walking in the pasture, he found som e grasshoppers chirping merrily in a grassy 
corner of the field.  
He listened with a great deal of admiration to the song of the grasshoppers. It was such a joyful song that 
his pleasure -loving heart was fil led with a wish to sing as they did.  
"What is it?"  he asked very respectfully, "that has given you such beautiful voices? Is there any special food 
you eat, or is it some divine nectar that makes you sing so wonderfully?"  
"Yes," said the grasshoppers, who were very fond of a joke; "it is the dew we drink!  Try some and see."  
So thereafter the ass would eat nothing and drink nothing but dew.  
Naturally, the poor foolish ass soon died.

 A fox fell into a well, and though it was not very deep, he found that he could not get out again. After he 
had been in the well a long time, a thirsty goat came by. The goat thought the Fox had gone down to drink, 
and so he asked if the  water was good.  
"The finest in the whole country," said the crafty fox, "jump in and try it. There is more than enough for 
both of us."  
The thirsty goat immediately jumped in and began to drink. The fox just as quickly jumped on the Goat's 
back and leaped  from the tip of the goat's horns out of the well.  
The fo olish goat now saw what a plight he had got into, and begged the fox to help him out. But the fox was 
already on his way to the woods.  
"If you had as much sense as you have beard, old fellow," he sai d as he ran, "you would have been more

74. THE CAT, THE COCK, AND THE YOUNG MOUSE  
A very young mouse, who had nev er seen anything of the world, almost came to grief the very first time he 
ventured out. And this is the story he told his mother about his adventures.  
"I was strolling along very peaceably when,  just as I turned the corner into the next yard, I saw two st range 
creatures. One of them had a very kind and gracious look, but the other was the most fearful monster you 
can imagine. You should have seen him.  
"On top of his head and in front of his neck hung pieces of raw red meat. He walked about restlessly, 
tearing up the ground with his toes, and beating his arms savagely against his sides. The moment he caught 
sight of me he opened his pointed mouth as if to swallow me, and then he let out a piercing roar that 
frightened me almost to death."  
Can you guess who i t was that our young mouse was trying to describe to his mother? It was nobody but 
the barnyard cock and the first one the little mouse had ever seen.  
80 
 "If it had not been for that terrible monste r," the mouse went on, "I should have made the acquaintance o f 
the pretty creature, who looked so good and gentle. He had thick, velvety fur, a meek face, and a look that 
was very modest, though his eyes were bright and shining. As he looked at me he waved  his fine long tail 
and smiled.  
"I am sure he was just about to speak to me when the monster I have told you about let out a screaming 
yell, and I ran for my life."  
"My son," said the mother mouse, "that gentle creature you saw was none other than the cat.  Under his 
kindly appearance, he bears a grudge against every  one of us. The other was nothing but a bird who 
wouldn't harm you in the least. As for the cat, he eats us. So be thankful, my child, that you escaped with 
your life, and, as long as you live, n ever judge people by their looks."

A wolf had been prowling around a flock of sheep for a long time, and the shepherd watched very anxiously 
to prevent him from carrying off a lamb. But the wolf did not try to do any harm. Instead he seemed to be 
help ing the shepherd take care of the Sheep. At last the shepherd got  so used to seeing the wolf about that 
he forgot how wicked he could be.  
One day he even went so far as to leave his flock in the wolf's care while he went on an errand. But when

A peacock, puffed  up with vanity, met a crane one day, and to impress him spread his gorgeous tail in the

 "Look," he said. "What have you to compare with this? I am dressed in all the glory of the rainbo w, while

The crane spread his br oad wings and flew up towards the sun.  
"Follow me if you can," he said. But the peacock stood where he was among the birds of the barnyard, 
while the crane soared in freedom far up into the b lue sky.

77. THE FARMER AND THE CRANES  
Some cranes saw a farmer ploughing a large field. When the work of ploughing was done, they patiently 
watched him sow the seed. It was their feast, they thought.  
So, as soon as the farmer had finished planting and had gone home, down they flew to the field, and began 
to eat as fas t as they could.  
The farmer, of course, knew the cranes and their ways. He ha d had experience with such birds before. He 
soon returned to the field with a sling. But he did not bring any stones with him. He expected to scare the 
Cranes just by swinging the  sling in the air, and shouting loudly at them.  
At first the cranes flew away  in great terror. But they soon began to see that none of them ever got hurt. 
They did not even hear the noise of stones whizzing through the air, and as for words, they would kil l 
nobody. At last they paid no attention whatever to the farmer.  
The farmer s aw that he would have to take other measures. He wanted to save at least some of his grain. 
So he loaded his sling with stones and killed several of the cranes. This had the effec t the farmer wanted, 
for from that day the Cranes visited his field no more.  
Bluff and threatening words are of little value with rascals.  
Bluff is no proof that hard fists are lacking.

78. THE FARMER AND HIS SONS  
A rich old farmer, who felt that he had not many more days to live, called  his sons to his bedside.  
82 
 "My sons," he said, "heed what I have to say to you . Do not on any account part with the estate that has 
belonged to our family for so many generations. Somewhere on it is hidden a rich treasure. I do not know 
the exact spot, but it is there, and you will surely find it. Spare no energy and leave no spot u nturned in 
your search."  
The father died, and no sooner was he in his grave than the sons set to work digging with all their might, 
turning up every foot of ground with their spad es, and going over the whole farm two or three times.  
No hidden gold did they  find; but at harvest time when they had settled their accounts and had pocketed a 
rich profit far greater than that of any of their neighbours, they understood that the treasure their father 
had told them about was the wealth of a bountiful crop, and that  in their industry had they found the 
treasure.  
Industry is itself a treasure.

79. THE TWO  POTS  
Two pots, one of brass and the other of clay, stood together on the hea rthstone. One day the brass pot 
proposed to the earthen pot that they go out into the world together. But the earthen pot excused himself, 
saying that it would be wiser for him to  stay in the corner by the fire.  
"It would take so little to break me," he sa id. "You know how fragile I am. The least shock is sure to shatter 
me!"  
"Don't let that keep you at home," urged the brass pot. "I shall take very good care of you. If we should 
happen to meet anything hard I will step between and save you."  
So the earthen  pot at last consented, and the two set out side by side, jolting along on three stubby legs 
first to this side, then to that, and bumping into each other at every step.  
The earthen pot could not survive that sort of companionship very long. They had not g one ten paces 
before the earthen pot cracked, and at the next jolt he fl ew into a thousand pieces.  
Equals make the best friends.

80. THE GOOSE AND THE GOLDEN EGG  
There was on ce a countryman who possessed the most wonderful goose you can imagine, for every day 
when he visited the nest, the goose had laid a beautiful, glittering, golden egg.  
83 
 The countryman t ook the eggs to market and soon began to get rich. But it was not long b efore he grew 
impatient with the goose because she gave him only a single golden egg a day. He was not getting rich fast 
enough.  
Then one day, after he had finished counting his money,  the idea came to him that he could get all the 
golden eggs at once by k illing the goose and cutting it open. But when the deed was done, not a single 
golden egg did he find, and his precious goose was dead.

 Two bulls were fighting furiously in a field, at one side of which was a marsh. An old fro g living in the 
marsh, trembled as he watched the fierce battle.  
"What a re you afraid of?" asked a young frog.  
"Do you not see," replied the old frog, "that the bull who is beaten, will be driven away from the good 
forage up there to the reeds of this mars h, and we shall all be trampled into the mud?"  
It turned out as the frog  had said. The beaten bull was driven to the marsh, where his great hoofs crushed 
the frogs to death.

82. THE MOUSE AND THE WEASEL  
A little hungry mouse found his way one day into a basket of corn. He had t o squeeze himself a good deal 
to get through the narrow opening between the strips of the basket. But the corn was tempting and the 
mouse was determined to get in. When at last he had succee ded, he gorged himself to bursting. Indeed he 
he became about thre e times as big around the middle as he was when he went in.  
At last he felt satisfied and dragged himself to the opening to get out again. But the best he could do was to 
get his head out. S o there he sat groaning and moaning, both from the discomfort insi de him and his 
anxiety to escape from the basket.  
Just then a weasel came by. He understood the situation quickly.  
"My friend," he said, "I know what you've been doing. You've been stuffing.  That's what you get. You will 
have to stay there till you feel ju st like you did when you went in. Good night, and good enough for you."  
And that was all the sympathy the poor mouse got.

A farmer walked through his field one cold winter morning. On the ground lay a snake, stiff and frozen with 
the cold. The f armer k new how deadly the snake could be, and yet he picked it up and put it in his bosom to 
warm it back to life.  
The snake soon revived, and when it had enough strength, bit the man who had been so kind to it. The bite 
was deadly and the farmer felt that  he mus t die. As he drew his last breath, he said to those standing

A stag had fallen sick. He had just strength enough to gather some food and find a qui et clea ring in the

illness and came to ask after his health. Of course, they were all hungry, and helped themselves freely to

85. THE GOATHERD AND THE WILD GOATS  
 One cold stormy day a goatherd drove his goats for shelter into a cave, where a number of wild goats had 
also found their way. The g oatherd wanted  to make the wild goats part of his flock; so he fed them well. 
But to his own flock, he gave only just enough food to keep them alive. When the weather cleared, and the 
goatherd led the goats out to feed, the wild goats scampered off to the hills.  
"Is tha t the thanks I get for feeding you and treating you so well?" complained the goatherd.  
"Do not expect us to join your flock," replied one of the wild goats. "We know how you would treat us later 
on, if some strangers should come as we did."

 A young fellow, who was very popular among his boon companions as a good spender, quickly wasted his 
fortune trying to live up to his reputation. Then one f ine day in ear ly spring he found himself with not a 
penny left, and no property save the clothes he wore.  
He was to meet some jolly young men that morning, and he was at his wits' end how to get enough money 
to keep up appearances. Just then a swallow flew  by, twitterin g merrily, and the young man, thinking 
summer had come, hastened off to a clothes dealer, to whom he sold all the clothes he wore down to his 
very tunic.  
A few days later a change in weather brought a severe frost; and the poor swallow and th at foolish you ng

some birds in the neighborhood were ailing and needed a doctor. So he put on a pair of spectacles, and 
with a leather bo x in his hand,  knocked at the door of the bird's home.  
The birds peeped out, and Dr. Cat, with much solicitude, asked how they were. He would be very happy to 
give them some medicine.

 A man who lived a long time ago believed that he could read the future in the s tars. He called himself an 
astrologer, and spent his time at night gazing at the sky.  
One evening he was walking along the open road outside the village. His eyes were fixed on the stars. He 
thought he saw there that the end of the world was at hand, when all at once, down he went i nto a hole 
full of mud and water.  
There he stood up to his ears, in the muddy water, and madly clawing at the slippery sides of the hole in his 
effort to climb out.  
His cries for help soon brought the villagers running. As they p ulled him out of the mud, o ne of them said:  
"You pretend to read the future in the stars, and yet you fail to see what is at your feet! This may teach you 
to pay more attention to what is right in front of you, and let the future take care of itself."  
"Wha t use is it," said another,  "to read the stars, when you can't see what's right here on the earth?"

90. THREE BULLOCKS AND A LION  
 A lion had been watching three bullocks feeding in an open field. He had tried to attack them several 
times, but they had kept together, and helped each other to drive him off. The lion had little hope of eatin g 
them, for he was no match for three str ong bullocks with their sharp horns and hoofs. But he could not 
keep away from that field, for it is hard to resist watching a good meal, even when there is little chance of 
getting it.  
Then one day the bullocks had  a quarrel, and when the hungry lion came  to look at them and lick his chops 
as he was accustomed to do, he found them in separate corners of the field, as far away from one another 
as they could get.  
It was now an easy matter for the lion to attack them o ne at a time, and this he proceeded to do  with the 
greatest satisfaction and relish.

91. MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN  
 A poor woodman was cutting down a tree near th e edge of a deep pool in the forest. It w as late in the day 
and the woodman was tired. He had been working since sunrise and his strokes were not so sure as they 
had been early that morning. Thus , it happened that the axe slipped and flew out of his hands into the pool.  
The woodman was in despair . The axe was all he possessed with which to make a living, and he had not 
money enough to buy a new one. As he stood wringing his hands and weeping, the god Mercury suddenly 
appeared and asked what the trouble was.  The woodman told what had happened, and straightaway the 
kind Mercury dived into the pool. When he came up again , he held a wonderful golden axe.  
"Is this your axe?" Mercury asked the woodman.  
"No," answered the honest woodman, "that is not my axe."  
Mercu ry laid the golden axe on the bank and sp rang back into the pool. This time he brought up an axe of 
silver, but the woodman declared again that his axe was just an ordinary one with a wooden handle.  
Mercury dived down for the third time, and when he came u p again he had the very axe that had been  lost.  
The poor woodman was very glad that his axe had been found and could not thank the kind god enough. 
Mercury was greatly pleased with the woodman's honesty.  
"I admire your honesty," he said, "and as a reward y ou may have all three axes, the gold and the silver as 
well as your own."  
The happy woodman returned to his home with his treasures, and soon the story of his good fortune was 
known to everybody in the village. Now there were several woodmen in the village  who believed that they 
could easily win the same good fortune. They hurried out into the woods, one here, one there, and hiding 
their axes in the bushes, pretended they had lost them. Then they wept and wailed and called on Mercury 
to help them.  
And indee d, Mercury did appear, first to this one,  then to that. To each one he showed an axe of gold, and 
each one eagerly claimed it to be the one he had lost. But Mercury did not give them the golden axe. Oh 
no! Instead he gave them each a hard whack over the he ad with it and sent them home. And when t hey 
returned next day to look for their own axes, they were nowhere to be found.  
Honesty is the best policy.

 92. THE FROG AND THE MOUSE  
 A young m ouse in search of adventure was running along the bank of a pond where lived a frog. When the 
frog saw the mouse, he swam to the bank and croaked:  
"Won' t you pay me a visit? I can promise you a good time if you do."  
The mouse did not need much coaxing, for  he was very anxious to see the world and everything in it. But 
though he could swim a little, he did not dare risk going into the pond without some hel p. 
The frog had a plan. He tied the mouse's leg to his own with a tough reed. Then into the pond he jump ed, 
dragging his foolish companion with him.  
The mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous frog had other plans. 
He pulled the mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that 
bound hi m to the dead mouse, a hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the mouse floating 
on the water, the hawk swooped down, seized the mouse and carried it off, with the frog dangling from its 
leg. Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner.  
Those who seek to harm others often come to harm themselves through their own deceit.

93. THE FOX AND THE CRAB  
A crab one day grew disgusted with the sands in which he lived. He decided to take a stroll to the meadow 
not far inland. There he would find better fare than briny water and sand mites. So off he crawled to th e 
meadow. But there a h ungry fox spied him, and in a twinkling, ate him up, both shell and claw.

94. THE SERPENT AND THE EAGLE  
A serpent had succeeded in surprising an eagle  and had wrapped himsel f around the eagle's neck. The 
eagle could not reach the serpent, neither with beak nor claws. Far into the sky he soared trying to shake 
off his enemy. But the serpent's hold only tightened, and slowly the eagle sank back to earth, gasping for 
breath.  
A countryman chanced to see the unequal combat. In pity for the noble Eagle he rushed up and soon had 
loosened the coiling serpent and freed the eagle.  
The serpent was furious. He had no chance to bite the watchful countryman. Instead h e struck at the 
drinkin g horn, hanging at the countryman's belt, and into it let fly the poison of his fangs.  
89 
 The countryman now went on towards home. Becoming thirsty on the way, he filled his horn at a spring, 
and was about to drink. There was a sudden r ush of great wings. Swe eping down, the eagle seized the 
poisoned horn from out his savior's hands, and flew away with it to hide it where it could never be found.  
An act of kindness is well repaid.

95. THE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING  
 A ce rtain wolf could not get enough to eat because of the watchfulness of the shepherds. But one night he 
found a sheep skin that had been cast aside and forgotten. The next day, dressed in the skin, the wolf 
strolled into the pastur e with the sheep. Soon a li ttle lamb was following him about and was quickly led 
away to slaughter.  
That evening the wolf entered the fold with the flock. But it happened that the shepherd took a fancy for 
mutton broth that very evening, and, picking up a knife, went to the fold. Th ere the first he laid hands on 
and killed was the wolf.  
The evil doer often comes to harm through his own deceit.

96. THE BULL AND THE GOAT  
 A bull once escaped from a lion by entering a cave which the goatherds used to house their flocks in 
stormy weather and at night. It happened that one of the goats had been left behind, and the bull had  no 
sooner got inside than this goat lowered his head and made a rush at him, butting him with his horns. As 
the lion was still prowling outside the entrance to the cave, the bull had to submit to the insult.  
"Do not think," he said, "that I submit to your  cowardly treatment because  I am afraid of you. When that 
Lion leaves, I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget."  
It is wicked to take advantage of another's distress.

 97. THE EAGLE AND THE BEETLE  
A beetle once begged the eagle to spare a ha re which had run to her for  protection. But the eagle pounced 
upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at the 
disrespect shown her, the beetle flew to the eagle's nest and rolled out the eggs. Not one did s he spare. 
The eagle's grief  and anger knew no bounds, but who had done the cruel deed she did not know.  
On the following year the Eagle built her nest far up on a mountain crag; but the beetle found it and again 
destroyed the eggs. In despair the eagle now  implored great Jupiter to let her place her eggs in his lap. 
There none would dare harm them. But the beetle buzzed about Jupiter's head, and made him rise to drive 
her away; and the eggs rolled from his lap.  
Now the beetle told the reason for her action,  and Jupiter had to acknowl edge the justice of her cause. And 
they say that ever after, while the eagle's eggs lie in the nest in spring, the beetle still sleeps in the ground. 
For so Jupiter commanded.  
Even the weakest may find means to avenge a wrong.

98. THE OLD LION AND THE FOX  
 An old lion, whose teeth and claws were so worn that it was not so easy for him to get food as in his 
younger days, pr etended that he was sick. He took care to let all his neighbors know about it, and then lay 
down in his cave to wait for visitors. And when they came to offer him their sympathy, he ate them up one 
by one.  
The fox came too, but he was very cautious about i t. Standing at a safe distanc e from the cave, he inquired 
politely after the lion's health. The lion replied that he was very ill indeed, and asked the fox to step in for a 
moment. But Master Fox very wisely stayed outside, thanking the lion very kindly fo r the invitation.  
"I should b e glad to do as you ask," he added, "but I have noticed that there are many footprints leading 
into your cave and none coming out. Pray tell me, how do your visitors find their way out again?"  
Take warning from the misfortunes of others.

99. THE MAN AND THE LION  
A lion and a man chanced to travel in company through the forest. They soon began to quarrel, for each of 
them boasted  that he and his kind were fa r superior to the other both in strength and mind.  
Now they reached a clearing in the forest and there stood a statue. It was a representation of Heracles in 
the act of tearing the jaws of the Nemean lion.  
91 
 "See," said the man, "that's how strong we are! Th e king of beasts is like wax in our hands!"  
"Ho!" laughed the lion, "a man made that statue. It would have been quite a different scene had a lion 
made it!"  
It all depends on the point of view, and who tells the story.

100. THE ASS AND  THE LAP DOG  
 There was once an ass whose master also owned a lap dog. This dog was a favorite and received many a 
pat and kind word from his ma ster, as well as choice bits from his plate. Every day the dog would run to 
meet the master, frisking playfully about and leaping up to lick his hands and face.  
All this the ass saw with much discontent. Though he was well fed, he had much work to do; besi des, the 
master hardly ever t ook any notice of him.  
Now the jealous ass got it into his silly head that all he had to do to win his master's favour was to act like 
the dog. So one day he left his stable and clattered eagerly into the house.  
Finding his mas ter seated at the dinner tabl e, he kicked up his heels and, with a loud bray, pranced giddily 
around the table, upsetting it as he did so. Then he planted his forefeet on his master's knees and rolled out 
his tongue to lick the master's face, as he had see n the dog do. But his weight upset the chair, and ass and 
man rolled over together in the pile of broken dishes from the table.  
The master was much alarmed at the strange behavior of the ass, and calling for help, soon attracted the 
attention of the servants. When they saw the danger the master was in from the clumsy beast, they set 
upon the ass and drove him with kicks and blows b ack to the stable. There they left him to mourn the 
foolishness that had brought him nothing but a sound beating.  
Behavior that is regarded as agreeable in o ne is very rude and impertinent in another.  
Do not try to gain favour by acting in a way that is co ntrary to your own nature and character.

101. THE MILKMAID AND HER PAIL  
 A milkmaid had been out to milk the cows and was returning from the field with the shining milk pail 
balanced nicely on her head. As she walked along, her pretty head was busy w ith plans for the days to 
come.  
"This good, rich milk," she mused, "will give me plenty of cream to churn. The butter I make I will take to 
market, and with the money I g et for it I will buy a lot of eggs for hatching. How nice it will be when they 
92 
 are all  hatched and the yard is full of fine young chicks. Then when May day comes I will sell them, and with 
the money I'll buy a lovely new dress to wear to the fair. All the young men will look at me. They will come 
and try to make love to me,  —but I shall ver y quickly send them about their business!"  
As she thought of how she would settle that matter, she tossed her head scornfully, and down fell the pail 
of milk to the groun d. And all the milk flowed out, and with it vanished butter and eggs and chicks and ne w 
dress and all the milkmaid's pride.

 A miser had buried his gold in a secret place in his garden. Every day he went to the spot, dug up the

treasure and made off with it.

 When the miser discovered his loss, he was overcome with grief and despair. He groaned and cried a nd

A passerby heard his cries and asked what had happened.  
"My gold! O my gold!" cried the miser, wildly, "someone has robbed me!"  
"Your gold! There  in that hole? Why did you put it there? Why did you not keep it in the house where you 
could  easily get it when you had to buy things?"  
"Buy!" screamed the miser angrily. "Why, I never touched the gold. I couldn't think of spending any of it."  
The strange r picked up a large stone and threw it into the hole.

105. THE WOLF AND THE HOUSE DOG  
 There w as once a wolf who got very little to eat because the dogs of the village were very wide awake and 
watchful. He was really nothing but s kin and bones, and it made him very downhearted to think of it.  
One night this wolf happened to fall in with a fine fat house dog who had wandered a little too far from 
home. The wolf would gladly have eaten him then and there, but the house dog looked str ong enough to 
leave his marks should he try it. So the wolf spoke very humbly to the dog, complimenting him on his fine 
appearance.  
"You can be as well -fed as I am if you want to," replied the dog. "Leave the woods; there you live miserably. 
Why, you have to fight hard for every bite you get. Follow my example and you will get along beautifully."  
"What must I do?" asked the  wolf.  
"Hardly anything," answered the house dog. "Chase people who carry canes, bark at beggars, and fawn on 
the people of the house. I n return you will get titbits of every kind, chicken bones, choice bits of meat, 
sugar, cake, and much more beside s, not  to speak of kind words and caresses."  
The wolf had such a beautiful vision of his coming happiness that he almost wept. But just then h e noticed 
that the hair on the dog's neck was worn and the skin was chafed.  
"What is that on your neck?"  
"Nothing at all ," replied the Dog.  
"What! nothing!"  
"Oh, just a trifle!"  
"But please tell me."  
"Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chai n is fastened."  
"What! A chain!" cried the wolf. "Don't you go wherever you please?"  
94 
 "Not always! But what's the differe nce?" replied the dog.  
"All the difference in the world! I don't care a rap for your feasts and I wouldn't take all the tender young 
lambs in the world at that price." And away ran the wolf to the woods.  
There is nothing worth so much as liberty.

106. THE FOX AND THE HEDGEHOG  
 A fox, swimming across a river, was barely able to reach the bank, where he lay bruised and exhausted 
from his struggl e with the swift current.  Soon a swarm of blood -sucking flies settled on him; but he lay 
quietly, still too weak to run away from them.  
A hedgehog happened by. "Let me drive the flies away," he said kindly.  
"No, no!" exclaimed the Fox, "do not disturb them ! They have taken all the y can hold. If you drive them 
away, another greedy swarm will come and take the little blood I have left."  
Better to bear a lesser evil than to risk a greater in removing it.

107. TH E BAT AND THE WEASELS  
 A bat blundered into the nest of a weasel, who ran up to catch and eat him. The bat begged for his life, but 
the weasel w ould not listen.  
"You are  a mouse," he said, "and I am a sworn enemy of mice. Every mouse I catch, I am going to eat!"  
"But I am not a mouse!" cried the bat. "Look at my wings. Can mice fly? Why, I am only a bird! Please let me 
go!"  
The Weasel had to admit  that the bat was not a m ouse, so he let him go. But a few days later, the foolish 
bat went blindly into the nest of another weasel. This weasel happened to be a bitter enemy of birds, and 
he soon had the bat under his claws, ready to eat him.  
95 
 "You are a b ird," he said, "and I am going to eat you!"  
"What," cried the bat, "I, a bird! Why, all birds have feathers! I am nothing but a mouse. 'Down with all 
cats,' is my motto!"  
And so the bat escaped with his life a second time.

An old toad once informed all his neighbors that he was a learned doctor. In fact  he could cure anything. 
The fox heard the news and hurried to see the toad . He looked the toad over very carefully.  
"Mr. Toad," he said, "I've been told that you cure anything! But just take a look at yourself, and then try 
some of your own medicine. If y ou can cure yourself of that blotchy skin and that rheumatic gait, someone 
might believe you. Otherwise, I should advise you to try some other profession."

109. THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL  
 A fox that had been caught in a trap, succeeded at last, after much painful tugging, in getting away. But he 
had to leave his beautiful bushy tail behind him.  
For a long time , he kept aw ay from the other foxes, for he knew well enough that they would all make fun 
of him and crack jokes and laugh behind his back. But it was hard for him to live alone, and at last he  
thought of a plan that would perhaps help him out of his trouble.  
He calle d a meeting of all the foxes, saying that he had something of great importance to tell the tribe.  
When they were all gathered together, the fox without a tail got up and made a long  speech about those 
foxes who had come to harm because of their tails.  
This one had been caught by hounds when his tail had become entangled in the hedge. That one had not 
been able to run fast enough because of the weight of his brush. Besides, it was wel l known, he said, that 
men hunt Foxes simply for their tails, which they cu t off as prizes of the hunt. With such proof of the 
danger and uselessness of having a tail, said Master Fox, he would advise every fox to cut it off, if he valued 
life and safety.  
When he had finished talking, an old fox arose, and said, smiling:  
"Master Fox, kindly turn around for a moment, and you shall have your answer."  
96 
 When the poor fox without a tail turned around, there arose such a storm of jeers and hooting, that he saw 
how  useless it was to try any longer to persuade the foxes to part with their tails.  
Do not listen to the advice of someone who seeks to lower you to his own level.

 There was once a dog who was so ill -natured and mischievous that his master had to fasten a heavy 
wooden clog about his neck to keep him from a nnoying visitors and neighbours. But the dog seemed to be 
very proud of the clog and dragged it about noisily as if he wished to attract everybody's attention. He was 
not able to impress anyone.  
"You would be wiser," said an old acquaintance, "to keep quie tly out of sight with that clog. Do you want

A butterfly once fell in love with a beautiful rose. The rose was not indifferent, for the butterfly's wings 
were powder ed in a charming pattern of gold and silver. And so, when he fluttered near and told how he 
loved her, she blushed rosily and said yes. A fter much pretty love -making and many whispered vows of 
constancy, the butterfly took a tender leave of his sweetheart.  
But alas! It was a long time before he came back to her.  
"Is this your constancy?" she exclaimed tearfully. "It is ages since you went a way, and all the time, you have 
been carrying on with all sorts of flowers. I saw you kiss Miss Geranium, and you flutt ered around Miss 
Mignonette until Honey Bee chased you away. I wish he had stung you!"  
"Constancy!" laughed the Butterfly. "I had no soon er left you than I saw Zephyr kissing you. You carried on 
scandalously with Mr. Bumble Bee and you made eyes at every s ingle Bug you could see. You can't expect 
any constancy from me!"  (Do not expect constancy in others if you have none yourself. )

112. THE CAT AND THE FOX  
 Once a cat and a fox were traveling together. A s they went along, picking up provisions on the way —a 
stray mouse here, a fat chicken there —they began an argument to w hile away the time between bites. 
And, as usually happens when comrades argue, the talk began to get personal.  
"You think you are extreme ly clever, don't you?" said the fox. "Do you pretend to know more than I? Why, I 
know a whole sackful of tricks!"  
"Well ," retorted the cat, "I admit I know one trick only, but that one, let me tell you, is worth a thousand of 
yours!"  
Just then, close by, t hey heard a hunter's horn and the yelping of a pack of hounds. In an instant the cat 
was up a tree, hiding among the le aves.  
"This is my trick," he called to the fox. "Now let me see what yours are worth."  
But the fox had so many plans for escape he could not decide which one to try first. He dodged here and 
there with the hounds at his heels. He doubled on his tracks, he ran at top speed, he entered a dozen 
burrows,  —but all in vain. The hounds caught him, and soon put an end to the boaster and all his tric ks. 
Common sense is always worth more than cunning.

Where were now his strength and his former  graceful beauty?  
Now a boar spied him, and rushing at him, gored him with his yellow tusk. A bull trampled him with his

115. THE FOX AND THE PHEASANTS  
 One moonlit evening as Master Fox was taking his usual stroll in the woods, he saw a number of pheasants 
perched quite out of  his reach on a limb of a tall old tree. The sly fox soon found a bright patch of 
moonlight, where the pheasants could see him clea rly; there he raised himself up on his hind legs, and 
began a wild dance. First , he whirled 'round and 'round like a top, then  he hopped up and down, cutting all 
sorts of strange capers. The pheasants stared giddily. They hardly dared blink for fear of losi ng him out of 
their sight a single instant.  
Now the fox made as if to climb a tree, now he fell over and lay still, playing d ead, and the next instant he 
was hopping on all fours, his back in the air, and his bushy tail shaking so that it seemed to throw o ut silver 
sparks in the moonlight.  
By this time the poor birds' heads were in a whirl. And when the fox began his performance  all over again, 
so dazed did they become, that they lost their hold on the limb, and fell down one by one to the fox.

116. TWO TRAVELERS AND A BEAR  
 Two men were traveling in company through a forest, when, all at once, a huge bear  crashed out of the 
brush near them.  
One of the men, thinking of his own safety, climbed a tree.  
The other, unable to fight the savage beast alone, threw himself on the ground and lay still, as if he was 
dead. He had heard that a Bear will not touch a dead  body.  
It must have been true, for the bear snuffed at the man's head awhile, and then, seeming to be satisfied 
that he was dead, walked away.  
99 
 The man in the tree climbed down.  
"It looked just as if that bear whispered in your ear," he said. "What did he t ell you?"  
"He said," answered the other, "that it was not at all wise to keep company with a fellow who would deser t

118. THE FOX AND THE MONKEY  
 At a great meeting of the animals, who had gathered to elect a new ruler, th e monkey was asked to dance. 
This he did so well, with a thousand funny capers and grimaces, that the animals were carried entirely off 
their fee t with enthusiasm, and then and there, elected him their king.  
The fox did not vote for the monkey and was much  disgusted with the animals for electing so unworthy a 
ruler.  
One day he found a trap with a bit of meat in it. Hurrying to King Monkey, he told him he had found a rich 
treasure, which he had not touched because it belonged by right to his majesty the Monk ey. 
The greedy monkey followed the fox to the trap. As soon as he saw the meat he grasped eagerly for it, only 
to find himself held fast in the t rap. The fox stood off and laughed.  
"You pretend to be our king," he said, "and cannot even take care of yourse lf!" 
Shortly after that, another election among the animals was held.

 Early one morning a hungry wolf was prowling around a cottage at the edge of a village, when  he heard a 
child crying in the house. Then he heard the mother's voice say:  
"Hush, child, hush! Stop your crying, or I will give you to the wolf !" 
Surprised but delighted at the prospect of so delicious a meal, the wolf settled down under an open 
window, expecting every moment to have the child handed out to him. But though the little one continued 
to fret, the wolf waited all day in vain. Then, t owards nightfall, he heard the Mother's voice again as she sat 
down near the window to sing and rock her baby t o sleep.  
"There, child, there! The wolf shall not get you. No, no! Daddy is watching and Daddy will kill him if he 
should come near!"  
Just then t he father came within sight of the home, and the wolf was barely able to save himself from the 
dogs by a clever  bit of running.

A jar of honey was upset and the sticky sweetness flowed out on the table. The  sweet smell of the honey 
soon brought a large number of flies buzzing around. They did not wait for an invitation. No, indeed; they 
settled right down, feet and all, to gorge th emselves. The flies were quickly smeared from head to foot with 
honey. Their w ings stuck together. They could not pull their feet out of the sticky mass. And so they died, 
giving their lives for the sake of a taste of sweetness.

"I want to get married," replied the eagle, "and I can't  find a mate who can provide for me as I should like."  
"Take me," said the kit e; "I am very strong, stronger even than you!"  
"Do you really think you can provide for me?" asked the eagle eagerly.  
"Why, of course," replied the kite. "That would be a very si mple matter. I am so strong I can carry away an 
ostrich in my talons as if it were a feather!"  
The eagle accepted the kite immediately. But after the wedding, when the kite flew away to find something 
to eat for his bride, all he had when he returned, was a tiny mouse.  
"Is that the ostrich you talked about?" said the eagle in disgus t. 
"To win you I would have said and promised anything," replied the kite.  
Everything is fair in love.

122. THE STAG, THE SHEEP, AND THE WOLF  
 One day a stag came to a sheep and asked her to lend him a measure of wheat. The sheep knew hi m for a 
very swift runner, who could easily take himself out of reach, were he s o inclined. So she asked him if he 
knew someone who would answer for him.  
"Yes, yes," answered the stag confidently, "the wolf has promised to be my surety."  
"The wolf!" exclai med the sheep indignantly. "Do you think I would trust you on such security? I k now the 
wolf! He takes what he wants and runs off with it without paying. As for you, you can use your legs so well 
that I should have little chance of collecting the debt if I  had to catch you for it!"  
Two wrongs do not make a right.

123. THE ANIMALS AND THE PLAGUE  
 Once upon a time a severe plague raged among the animals. Many died, and those who lived were so ill, 
that they cared for neither food nor drink, and dragged themselves about listlessly. No longer could a fat 
young hen tempt Master Fox to dinner, nor a tender lamb rouse greedy Sir Wolf's appetite.  
At last , the lion decided to call a council. When all the animal s were gathered together he arose and said:  
"Dear friends, I believe the gods ha ve sent this plague upon us as a punishment for our sins. Therefore, the 
most guilty one of us must be offered in sacrifice. Perhaps we may thus obtain forgiveness and cure for  all. 
"I will confess all my sins first. I admit that I have been very greedy an d have devoured many sheep. They 
had done me no harm. I have eaten goats and bulls and stags. To tell the truth, I even ate up a shepherd 
now and then.  
"Now, if I am the most g uilty, I am ready to be sacrificed. But I think it best that each one confess es his sins 
as I have done. Then we can decide in all justice who is the most guilty."  
"Your majesty," said the fox, "you are too good. Can it be a crime to eat sheep, such stupid  mutton heads? 
No, no, your majesty. You have done them great honor by eating th em up.  
"And so far as shepherds are concerned, we all know they belong to that puny race that pretends to be our 
masters."  
All the animals applauded the fox loudly. Then, thoug h the tiger, the bear, the wolf, and all the savage 
beasts recited the most wick ed deeds, all were excused and made to appear very saint -like and innocent.  
It was now the ass's turn to confess.  
"I remember," he said guiltily, "that one day as I was passing a field belonging to some priests, I was so 
tempted by the tender grass and my hunger, that I could not resist nibbling a bit of it. I had no right to do it, 
I admit —" 
A great uproar among the beasts interrupted him. Here was the culprit who had br ought misfortune on all 
of them! What a horrible crime it was to eat grass that belonge d to someone else! It was enough to hang 
anyone for, much more an ass.  
Immediately they all fell upon him, the wolf in the lead, and soon had made an end to him, sacrifi cing him 
to the gods then and there, and without the formality of an altar.  
The weak ar e made to suffer for the misdeeds of the powerful.

124. THE SHEPHERD AND THE LION  
 A shepherd, counting his sheep one day, discovered that a number of them were missing.  
Much irritated, he very l oudly and boastfully declared that he would catch the thief and punish him as he 
deserv ed. The shepherd suspected a wolf of the deed and so set out towards a rocky region among the 
hills, where there were caves infested by wolves. But before starting out h e made a vow to Jupiter that if he 
would help him find the thief he would offer a fat c alf as a sacrifice.  
The shepherd searched a long time without finding any wolves, but just as he was passing near a large cave 
on the mountain side, a huge lion stalked out, carrying a sheep. In great terror the shepherd fell on his 
knees.  
"Alas, O Jupiter , man does not know what he asks! To find the thief I offered to sacrifice a fat calf. Now I 
promise you a full -grown bull, if you but make the thief go away!"  
We are of ten not so eager for what we seek, after we have found it.  
Do not foolishly ask for thi ngs that would bring ruin if they were granted.

125. THE DOG AND HIS REFLECTI ON 
 A dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hur rying home with his prize as fast as he could go. 
As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he  happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water 
as if in a mirror. But the greedy dog thought he saw a real dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own.  
If he had stopped to think he would have known better. But instead of thinking, he  dropped his bone and 
sprang at the dog in the river, only to find himself swimming for dear life to reach the shore. At last he 
managed to scramble out, and as he stood sadl y thinking about the good bone he had lost, he realized what 
a stupid dog he had b een.  
It is very foolish to be greedy.

DETRWA SANTE INOSANS EK EXPERYANS  PAR WILLIAM BLAKE   
THE ECHOING GR EEN 
The sun does arise,  
And make happy the skies;  
The merry bells ring  
To welcome the Spring;  
The skylark and thrush,  
The birds of the bush,  
Sing louder around  
To the bells’ cheerful sound;  
While our sports shall be seen  
On the echoing green.  
Old John, wi th white hair,  
Does laugh away care,  
Sitting under the oak,  
Among the old folk.  
They laugh at our play,  
And soon they all say,  
‘Such, such were the joys  
When we all —girls and boys — 
In our youth -time were seen  
On the echoing green.’  
Till the little ones, w eary,  
No more can be merry:  
The sun does descend,  
And our sports have an end.  
Round the laps of their mothers  
Many sisters and brothers,  
Like birds in their nest,  
Are ready for rest,  
And sport no more seen  
On the darkening green.

Little lamb, who made thee?

Gave thee life, and  bid thee feed  
By the stream and o’er the mead;  
Gave thee clothing of delight,  
Softest clot hing, woolly, bright;  
Gave thee such a tender voice,  
Making all the vales rejoice?  
Little lamb, who made thee?  
Does thou know who made thee?  
Little lamb, I’ll tell thee;  
Little lamb, I’ll tell thee:  
He is called by thy name,  
For He calls Himself a Lamb.  
He is meek, and He is mild,  
He became a little child.

We are called by His name.

O do not walk so fast!  
Speak, father, speak to your little boy,

And away the vapour flew .

Appeared like hi s father, in white.

And to his mother brought,

Her little boy weeping sought.

Sweet dreams, form a shade  
O’er my lovely infant’s head!  
Sweet dreams of pleasant str eams  
By happy, silent, moony beams!  
Sweet Sleep, with soft down  
Weave thy brows an infant crown!  
Sweet Sleep, angel mild,  
Hover o’er my happy child !  
Sweet smiles, in the night  
Hover over my delight!  
Sweet smiles, mother’s smiles,  
All the livelong night b eguiles.  
Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,  
Chase not slumber from thy eyes!  
Sweet moans, sweeter smiles,  
All the dovelike moans beguiles.

All creation slept and smiled.  
Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,  
While o’er thee thy mother weep.  
Sweet babe, in thy face  
Holy image I can trace;  
Sweet babe, once like thee  
Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:  
Wept for me, for thee, for all,  
When He wa s an infant small.  
Thou His image ever see,  
Heavenly face that smiles on thee!

NIGHT  
The sun descending in the West,  
The evening star does sh ine; 
The birds are silent in their nest,  
And I must seek for mine.  
The moon, like a flower  
In heaven’s high bower,  
With silent delig ht, 
Sits and smiles on the night.  
Farewell, green fields and happy groves,  
Where flocks have took delight,  
Where lambs have  nibbled, silent moves  
The feet of angels bright;  
Unseen, they pour blessing,  
And joy without ceasing,  
On each bud and blossom,  
And each sleeping bosom.  
They look in every thoughtless nest  
Where birds are covered warm;  
They visit caves of every beast,  
To keep them all from harm:  
If they see any weeping  
That should have been sleeping,  
They pour sleep on their head,  
And sit down by thei r bed.  
When wolves and tigers howl for prey,  
They pitying stand and weep;  
Seeking to drive their thirst away,  
And keep them  from the sheep.  
But, if they rush dreadful,  
The angels, most heedful,  
Receive each mild spirit,  
New worlds to inherit.  
And there t he lion’s ruddy eyes  
Shall flow with tears of gold:  
And pitying the tender cries,  
And walking round the fold:  
Saying: ‘Wrat h by His meekness,  
And, by His health, sickness,  
Is driven away  
From our immortal day.  
‘And now beside thee, bleating lamb,  
I can l ie down and sleep,  
Or think on Him who bore thy name,  
Graze after thee, and weep.  
111 
 For, washed in life’s river,  
My bright man e for ever  
Shall shine like the gold,  
As I guard o’er the fold.’

ON ANOTHER’S SORROW  
Can I see another’s woe,  
And not be in sorrow too?  
Can I see another’s grief,  
And not seek for kind relief?  
Can I see a falling tear,  
And not feel my sorrow’s share?  
Can a  father see his child  
Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?  
Can a mother sit and hear  
An infant groan, an infant fear ? 
No, no! never can it be!  
Never, never can it be!  
And can He who smiles on all  
Hear the wren with sorrows small,  
Hear the small bird’s grief and care,  
Hear the woes that infants bear —  
And not sit beside the nest,  
Pouring pity in their breast,  
And not sit the cradle near,  
Weeping tear on infant’s tear?  
And not sit both night and day,  
Wiping all our tears away?  
O no! never can it be!  
Never, nev er can it be!  
He doth give His joy to all:  
He becomes an infant small,  
He becomes a man of woe,  
He doth feel t he sorrow too.  
Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,  
And thy Maker is not by:  
113 
 Think not thou canst weep a tear,  
And thy Maker is not near.  
O He giv es to us His joy,  
That our grief He may destroy:  
Till our grief is fled and gone  
He doth sit by us and moan.

THE CLOD AND THE PEBBLE  
‘Love seeketh not itself to please,  
Nor for itself hath any care,  
But for another gives its ease,  
And builds a heaven in hell’s despair.’  
So sung a little clod of clay,  
Trodden with the cattle’s feet,  
But a pebble of the brook  
Warbled out these metres meet:  
‘Love seeketh only Self to please,  
To bind another to its delight,  
Joys in another’s loss of ease,  
And builds a hell in heaven’s despite.’

HOLY THURSDAY  
Is this a holy thing to  see 
In a rich and fruitful land,  — 
Babes reduced to misery,  
Fed with cold and usurous hand?  
Is that trembling cry a song?  
Can it be a song of joy?  
And so m any children poor?  
It is a land of poverty!  
115 
 And their sun does never shine,  
And their fields are bl eak and bare,  
And their ways are filled with thorns,  
It is eternal winter there.  
For where’er the sun does shine,  
And where’er the rain does fall,  
Babe can  never hunger there,  
Nor poverty the mind appal.

THE LITTLE GIRL LOST  
In futurity  
I prophesy  
That the earth from sleep  
(Grave the sen tence deep)  
Shall arise, and seek  
For her Maker meek;  
And the desert wild  
Become a garden mild .  
In the southern clime,  
Where the summer’s prime  
Never fades away,  
Lovely Lyca lay.  
Seven summers old  
Lovely Lyca told.  
116 
 She had wandered long,  
Hearing wild bi rds’ song.  
‘Sweet sleep, come to me,  
Underneath this tree;  
Do father, mother, weep?  
Where can Lyca sleep?  
‘Lost in desert wild  
Is your little child.  
How can Lyca sleep  
If her mother weep?  
‘If her heart does ache,  
Then let Lyca wake;  
If my mother sleep,  
Lyca shall not weep.  
‘Frowning, frowning night,  
O’er this desert bright  
Let thy moon arise,  
While I close my eyes.’  
Sleeping Lyca lay,  
While the beasts of prey,  
Come from caverns deep,  
Viewed the maid asleep.  
The kingly lion stood,  
And the virgin viewed : 
Then he gambolled round  
O’er the hallowed ground.  
Leopards, tigers, play  
Round her as she la y; 
While the lion old  
Bowed his mane of gold,  
And her bosom lick,  
And upon her neck,  
From his eyes of flame,  
Ruby tears there came;  
While the lioness  
Loosed he r slender dress,  
And naked they conveyed  
To caves the sleeping maid.

THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND  
All the night in woe  
Lyca’s pa rents go  
Over valleys deep,  
While the deserts weep.  
Tired and woe -begone,  
Hoarse with making moan,  
Arm in arm, seven days  
They traced the desert ways.  
Seven nights they sleep  
Among shadows deep,  
And dream they see their child  
Starved in desert wild.  
Pale through pathless ways  
The fancied image strays,  
Famished, wee ping, weak,  
With hollow piteous shriek.  
Rising from unrest,  
The trembling woman pressed  
With feet of weary woe;  
She could no further go.  
In his arms he bore  
Her, armed with sorrow sore;  
Till before their way  
A couching lion lay.  
Turning back was vain:  
Soon his heavy mane  
Bore them to the ground,  
Then he stalked around,  
Smelling to his prey;  
119 
 But their fears allay  
When he licks their hands,  
And silent by them stands.  
They look upon his eyes,  
Filled with deep surprise;  
And wondering behold  
A spirit armed in gold.  
On his head a crown,  
On his shoulders down  
Flowed his golden hair.  
Gone was all their care.  
‘Follow me,’ he said;  
‘Weep not for the maid;  
In my palace deep,  
Lyca lies asleep.’  
Then they followed  
Where the vision led,  
And saw their sleeping chil d 
Among tigers wild.  
To this day they dwell  
In a lonely dell,  
Nor fear the wolvish howl  
Nor the lion’s growl.

 THE SICK ROSE  
O rose, thou art sick!  
The invisible worm,  
That flies in the night,  
In the howling storm,  
Has found out thy bed  
Of crimson joy,  
And his dark  secret love  
Does thy life destroy.

Tiger, tiger, burning bright  
In the forests of the night,  
What immortal hand or eye  
Could frame thy fearfu l symmetry?  
In what distant deeps or skies  
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?  
On what wings dare he aspire?  
What the hand dare seize the fire?  
And what shoulder and what art  
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?  
And, when thy heart began to beat,  
What dread ha nd and what dread feet?  
What the hammer? what the chain?  
In what furnace was thy brain?  
What the anvil? what dread grasp  
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?  
When the stars threw down their spears,  
And watered he aven with their tears,  
Did He smile His work to see?  
Did He who made the lamb make thee?  
Tiger, tiger, burning bright

 In the forests of the night,  
What immortal hand or eye  
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

THE GARDEN OF LOVE  
I went to  the Garden of Love,  
And saw what I never had seen;  
A Chapel was built in the midst,  
Where I used to play on the green.  
And the gates of this Chapel were shut,  
And ‘Thou shalt not’ writ over the door;  
So I turn ed to the Garden of Love  
That so many sweet flowers bore.  
And I saw it was filled with graves,  
And tombstones where flowers should be;  
123 
 And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,  
And binding with briars my joys and desires.

THE LITTLE VAGABOND  
Dear mother, dear mother, the Church is cold;  
But the Alehouse is healthy, and pleasant, and warm.  
Besides, I can tell where I am used well;  
Such usage in heaven will  never do well.  
But, if at the Church they would give us some ale,  
And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,  
We’d sing and we’d pray all the livelong day,  
Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.  
Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing,  
And we’d be as happy as birds in the spring;  
And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,  
Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch.  
And God, like a father, rejoicing to see  
His children as pleasant and happy as He,  
Wou ld have no more quarrel w ith the Devil or the barrel,  
But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.

LONDON  
I wander through each chartered street,  
Near where th e chartered Thames does flow,  
A mark in every face I meet,  
Marks of weakness, marks of woe.  
In every cry of every man,  
In every infant’s cry of fear,  
In every voice, in every ban,  
The mind -forged manacles I hear:  
How the chimney -sweeper’s cry  
Every black ening church appals,  
And the hapless soldier’s sigh  
Runs in blood down palace -walls.  
But most, through midnight streets I hear  
How the youthful harlot’s curse  
Blasts the new -born infant’s tear,  
And blights with plagues the marriage hearse.

TEARS IN HEAVEN  
Written by Eric Clapton and Wil l Jennings – mourning the loss of a dear one  
Would you know my name  
If I saw you in heaven?  
Would it be the same  
If I saw you in heaven?  
I must be strong and carry on  
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven  
 
Would you hold my hand  
If I saw you in heave n? 
Would you help me stand  
If I saw you in heaven?  
I'll find my way through night and day  
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven  
 
Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees  
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, b egging please  
 
Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure  
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven  
 
Would you know my name  
If I saw you in heaven?  
Would it be the same  
If I saw you in heaven?  
I must be strong and carry on  
'Cause I know I don't belong her e in heaven

AND I LOVE YOU SO  
Written by Don McLean  
And I love you so  
The people ask me how  
How I've lived till now  
I tell them "I don't k now"  
 
I guess they unders tand  
How lonely life has been  
But life began again  
The day you took my hand  
 
And yes I know how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me  
And the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evening bring me down  
Now that you're arou nd me  
 
And you love me to o 
Your thoughts are just for me  
You set my spirit free  
I'm happy that you do  
 
The book of life is brief  
And once a page is read  
All but love is dead  
This is my belief

I COULD WRITE A BOOK1 
Written by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart  
If they ask me, I could write  a book  
About the way you walk and w hisper and look  
I could write a preface on how we met  
So the world would never forget  
 
And the simple secret of the plot  
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot  
Then the world discovers as my book ends  
How to make tw o lovers of friends

 KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH HIS SONG  
"Killing Me Softly with His Song " is a song composed by  Charles Fox  with lyrics by  Norman Gimbel  – go to youtube for 
the tune  
Strumming my  pain with his fingers  
Singing my life with his words  
Killing me softly with his song  
Killing me softly with his song  
Telling my whole life with his words  
Killing me softly w ith his song  
 
I heard he sang a good song  
I heard he had a style  
And so I came to see him  
To listen for a while  
And there he was this young boy  
A stranger to my eyes  
 
Strumming my pain with his fingers  
Singing my life with his words  
Killing me softly with his song  ... 
 
I felt all flushed with fever  
Embarassed by the crowd  
I felt he found my letters  
And read each one out loud  
I prayed that he would finish  
But he just kept right on  
 
Strumming my pain with his fingers  
Singing my life with his words  
Killing me softly with his song  ... 
 
He sang as if he knew me  
In all my dark despair  
And then he looked right through me  
As if I wasn't there  
And he just kept on singing  
Singing clear and strong  
 
Strumming my pain with his fingers  
Singing my life with his words  
Killing me softly with his song  ... 
 
He was strumming my pain  
Yeah, he was singing my life  
Killing me softly with his song  
Killing me softly with his song  
Telling my whole life with his words  
Killing me softly  with his song

Goodbye to you my tr usted friend  
We've known each other since we were nine or ten  
Together we climbed hills and trees  
Learned of love and A B C's  
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees.  
 
Goodbye my friend it's hard to d ie 
When all the birds are singing in the sky  
Now that t he spring is in the air  
Pretty girls are everywhere  
Think of me and I'll be there  
 
We had joy we had fun  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons  
Out of time...  
 
Goodby e Papa please pray for me  
I was the black sheep of the family  
You tried to teach me right from wrong  
Too much wine and too much song  
Wonder how I got along.  
 
Goodbye Papa its hard to die  
When all the birds are singing in the sky  
Now that the spring is in t he air  
Little children everywhere  
When you see them I'l l be there.  
 
We had joy we had fun  
132 
 We had seasons in the sun  
But the wine and the song like the seasons  
Have all gone.  
 
Goodbye Michelle my little one  
You gave me love and helped me find the sun  
And ev ery time that I was down  
You would always come around  
And get my feet back on the ground.  
 
Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die  
When all the birds are singing in the sky  
Now that the spring is in the air  
With the flowers everywhere  
I wish that we could both b e there  
 
We had joy we had fun  
We had seasons in the su n 
But the stars we could reach  
Were just starfish on the beach  
 
We had joy we had fun  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the wine and the song like the seasons  
Have all gone  
 
All our lives we had fun  
We had  seasons in the sun  
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons  
Out of time

 SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW  
Written by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg  
Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high  
There's a land that I heard of once in  a lullaby  
 
Somewhere, over the rainbo w, skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true  
 
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops  
That's where you'll find me  
 
Somewher e over the rainbow, bluebirds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then, oh why can't I?  
 
If happy little bluebirds fly  
Beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh why, can't I?  
LAO DERYER LARKANSIEL  
Lao deryer larkansiel, lwen laba  
Ena enn pei zoli kot zanfan san traka  
 
Lao deryer larkansiel, lesiel ble  
E bann rev nou pa per reve vinn laverite  
 
Enn zour mo pou mont lor zetwal  
Al abit kot bann niaz gri pa gagn drwa vini  
Kot traka fonn enn deryer lot  
Kan soley pe kares lakot  
Laba ki viv en n bon lavi  
 
Lao deryer larkansiel, get zwazo  
Ouver lezel tou kouler  
Kifer zot e pa mwa?  
Si zwazo konn anvole  
Lor ledo larkansiel  
Kifer pa mwa, kifer?

 STARRY STARRY NIGHT  
written by Don McLean - a tribute to Vincent van Gogh  – learn the tune on youtube  
Starry starry nignt  
Paint your palette blue and gray  
Look out on a summer's day  
With eyes that know  
The darkness in my soul  
Shadows on the hills  
Sketch the trees and the daffodils  
Catch the breeze and winter chills  
In colors on the snowy linen land  
Now I under stand  
What you tried to say to me  
How you suffered for your sanity  
How you tried to set them free  
They would not listen  
They did not know how  
Perhaps they'll listen now  
 
Starry starry night  
Flaming flowers that brightly laze  
Swirling clouds in violet haze  
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue  
Colors changing hue  
Morning fields of amber grain  
Weathered faces lined in pain  
Are soothed beneath  
The artist's loving hand  
 
Now I understand  
What you tried to say to me  
How you suffered for your sanity  
How you trie d to set them free  
They would not l isten  
They did not know how  
Perhaps they'll listen now  
 
For they could not love you  
But still your love was true  
And when no hope was  
Left in sight on that  
Starry starry night  
You took your life  
As lovers often do  
But I c ould have told you Vincent  
This wor ld was never meant  
For one as beautiful as you  
 
136 
 Starry starry night  
Portraits hung in empty halls  
Frameless heads on nameless walls  
With eyes that watch  
The world and can't forget  
Like the strangers that you've met  
The ra gged man in ragged clothes  
The silv er thorn of bloody rose  
Lie crushed and broken  
On the virgin snow  
 
Now I think I know  
What you tried to say to me  
How you suffered for your sanity  
How you tried to set them free  
They would not listen  
They're not listening  still 
Perhaps they never will

THOSE WERE THE DAYS  
English lyrics by Gene Raskin, based on a poem by Russian poet Konstantin Podrevsky  
Once upon a time there was a  tavern  
Wher e we used to raise a glass or two  
Remember how we laughed away the hours  
And dreamed of all the great things we would do  
Those were the days my friend  
We thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choos e 
138 
 We'd fight  and never lose  
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days  
La la la la...  
 
Then the busy years went rushing by us  
We lost our starry notions on the way  
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern  
We'd smile at one another and we'd say  
Those wer e the days m y friend  
We thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose  
We'd fight and never lose  
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days  
La la la la...  
 
Just tonight I stood before the tavern  
Nothing see med the way it used to be  
In the glass I saw a strange reflection  
Was that lonely woman really me  
Those were the days my friend  
We thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose  
We'd fight and never lose  
Those w ere the days , oh yes those were the days  
La la la la...  
 
Through the door there came familiar laughter  
I saw your face and heard you call my name  
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser  
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same  
Those were the days my f riend  
We tho ught they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose  
We'd fight and never lose  
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days  
La la la la...  
NOU LEPOK SA  
Rapel lontan dan nou tavern  
Kot nou ti tap detrwa ti grog  
Rapel k ouma san pran traka  
Ansam nou rev bann gran explwa  
Nou lepok sa mayfrenn

Mo louk andan, ki mo trouve  
To ti laba, to ti trouv mwa  
Nou vie aster me ankor fou  
Dan nou leker nou rev vivan  
Nou lepok sa mayfrenn  
Pa ti bizen fer senn  
Sante, dans e san okenn kalkile  
Nou viv kouma nou’anvi  
Pa per bann tilespri  
Nou lepok sa, wi ti nou lepok sa  
Tilalala tilahe tilala ti la...  
FOREVER AUTUMN  
written by Jeff Wayne, Gary Anthony Osborne and Paul Anthony Vigrass  
The summer sun is fading as the year grows old 
And darker days are drawing near  
The winter winds will be much colder  
Now you're not here.  
I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky  
140 
 And one by one they disappear.  
I wish that I was flying with them  
Now you're not here  
 
Like a song t hrough the trees you came to love me  
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away  
 
Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way  
You always loved this time of year.  
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now  
Cause you're not here  
 
Like a song through the trees you came to love me  
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away  
 
A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes  
As if to hide a lonely tear  
My life will be forever autumn  
'Cause you're not here!  
FRESER KI LA  
Freser rantre ler letan pe pase  
Marenwar koumans fe r vantar  
Labriz  glase pe trangle tibaba  
Twa to pa la, twa to pa la  
Get bann zwazo pe rod enn lot desten  
Enn par enn zot pe disparet  
Kifer mo pa kapav fer kouma zot  
Twa to pa la, twa to pa la  
 
Kouma enn fri mir lor pie to’nn donn to lamour

Malgre dif nou ti pe trase  ansam  
Toufann zame ti fer tike  
Aster tousel ki mo bizen fer fas  
Twa to pa la, twa to pa la  
 
Kouma enn fri mir lor pie to’nn donn to lamour  
Me divan feros finn zet twa dan lakour  
 
Lapli glase pe aroz mo lizie 
Pou kasiet ne t mo gran sagren  
Aster partou freser ki la  
Twa to pa la, twa to pa la  
Twa to pa la, twa to pa la  
Twa to pa la, twa to pa la

 NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN  
 written by  Justin Hayward  
Nights in white satin  
Never reaching the end  
Letters I've writte n 
Never meaning to send  
 
Beauty I'd always missed  
With these eyes before  
Just what the truth is  
I can't say any more  
 
'Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
 
Gazing at people, some hand in hand  
Just what I'm going through they can't understand  
Some try to tell me , thoughts they cannot defend  
Just what you want to be, you will be in the end  
 
And I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
Oh how I love you  
 
Nights in white satin  
Never reaching the end  
Letters I've written  
Never meaning to send  
 
Beauty I've always m issed  
With these eyes before  
Just what the truth is  
I can't say any more  
'Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
Oh how I love you  
'Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
Oh how I love you

A WHITER SHADE  OF PALE  
written by Keith Reid  
We skipped a light fandango  
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor  
I was feeling kinda seasick  
The crowd called out for more  
The room was humming harder  
As the ceiling flew away  
When w e called out for another drink  
The waiter brought a tray  
And so it was that later  
As the miller told his tale  
That her face, at first just ghostly  
Turned a whiter shade of pale  
143 
  
She said, "There is no reason  
And the tr uth is plain to see"  
But I wandered th rough my playing cards  
And would not let her be  
One of sixteen vestal virgins  
Who were leaving for the coast  
And although my eyes were open  
They might just as well have been closed  
 
 And so it was that later  
As the mil ler told his tale  
That her face, at fi rst just ghostly  
Turned a whiter shade of pale  
ENN TON PAL PLI PAL KI PAL  
Nou tras bann pa zoli sega  
Tous sali, balans parsi  
Lespri tourdi, vire tourne  
Ankor, ankor dimoun rode  
Bourdonnman dir mwa ki la  
Ler plafon koum ans anvole  
Nou tou dimann ranpli nou v er 
Weyter amenn plato soma  
E enn timama apre  
Ler Baissac dir so zistwar  
Figir mo minn lerla li vinn  
Enn ton pal pli pal ki pal  
 
Mo minn dir mwa, “Peyna lozik  
Laverite pa fer koustik”  
Me mo lespri al vakarne  
Pou anpes l i vinn enn  
Parmi sa sez vierz sakre  
Ki ti pe al dan borlamer  
Mem mo lizie ti pe gete  
Peyna nanye mo ti trouve  
 
E enn timama apre  
Ler Baissac dir so zistwar  
Figir mo minn lerla li vinn  
Enn ton pal pli pal ki pal  
ANNIE’S SONG  
written by John Denver  
You fill up my senses  
Like a night in a forest  
Like the mountains in springtime  
Like a walk in the rain  
144 
 Like a storm in the desert  
Like a sleepy blue ocean  
You fill up my senses  
Come fill me again  
 
Come let me love you  
Let me give my life to you  
Let me drown i n your laughter  
Let me die in your arms  
Let me lay down beside you  
Let me always be with you  
Come let me love you  
Come love me again  
 
Let me give my life to you  
Come let me love you  
Come love me again  
 
You fill up my senses  
Like a night in a forest  
Like th e mountains in springtime  
Like a walk in th e rain  
Like a storm in the desert  
Like a sleepy blue ocean  
You fill up my senses  
Come fill me again

THE WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND  
written by Alan Bergman, Michel Jean Legrand,  
Round li ke a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel  
Never ending or beginning on an ever -spinning reel  
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon  
Like a carousel that's turning running ring s around the moon  
Like a clock whose hands are sweepin g past the minutes on its face  
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space  
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind  
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its ow n 
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never sh one 
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half -forgotten dream  
Like the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream  
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on its face  
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space  
Like the c ircles that you find in the windmills of your mind  
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head  
Why did summer go so quickly?  
Was it something that you said?  
Lovers walk along a shor e and leave their footprints in the sand  
Was the sound  of distant drumming Just the fingers of your hand?  
 
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song  
Half-remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?  
When you knew that it was over were you suddenly aware  
That the autumn leaves were tu rning to the colour of her hair!  
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel  
Never ending or beginning on an ever -spinning reel  
As the images unwind  
Like the circles that you find in the wind mills of your mind

WHERE DO YOU GO TO MY LOVELY  
written by Peter Sarstedt  
You talk like Marlène Dietrich  
And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire  
Your clothes are all made by Balmain  
And there's diamonds and pearls in your hair, yes there are  
 
You live in  a fancy apartment  
Off the Boulevard Saint -Michel  
Where you keep your Rolling Stones records  
And a friend of Sacha Distel, yes you do  
 
But where do you go to my lovely  
When you're alone in your bed  
Tell me the thoughts that surround you  
I want to look insi de your head, yes I do  
 
I've seen all your qualification s 
You got from the Sorbonne  
And the painting you stole from Picasso  
Your loveliness goes on and on, yes it does  
 
When you go on your summer vacation you go to Juan -les-Pins 
With your carefully designe d topless swimsuit  
You get an even sun tan, on your back  and on your legs  
 
When the snow falls you're found in Saint Moritz  
With the others of the jet -set 
And you sip your Napoleon brandy  
But you never get your lips wet, no you don't  
147 
 But where do you go t o my lovely  
When you're alone in your bed  
Won't you tell  me the thoughts that surround you  
I want to look inside your head, yes I do  
 
Your name, it is heard in high places  
You know the Aga Khan  
He sent you a racehorse for Christmas  
And you keep it just for  fun, for a laugh ahaha  
 
They say that when you get marr ied 
It'll be to a millionaire  
But they don't realise where you came from  
And I wonder if they really care or give a damn  
 
Where do you go to my lovely  
When you're alone in your bed  
Tell me the thought s that surround you  
I want to look inside your head, yes  I do 
 
I remember the back streets of Naples  
Two children begging in rags  
Both touched with a burning ambition  
To shake off their lowly born tags, and they try  
 
So look into my face, Marie -Claire  
And remember just who you are  
Then go and forget me forever  
But I know you still bear the scar deep inside,  
 
I know where you go to my lovely  
When you're alone in your bed  
I know the thoughts that surround you  
Cause I can look inside your head

BLOWIN' IN THE WIND  AN MORISIEN  
(©BOB DYLAN)  
How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you call him a man  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand  
Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly  
Before they're forever banned  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' i n the wind  
 
Yes, 'n' how many years can a mountain exist  
Before it' s washed to the sea  
Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist  
Before they're allowed to be free  
Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head  
And pretend that he just doesn't see  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind  
 
Yes, 'n' how many times must a man look up  
Before he can see the sky  
Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry  
Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take t ill he knows  
That too many people have died  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind

GREENSLEEVES  
Alas, my love, you do me wrong,  
To cast me off discourteously.  
For I have loved you well and long,  
Delighting in your company.  
  
Greensleeves was all my joy  
Greensleeves was my delight,  
Greensleeves was my heart of go ld, 
And who but my lady greensleeves.  
  
Your vows you've broken, like my heart,  
Oh, why did you so enrapture me?  
Now I remain in a world apart  
But my heart remains in captivity.  
  
 I have been ready at your hand,  
To grant whatever you would crave,  
I have b oth wagered life and land,  
Your love and good -will for to have.  
   
If you intend thus to disdain,  
It does the more enrapture me,  
And even so, I still remain  
A lover in captivity.  
   
My men were clothed all in green,  
And they did ever wait on thee;  
All this  was gallant to be seen,  
And yet thou wouldst not love me.  
   
Thou couldst desire no earthly thing,  
but still thou hadst it readily.  
Thy music still to play and sing;  
And yet thou wouldst not love me.  
   
Well, I will pray to God on high,  
151 
 that thou my const ancy mayst see,  
And that yet once before I die,  
Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me.  
   
Ah, Greensleeves, now farewell, adieu,  
To God I pray to prosper thee,  
For I am still thy lover true,  
Come once again and love me.

IF I HAD A HAMMER  
(written by Pete Seeger and Lee Hays)  
If I had a hammer,  
I'd hammer in the morning,  
I'd hammer in the evening,  
All over this land,  
I'd hammer out danger,  
I'd hammer out a warning,  
I'd hammer out love between,  
My brothers and my sisters,  
All over this land.  
 
If I had a bell,  
I'd ring it in the morning,  
I'd ring it in the evening,  
All over this land,

I'd ring out a warning,  
I'd ring out love between,  
My brothers and my sisters,  
All o ver this land.  
 
If I had a song   
I'd sing it in the morning   
I'd sing it in the evening   
All over this land   
It's a song of danger  
It's a song of warning  
It's a song about love between   
My brothers and  my sisters   
All over this land.  
 
Well, I've got a hamm er  
And I've got a bell   
And I've got a song to sing   
All over this land   
It's the hammer of justice   
It's the bell of freedom   
It's a song about love between   
My b rothers and my sisters   
All over this land .

LEMON TREE  
written by Will Holt; sung by Peter, Paul and Mary  
When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me  
"Come here  and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree"  
"Don't put your faith in love, my boy" my father said to me  
"I fear you'l l find that love is like the lovely lemon tree"  
 
Lemon tree, very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet  
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat  
Lemon tree, very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet  
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossibl e to eat  
 
One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie  
A girl so sweet that when she smiled, the stars rose in the sky  
We passe d that summer lost in love, beneath the lemon tree  
The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me  
 
Lemon tree, very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet  
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat  
Lemon tree, very pretty, and the lemon f lower is sweet  
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat  
 
One day she left without a word, she took away the sun  
And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had done  
156 
 She left me for another, it's a common tale but true  
A sadder man, but wis er now, I sing these words to you  
Lemon tree, very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet  
But the fruit of the poor l emon is impossible to eat  
Lemon tree, very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet  
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

MARY DON’T YOU WEEP  –  
written and sung by Bruce Springsteen  
Well if I could I surely would  
Stand on the rock where Moses stood;  
Pharaoh's army got drownded -  
O Mary don't you weep.  
 
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mourn,  
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mourn,  
Pharaoh's army got drownded -  
O Mary don't you weep.  
157 
  
Well Mary wore three links and chains -  
On every link was Jesus' nam e; 
Pharaoh's army got drownded - 
O Mary don't you weep.  
 
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mourn,  
O Mary d on't you weep, don't you mourn,  
Pharaoh's army got drownded - 
O Mary don't weep.  
 
Well one of these nights bout 12 o'clock  
This old world is gonna rock ; 
Pharaoh's army got drownded - 
O Mary don't you weep.  
 
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mourn,  
O Mary do n't you weep, don't you mourn,  
Pharaoh's army got drownded -  
O Mary don't you weep.  
 
Well Moses stood on the Red Sea shore,  
Smote' the water with a tw o by four;  
Pharaoh's army got drownded - 
O Mary don't you weep  
 
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mourn,  
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mourn,  
Pharaoh's army got drownded - 
O Mary don't you weep.  
 
Well old Mr. Satan, he got mad,  
Missed that soul that he t hought he had;  
Pharaoh's army got drownded - 
O Mary don't you weep.  
 
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mou rn, 
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mourn,  
Pharaoh's army got drownded -  
O Mary don't you weep.  
 
Brothers and sisters don't you cry - 
There'll be goo d times by and by;  
Pharaoh's army got drownded - 
O Mary don't weep.  
 
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mou rn, 
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mourn,  
Pharaoh's army got drownded -  
O Mary don't you weep.  
 
God gave Noah the rainbow sign;  
"No more water but f ire next time";  
158 
 Pharaoh's army got drownded - 
O Mary don't you weep.  
 
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mo urn, 
O Mary don't you weep, don't you mourn,  
Pharaoh's army got drownded - 
O Mary don't you weep.

 Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane.  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme  
Gather it up in a basket of flowers  
Then she'll be a true love of mine  
 
Have he r wash it in yonder dry well  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme  
Where water ne'er sprung, nor drop of rain fell.  
Then she'll be a true love of mine  
 
Tell her to to find me an acre o f land.  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme  
Between the sea foam and over the sand.  
Then she'll be a true love of mine  
 
Plow the land with the horn of a lamb.  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme  
Then sow some seeds from north of the dam.  
Then she'll be a true love of mine  
 
Have her reap it with a sickle of leather.  
Parsley, sage, rose mary and thyme  
Gather it up in a bunch of heather.  
Then she'll be a true love of mine  
 
When thou have finished thy task.  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme

For then you'll be a true love of mine

SUZANNE   
©Leonard Cohen  
Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river  
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night beside her  
And you know that she's half -crazy but that's why you want to be there  
And she feeds you tea and ora nges that come all the way from China  
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her  
Then she gets you on her wavelength  
And she lets the river answer that you've always  been her lover  
 
And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind  
And you know that she will trust you  
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind  
 
And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water  
And he spent a long time watching f rom his lonely wooden tower  
And when he knew for certain o nly drowning men could see him  
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them  
But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open  
Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath yo ur wisdom like a stone  
 
And you want to travel with him, a nd you want to travel blind  
And you think you maybe you'll trust him  
For he's touched your perfect body with h is mind  
 
Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river  
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters  
And the sun pour s down like honey on our lady of the harbor  
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers  
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning  
They are leaning out for love and they wil l lean that way forever  
While Suzanne  holds her mirror  
 
162 
 And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind  
And you know that you can trust her  
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind

Sizann trap to lame, ame nn twa dan bor dilo  
Bann bato monte -desann, to’anvi lanwit san defo  
To kone li enpe toke, akoz sa to pa pou larg li  
Li donn twa dite ek zoranz ki sorti depi Lasinn  
Zis kouma to pou al dir li ki peyna lamour pou li  
Li reysi vir to lespri  
Les larivier reponn  ki to toultan ti so koko -seri 
 
Lerla to anvi roule,  reve san ezite  
To sir li kapav kwar twa  
Parski to’nn tous so bote ar to nam  
 
Nou Zezi ti enn bon maren ler li ti mars lor lamer  
E pas boukou letan get lavi dan nou liniver  
E ler li ti bien konpran ki zis  peser ti trouv li  
Li dir nou tou vinn maren ziska k i lamer larg nou  
Me limem li ti dan pens avan ki lesiel ouver  
Tousel, abandone, li koule net dan to sazes manter  
 
Lerla to anvi roule, reve san ezite  
To sir to kapav kwar li  
Parski li’nn tous to bote ar s o nam  
 
Sizann trap to lame, amenn twa kot larivier  
Get kouma li atiran, li konn abiy dan lamanier  
Soley vers so douser lor Marie Reine de La Paix  
Li montre twa sime parmi petal ek pikan  
Ena ero anba dilo ek zanfan dan gramaten  
Ki pe rod lamour paran zordi,  dime, touletan  
Pandan ki Sizann get dan l aglas  
 
Lerla to anvi roule, reve san ezite  
To sir to kapav kwar li  
Parski li’nn tous to bote ar so nam

 THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND   
Words and Music by Woody Guthrie  
This land is your land This land is my land  
From Calif ornia to the New York island;   
From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters   
This land was made for you and Me.  
 
As I was walking that ribbon of highway,   
I saw above me that endless skyway:   
I saw below me that golden valley:   
This land was made for  you and me.  
 
I've roamed and rambled an d I followed my footsteps   
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts;   
And all around me a voice was sounding:   
This land was made for you and me.  
 
When the sun came shining, and I was strolling,   
And the wheat f ields waving and the dust clouds rolling ,  
As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting:   
This land was made for you and me.  
 
As I went walking I saw a sign there   
And on the sign it said "No Trespassing."   
But on the other side it didn't say nothing,   
That  side was made for you and me.  
 
In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,   
By the relief office I seen my people;   
As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking   
Is this land made for you and me?  
 
Nobody living can ever stop me,   
As I go walking tha t freedom highway;   
Nobody livin g can ever make me turn back   
This land was made for you and me.

Lor sime partaz, lamour, liberte.  
Personn pa kapav fer mwa  kil parad.

YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE  
written by Jimmie Davis  
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping  
I dreamed I held you in my arms  
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken  
So I hung my head and I cried  
 
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  
You make me happy when skies are gray  
You'll never know dear, how much I love you  
Please don't take my suns hine away  
168 
  
I'll always love you and make you happy  
If you will only say the same  
But if you leave me and love another  
You'll regret it all some day  
 
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  
You make me happy when skies are gray  
You'll never know dear, how muc h I love you  
Please don't take my sunshine away  
 
You told me once, dear, you really loved me  
And no one else could come between  
But now you've left me and love another  
You have shattered all of my dreams  
 
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  
You make me happy when skies are gray  
You'll never know dear, how much I love you  
Please don't take my sunshine away  
In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me  
When I awake my poor heart pains  
So when you come back and make me happy  
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame  
 
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  
You make me happy when skies are gray  
You'll never know dear, how much I love you  
Please don't take my sunshine away

THE FOUNTAIN  
This hard road is mighty long  
This long road is mighty hard  
How many are they who’ve trodden it s dust  
Fiery darts are in the sky  
Choking dust is in my mouth  
And my throat narrows down to a gasp  
The fresh fountain's miles ahead  
All so clear, all so cool  
That's where we'll all drink our joy  
 
Graveyard's full of pretty flowers  
Where pals lay down their arms  
The road goes by the  burial ground  
My life's just a speck of dust  
Which seeks sleep in a graveyard  
But hope will not blow out its light  
For each light which does go out  
Thousands will kindle new hope  
Showing the way to the fountain  
 
Darkness tries to gobble me  
The swamp tries  to swal low me  
Some pals and I are huddling through  
But tomorrow who'll be there  
When the sun sucks in the swamp  
Who's not buried in petals  
Some are gone who once were here  
Now only a memory  
Memory that’s heavy on my heart  
 
171 
 We must all clear out a path  
We must all  build out bridges  
Step by step towards the fresh fountain  
Even if we don't get there  
Our children surely will  
For dust will turn into light  
The fresh fountain's miles ahead  
All so clear, all so cool  
That's where we'll all drink our joy
