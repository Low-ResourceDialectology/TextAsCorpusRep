You received without paying, now give without being paid.
Workers deserve their food.
But if the home isn't deserving, take back your blessing of peace.
And shake the dust from your feet at them.
So be as wise as snakes and as innocent as doves.
At that time you will be given the words to say.
You will not really be the one speaking.

Everyone will hate you because of me.
When people ill-treat you in one town, hurry to another one.

People who dress like that live in the king's palace.
What did you really go out to see?
Was he a prophet?
He certainly was.
I tell you that he was more than a prophet.
I tell you that no one ever born on this earth is greater than John the Baptist.

Yes, Father, that is what pleased you.
The only one who truly knows the Father is the Son.
I am gentle and humble, and you will find rest.
A question about the Sabbath.
They are not supposed to do that.
Jesus answered:
You must have read what David did when he and his followers were hungry.
He went into the house of God, and then they ate the sacred loaves of bread that only priests are supposed to eat.
Haven't you read in the Law of Moses that the priests are allowed to work in the temple on the Sabbath?
So the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath.

Then Jesus told the man, hold out your hand.
Jesus is God's servant.
Here is my chosen servant.

Sign from heaven.
But Jesus replied:
You want a sign because you are evil and won't believe.
That's how it will be with you evil people of today.
Jesus' family.
A story about a farmer.
Then he taught them many things by using stories, he said:
A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field.
If you have ears, pay attention.
Why Jesus used stories?
Jesus' disciples came to him and asked, why do you use nothing but stories when you speak to the people?
Everyone who has something will be given more.
These people will listen and listen,but never understand.
They will look and look, but never see.
All of them have stubborn minds.
Their ears are stopped up, and their eyes are covered.
They cannot see or hear or understand.
Jesus explains the story about the farmer.
Now listen to the meaning of the story about the farmer.
So the message gets choked out, and they never produce anything.
Story of bad weeds.
Jesus then told them this story:
Where did these weeds come from?
An enemy did this, he replied.
Allow both to grow together until harvest time.
Stories about mustard seed.
Jesus told them another story:
Story of yeast.
Jesus used stories when he spoke to the people.
In fact, he did not tell them anything without using stories.
Jesus explains the story about the weeds.

Story of treasure.
A valuable pearl.

How can he do all this?
The death of John the Baptist.
Herod wanted to kill John.
Then they told Jesus what had happened.
Jesus feeds five thousand men.
When Jesus got out of the boat, he saw the large crowd.
He felt sorry for them and healed everyone who was sick.
Jesus replied, why should they leave.
Why don't you give them something to eat?
Jesus walks on water.
But he stayed until he had sent the crowds away.
Later that evening, he was still there.
By this time the boat was a long way from the shore.
When they saw him, they thought he was a ghost.
They were terrified and started screaming.
Have no fear.
Come on, Jesus said.
Save me, Lord, he shouted.
Straight away, Jesus reached out his hand.
He helped Peter up and said, you don't have much faith, why do you doubt?
The men in the boat worshipped Jesus and said, you really are the Son of God?
Jesus heals sick people in Gennesaret.
The people found out that he was there, and they sent word to everyone who lived in that part of the country.

The teaching of the ancestors.
They don't even wash their hands before they eat.
Didn't God command you to respect your father and mother?
Didn't he tell you to put to death all who curse their parents?
You let them say that what they have has been offered to God.
Is this any way to show respect to your parents?
And you are nothing but show-offs, Isaiah the prophet was right when he wrote that God had said.
It is useless for you to worship me, when you teach rules made up by humans.
What really makes us unclean.
The food that you put into your mouth doesn't make you unclean.
Stay away from those Pharisees.
Jesus said:
Don't any of you know what I am talking about by now?
These are what make you unclean.
A woman's faith.
My daughter is full of demons.
Jesus did not say a word.
They are like a flock of lost sheep.
The woman came closer.
At that moment her daughter was healed.
Jesus heals many people.
From there, Jesus went along Lake Galilee.
Then he climbed a hill and sat down.
They placed them in front of Jesus, and he healed them all.
People who had never spoken could now speak.
Then they started praising the God of Israel.
I don't want to send them away hungry.
They might faint on their way home.
His disciples said, this place is like a desert.
Where can we find enough food to feed such a crowd?
Jesus asked them how much food they had.
They replied, seven small loaves of bread and a few little fish.
Everyone ate all they wanted, and the leftovers filled seven large baskets.
He came to shore near the town of Magadan.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tried to test him.
He told them:
You can tell what the weather will be like by looking at the sky.
But you don't understand what is happening now.
Then Jesus left.
The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Jesus then warned them, watch out.
Guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The disciples talked this over and said to each other, he must be saying this because we didn't bring along any bread.
You don't have much faith.
Why are you talking about not having any bread?
Don't you understand?
Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then Jesus asked them, but who do you say I am?
Simon Peter spoke up, you are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.
Simon, son of Jonah, you are blessed.
You didn't discover this on your own.
It was shown to you by my Father in heaven.
So I will call you Peter, which means a rock.
Jesus speaks about his suffering and death.
He said, I must go to Jerusalem.
Then Jesus said to his disciples:
You must take up your cross and follow me.
If you want to save your life, you will destroy it.
But if you give up your life for me, you will find it.
What would you give to get back your soul?
The true glory of Jesus.
They went up on a very high mountain where they could be alone.
There in front of the disciples, Jesus was completely changed.
From the cloud a voice said, this is my own dear Son, and I am pleased with him.
Listen to what he says.
But Jesus came over and touched them.
He said, get up and don't be afraid.
When they opened their eyes, they saw only Jesus.
In fact, he has already come.
They will soon make the Son of Man suffer in the same way.
Jesus heals a boy.
Jesus and his disciples returned to the crowd.
Jesus said, you people are too stubborn to have any faith.
How much longer must I be with you?
Why do I have to put up with you?
Bring the boy here.
It is because you don't have enough faith.
But I can promise you this.
And it would.
Everything would be possible for you.
Jesus again speaks about his death.
Temple tax.
Does your teacher pay the temple tax?
Yes, he does, Peter answered.
After they had returned home, Jesus went up to Peter and asked him, Simon, what do you think?
Do the kings of this earth collect taxes and fees from their own people or from foreigners?
Peter answered, from foreigners?
But we don't want to cause trouble.
So go and cast a line into the lake and pull out the first fish you hook.
Use it to pay your taxes and mine.
Who is the greatest?
Then he said:
I promise you this.
There will always be something to cause people to sin, but anyone who does this will be in for trouble.
If your eye causes you to sin, poke it out and get rid of it.
The lost sheep.
Don't be cruel to any of these little ones.
Let me ask you this.
Wouldn't you leave the ninety-nine on the hillside and go and look for the one that had wandered away?
That's how it is with your Father in heaven.
A brother who sins.
If the follower refuses to listen to them, report the matter to the church.
An official who refused to forgive.
Up to seven times?
Jesus answered:
Not just seven times, but seventy-seven times.
This story will show you what the kingdom of heaven is like:
The king felt sorry for him and let him go free.
He even told the official that he did not have to pay back the money.
So he grabbed the man by the neck.
But he refused.
When some other officials found out what had happened, they felt sorry for the man who had been put in jail.
Then they told the king what had happened.
The king called the first official back in and said, you're an evil man.
Some Pharisees wanted to test Jesus.
He becomes like one person with his wife.
No one should separate a couple that God has joined together.
Jesus replied, you are so heartless.
But from the beginning God did not intend it to be that way.
If you do, you are unfaithful.
Jesus told them, only those people who have been given the gift of staying single can accept this teaching.
Others stay single for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.
Anyone who can accept this teaching should do so.
Jesus blesses little children.
His disciples told the people to stop bothering him.
People who are like these children belong to God's kingdom.
A rich young man.
Only God is good.
If you want to have eternal life, you must obey his commandments.
Which ones?
The man asked.
Jesus answered, do not murder.
Do not steal.
Do not tell lies about others.
Respect your father and mother.
Love others as much as you love yourself.
The young man said, I have obeyed all these.
What else must I do?
Then come and be my follower.
What will we get?
Jesus answered:
Yes, all of you have become my followers.
They will also have eternal life.
Workers in a vineyard.
Early one morning a man went out to hire some workers for his vineyard.
So they went.
Because no one has hired us, they answered.
Then he told them to go and work in his vineyard.
He also told the man to begin with the ones who were hired last.
But when they were given the same, they began complaining to the owner of the vineyard.
But you paid them the same that you did us.
And we worked in the hot sun all day long.
I paid you exactly what we agreed on.
Take your money now and go.
What business is it of yours if I want to pay them the same that I paid you?
Why should you be jealous, if I want to be generous?
Jesus then said, so it is.
Everyone who is now first will be last, and everyone who is last will be first.
Jesus talkss about his death a third time.
They will beat him and nail him to a cross.
But on the third day he will rise from death.
James and Jon's mother ask for a favour.
Jesus asked her what she wanted?
Jesus answered, not one of you knows what you are asking.
Are you able to drink from the cup that I must soon drink from?
They said, yes, we can.
That is for my Father to say.
But Jesus called the disciples together and said:
You know that foreign rulers like to order their people around.
But don't act like them.
Jesus was followed by a large crowd as he and his disciples were leaving Jericho.
Two blind men were sitting beside the road.
When Jesus heard them, he stopped and asked, what do you want me to do for you?
They answered, Lord, we want to see.
Jesus felt sorry for them and touched their eyes.
Straight away they could see, and they became his followers.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
Untie the two donkeys and bring them to me.
Straight away he will let you have the donkeys.
Announce to the people of Jerusalem:
Your king is coming to you.
He is humble and rides on a donkey.
Then Jesus got on.
They were all shouting.
Hooray for the Son of David.
The crowd answered, this is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.
Jesus in the temple.
But you have turned it into a place where robbers hide.
Yes, I do, Jesus answered.
Don't you know that the Scriptures say:
Jesus puts a curse on a fig tree.
When Jesus got up the next morning, he was hungry.
At once the fig tree dried up.
And you will be able to do even more.
If you have faith when you pray, you will be given whatever you ask for.
A question about Jesus' authority.
Who gave you this authority?
Who gave John the right to baptize?
Jesus will ask us why we didn't believe John.
So they told Jesus, we don't know.
A story about two sons.
Then you can tell me what you think.
The man then told his younger son to go and work in the vineyard.
The elder one, the chief priests and leaders answered.
Then Jesus told them:
But these evil people did believe.
The story of bad workers.
Jesus told the chief priests and leaders to listen to this story:
He also built a lookout tower.
But the tenants grabbed those servants.
He then sent more servants than he did the first time.
But the tenants treated them in the same way.
Finally, the owner sent his own son to the tenants, because he thought they would respect him.
But when they saw the man's son, they said, some day he will own the vineyard.
Let's kill him.
Then we can have it all for ourselves.
Jesus asked, when the owner of that vineyard comes, what do you suppose he will do to those tenants?
Jesus replied, surely you know that the Scriptures say,
This is something.
It is amazing to our eyes.
So they looked for a way to arrest Jesus.
Once again Jesus used stories to teach the people:
Everything is ready.
Come to the banquet.
But the guests did not pay any attention.
And the banquet room was filled with guests.
But the guest had no excuse.
Many are invited, but only a few are chosen.
You teach the truth about what God wants people to do.
Tell us what you think.
Should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not?
Let me see one of the coins used for paying taxes.
The Emperor's, they answered.
His answer surprised them so much that they walked away.
The Sadducees did not believe that people would rise to life after death.
The first one married, but died without having any children.
So his wife was left to his brother.
At last the woman died.
When God raises people from death, whose wife will this woman be?
She had been married to all seven brothers.
Jesus answered:
You are completely wrong.
You don't know what the Scriptures teach and you don't know anything about the power of God.
They will be like the angels in heaven.
He isn't the God of the dead, but of the living.
The most important commandment.
One of them was an expert in the Jewish Law.
So he tried to test Jesus.
Jesus answered:
This is the first and most important commandment.
The second most important commandment is like this one.
Love others as much as you love yourself.
Question on David's son.
Whose family will he come from?
They answered, He will be a son of King David.
If David called the Messiah his Lord, how can the Messiah be a son of King David?
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses
Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:
After all, they say one thing and do something else.
Everything they do is just to show off in front of others.
But none of you should be called a teacher.
Don't call anyone on earth your father.
All of you have the same Father in heaven.
None of you should be called the leader.
The Messiah is your only leader.
You Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses are in for trouble.
You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven.
You are in for trouble.
You are supposed to lead others, but you are blind.
You blind fools.
Are you blind?
You Pharisees and teachers are show-offs, and you're in for trouble.
You Pharisees and teachers are nothing but show-offs, and you're in for trouble.
That's what you are like.
So keep on doing everything they did.
You are nothing but snakes and the children of snakes.
How can you escape going to hell?
Jesus loves Jerusalem.
But you wouldn't let me.
And now your temple will be deserted.
You won't see me again until you say, blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.
Destruction of the temple.
Jesus replied, do you see these buildings?
They will certainly be torn down.
Not one stone will be left in place.
Warning about trouble.
What will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world?
Don't let anyone fool you.
Many will come and claim to be me.
These things will have to happen first, but that isn't the end.
Nations and kingdoms will go to war against each other.
People will starve to death, and in some places there will be earthquakes.
But this is just the beginning of troubles.
You will be arrested, punished, and even killed.
Because of me, you will be hated by people of all nations.
Many false prophets will come and fool a lot of people.
Evil will spread and cause many people to stop loving their friends.
But if you keep on being faithful right to the end, you will be saved.
Everyone who reads this must try to understand.
If you are on the roof of your house, don't go inside to get anything.
And pray that you won't have to escape in winter or on a Sabbath.
Someone may say, here is the Messiah  or there he is.
Don't believe him.
They will even try to fool God's chosen ones.
But I have warned you beforehand.
If you are told that the Messiah is out in the desert, don't go there.
Where there is a corpse, there will always be vultures.
When the Son of Man appears
Then a sign will appear in the sky; and there will be the Son of Man.
A lesson from a fig tree.
Learn a lesson from a fig tree.
No one knows the day or hour.
The angels in heaven don't know, and the Son himself doesn't know.
Only the Father knows.
That is how it will be when the Son of Man appears.
The other will be left.
The other will be left.
So be on your guard.
You don't know when your Lord will come.
This is why, you also, must be ready.
You don't know when the Son of Man will come.
Faithful and unfaithful servants.
A story about ten girls.
Our lamps are going out.
Go and buy some for yourselves.
But the groom replied, I don't even know you.
So, my disciples, always be ready.
The man knew what each servant could do.
Then he left the country.
Some time later the master of those servants returned.
Wonderful, his master replied.
You are a good and faithful servant.
Come and share in my happiness.
Here is every single coin.
The master of the servant told him, you are lazy and good-for-nothing.
You know that I harvest what I don't plant and gather crops where I haven't scattered seed.
The final judgment.
You are under God's curse.
Then Jesus said, those people will be punished for ever.
But the ones who pleased God will have eternal life.
Jesus was in the town of Bethany, eating at the home of Simon, who had leprosy.
Why are you bothering this woman?
She has done a beautiful thing for me.
And they will tell others.
Judas Iscariot was one of the twelve disciples.
Jesus eats the Passover meal with his disciples.
The Son of Man will die, as the Scriptures say.
But it's going to be terrible for the one who betrays me.
That man would be better off if he had never been born.
Judas said, teacher, surely you don't mean me.
That's what you say, Jesus replied.
Jesus's supper.
He blessed the bread and broke it.
This is my body.
Jesus picked up a cup of wine and gave thanks to God.
I will strike down the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered.
All the others said the same thing.
Stay here and keep awake with me.
Jesus walked on a little way.
Stay awake and pray that you won't be tested.
You want to do what is right, but you are weak.
Jesus came back and found them sleeping again.
They simply could not keep their eyes open.
Finally, Jesus returned to his disciples and said, are you still sleeping and resting?
Get up, let's go.
The one who will betray me is already here.
Jesus is arrested.
Jesus was still speaking, when Judas the betrayer came up.
He was one of the twelve disciples.
Then Judas kissed him.
Jesus replied, my friend, why are you here?
The men grabbed Jesus and arrested him.
One of Jesus' followers pulled out a sword and he struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
But Jesus told him, put your sword away.
Anyone who lives by fighting will die by fighting.
But then, how could the words of the Scriptures come true, which say that this must happen?
But all this happened, so that what the prophets wrote would come true.
All Jesus' disciples left him and ran away.
Jesus iin front of a big council.
But they could not find any, even though many did come and tell lies.
The high priest stood up and asked Jesus, why don't you say something in your own defence?
Don't you hear the charges they are making against you?
But Jesus did not answer.
Tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of God?
That is what you say, Jesus answered.
We don't need any more witnesses.
You have heard what he said.
What do you think?
They answered, he is guilty and deserves to die.
So tell us who hit you.
Peter says he doesn't know Jesus.
But in front of everyone Peter said, that isn't so.
I don't know what you are talking about.
We can tell it because you talk like someone from Galilee.
Jesus in front of Pilate.
What do you want us to do?
That's your problem, they replied.
We can't put it in the temple treasury.
Then they had a meeting and decided to buy a field that belonged to someone who made clay pots.
They wanted to use it as a graveyard for foreigners.
That's why people still call that place field of Blood.
So the words of the prophet Jeremiah came true.
Pilate questions Jesus.
Those are your words, Jesus answered.
The death sentence of Jesus.
Do you want Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?
It said, don't have anything to do with that innocent man because at night I have had nightmares because of him.
Barabbas, they replied.
They all yelled, nail him to a cross.
Pilate answered, but what crime has he done?
Nail him to a cross, they yelled even louder.
You are the ones doing it.
Pilate set Barabbas free.
Soldiers make fun of Jesus.
They made fun of him and shouted.
Hey, you king of the Jews.
Then they spat on him.
Jesus is nailed to a cross.
On the way they met a man from Cyrene named Simon.
They forced him to carry Jesus' cross.
They came to a place named Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull.
But when Jesus tasted what it was, he refused to drink it.
Then they sat down to guard him.
This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.
People who passed by said terrible things about Jesus.
Then we will believe him.
The two criminals also said cruel things to Jesus.
The death of Jesus.
At midday the sky turned dark and stayed that way until three o'clock.
which means, My God, my God, why have you deserted me?
One of them at once ran and grabbed a sponge.
Others said, Wait.
Let's see if Elijah will come and save him.
At once the curtain in the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
The earth shook, and rocks split apart.
The officer and the soldiers guarding Jesus felt the earthquake and saw everything else that happened.
Jesus is buried.
Then Joseph put the body in his own tomb that had been cut into solid rock and had never been used.
The angel said to the women, don't be afraid.
Come, see the place where his body was lying.
Go there, and you will see him.
That is what I came to tell you.
Then Jesus said, don't be afraid.
Tell my followers to go to Galilee.
They will see me there.
The story of the guard
They told the chief priests everything that had happened.
If the governor hears about this, we will talk to him.
You won't have anything to worry about.
Jesus came to them and said:
I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth.
I will be with you always, even until the end of the world.
The message of John the Baptist.
This is the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Straight away God's Spirit made Jesus go into the desert.
He said, the time has come, God's kingdom will soon be here.
Turn back to God and believe the good news.
Jesus said to them, come with me.
I will teach you how to bring in people instead of fish.
At once the two brothers dropped their nets and went with him.
They were in a boat, mending their nets.
A man with an evil spirit.
Jesus and his disciples went to the town of Capernaum.
Everyone was amazed at his teaching.
Have you come to destroy us?
I know who you are, you are God's Holy One.
Jesus threatened the evil spirit.
Be quiet and come out of the man.
The spirit shook him.
Then it gave a loud shout and left.
Everyone was completely surprised and kept saying to each other, what is this?
It must be some new kind of powerful teaching.
Even the evil spirits obey him.
News about Jesus quickly spread all over Galilee.
As soon as Jesus left the meeting place with James and John, they went home with Simon and Andrew.
Jesus went to her.
He took hold of her hand and helped her up.
In fact, the whole town gathered around the door of the house.
Simon and the others started looking for him.
This is why I have come.
Jesus felt sorry for the man.
At once the leprosy disappeared, and he was well.
He said, don't tell anyone about this.
Just go and show the priest that you are well.
He must think he is God.
Only God can forgive sins.
The man got straight up.
Once again, Jesus went to the shore of Lake Galilee.
So he got up and went with Jesus.
Later, Jesus and his disciples were having dinner at Levi's house.
The followers of John the Baptist and the Pharisees often went without eating.
His wife Elizabeth was from the family of Aaron.
Zechariah was confused and afraid when he saw the angel.
But the angel told him:
Don't be afraid, Zechariah because God has heard your prayers.
Your son will be a great servant of the Lord.
And people who now disobey God will begin to think as they ought to.
That is how John will get people ready for the Lord.
My wife and I are both very old.
You have not believed what I have said.
But everything will take place when it is supposed to.
Angel Gabriel tells about the birth of Jesus.
She was engaged to Joseph from the family of King David.
The angel greeted Mary and said, you are truly blessed.
The Lord is with you.
Then the angel told Mary, don't be afraid.
God is with you, and you will have a son.
His name will be Jesus.
He will be great and will be called the Son of God Most High.
Nothing is impossible for God.
Mary said, I am the Lord's servant.
Mary visits Elizabeth.
She went into Zechariah's home, where she greeted Elizabeth.
The Holy Spirit came upon Elizabeth.
Then in a loud voice she said to Mary:
God has blessed you more than any other woman.
He has also blessed the child you will have.
Why should the mother of my Lord come to me?
The Lord has blessed you because you believed that he will keep his promise.
Mary said:
Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, then she went back home.
When Elizabeth's son was born, her neighbours and relatives heard how kind the Lord had been to her, and they too were glad.
But Elizabeth said, no, his name is John.
The people argued, no one in your family has ever been named John.
Zechariah asked for a writing tablet.
Then he wrote, his name is John.
Everyone was amazed.
Straight away Zechariah started speaking and praising God.
All the neighbours were frightened because of what had happened, and everywhere in Zide people kept talking about these things.
Everyone who heard about this wondered what this child would grow up to be.
They knew that the Lord was with him.
Mary was engaged to Joseph and travelled with him to Bethlehem.
She was soon going to have a baby.
and while they were there, she gave birth to her firstborn son.
That night in the fields near Bethlehem some shepherds were guarding their sheep.
The shepherds were frightened.
But the angel said, don't be afraid.
Suddenly many other angels came down from heaven and joined in praising God.
Praise God in heaven.
Peace on earth to everyone who pleases God.
Everyone listened and was surprised.
Simeon was a good man.
Simeon took the baby in his arms and thanked God.
The child will be like a warning sign.

The Market Boat.
It’s fantastic.
The play shop is now a play market.
Playgroup is like a real market.
Jean Paul buys vegetables like his father.
Jean Paul sells vegetables like the vegetable seller:
Tomatoes, tomatoes.
10 rupees a pound madam.
Beetroot, beetroot.
Take one for Rs 5, Sir.
Then he wants to go and paint.
His drawing of the little market looks like a Market Boat.
After lunch Jean Paul goes to sleep on the mattress.
He dreams his Market Boat is floating on the sea.
Tomato says to Carrot: “Where are we going?”
Carrot says in a frightened voice: “I don’t know.”
Beetroot has a big voice.
All the vegetables jump out.
They get smashed up and cut to pieces.
All eggs in the Market Boat get smashed, all except one, that is.
It falls into a ball of seaweed, in the middle of rocks.
The egg gets warm when the sun shines on it.
At night the rocks stay warm until quite late.
One day the egg starts to crack.
A chick pecks its way out on to the seaweed.
The little hen turns round and finds the Scarecrow.
She gets scared.
Her voice trembles.
The vegetables landed up all over the place.
But all grew again.
This is why the vegetables in this garden grow up looking so beautiful.
The little hen goes to look for food outside the garden.
Jean Paul wakes up.
The shop story.
Zan and Mariliz own a shop.
At seven o’clock, they open up the shop.
People come in to get their groceries.
Zan and Mariliz work all day long.
The hands of the clock move round: seven o’clock, eight o’clock, nine o’clock, ten o’clock, eleven o’clock, noon.
They work from 1 o’clock to 7 o’clock.
Then night-time comes.
It’s all dark outside.
Zan and Mariliz close up the shop.
When everything has gone quiet in the shop, mice come out from the corners.
Six little mice live behind a crate of dried beans.
There is one crate with butter beans in it and another one with split peas in it.
Five mice live behind the tin cans.
Tins of sardines, cheese, peas, tuna fish and condensed milk.
Four mice live somewhere behind the bottles.
Bottles of orange squash and wine and plastic bottles of oil.
All the mice are so hungry.
What can they do about it?
They all come down to look for a little something to eat.
What is there to eat?
When they’ve finished eating, the mice take over the shop for playing in.
The smallest mouse likes to play chase.
He runs and runs all over the place.
All the other mice run after him.
The empty tin can falls down.
It rolls along the floor, clong, clong, clong.
Suddenly Mariliz wakes up.
She says, “Zan did you hear that?”.
They get up and go to see what’s happening.
When they open the door, it creaks.... errrck.
The mice all run and hide behind the rolls of toilet paper.
Quiet as mice.
Zan and Mariliz don’t see anything.
Then they go back to bed.
When everything is quiet again, the mice very quietly come out again.
This time two mice climb on a broom that’s hanging up in the air.
They swing on it.
One mouse sits on the left side and the other one on the right side.
Then they swing back and forth.
Just like in the playground.
It swings to and fro.
Bottles fall over and get broken smash.
Zan, wakes up and says, “Mariliz, did you hear that?”.
They get up and go and have a look.
They push the door open and it creaks errrrck.
All the mice run away and hide.
Quiet as a mouse.
Zan and Mariliz can’t see anything.
All they see is broken bottles all over the floor.
There’s orange juice everywhere.
“Oh, dear! What a mess! “ they say.
They get very worried.
They are very tired as it is.
When Zan and Mariliz go back to bed again, the mice all come out to play.
They start to play on the weigh scale.
The needle on the scale moves up and up and then stops on 2 lbs.
Then, it’s the turn of a mouse.
The mouse climbs on to the scale.
The needle on the scale moves up and up and then stops on 1 lb.
The little mouse climbs on to the scale.
The needle on the scale moves up and up and then stops on 1 /2 lb.
Zan opens the shop at seven o’clock.
Somebody comes to buy a 1/4 lb of tea.
Somebody else buys a litre of water.
Zan takes the coins and the notes and puts them in the till.
He hands people back their change.
Mariliz comes back with a beautiful cat.
When all is quiet in the shop, the cat miaows.
All the mice prick up their ears and listen.. “Miaow, miaow...”.
The little mouse wriggles and squirms.
He escapes and goes and hides behind the tubes of toothpaste in boxes.
For a long time the little mouse shivers with fear.
All the other mice shiver with fear as well.
They’re very, very frightened.
They hide behind the counter, terrified.
And until now, there are no little mice nor any great big rats living in Zan and Mariliz’ shop anymore.
Search for the Sun.
Where they live, it rains almost every day.
They decided to go and search for the sun.
Quietly, they sneaked out of the house.
Marde, the gardener, had chopped off a huge bunch of bananas.
Kankre and Lezlez climbed on the tree.
Rara was smart.
He quickly went, and cut a wick of bamboo.
“What are you going to do with the stick, Rara?”.
Do you know what Rara did with the stick?
Rara jumped onto the banana tree.
The banana tree had become a raft!
The bamboo stick was a rudder!
The banana tree began to move.
It started to float down the hill.
The raft floated on the water.
The banana tree shot out into a big river.
Rara had to use his rudder to change direction.
The raft kept on going down the hill until they could see the sea.
Kankre, Lezlez and Rara had been right.
Down by the seaside the sun was shining.
It was shining brightly and there was no rain.
It felt good to have the warmth of the sun on their skin.
Marde’s garden.
Marde wears a hat.
He has a moustache.
He comes to work on a bicycle.
Sometimes he speaks English and says: “How are you?”.
The children laugh.
They don’t realise Marde is speaking another language.
Marde’s garden is very beautiful.
Marde tells the children why fencing needs to be put up around the garden.
Marde says he spends all day working the soil.
He sits down to take out stones and to pull out weeds.
Then he prepares beds.
Marde works very hard all day until he goes home in the evening.
All day long, all the dogs in town are tied up.
People only let their dog go free at night.
When it’s dark dogs walk about looking for their friends.
One night there’s a dog that has been untied.
He stands all alone in the night.
He is scared he might get hit by someone.
Far away a dog answers back woof, woof, woof.
Now he knows where his friend is.
He runs and runs until he gets to a corner.
The soil feels soft, very soft under his paws.
Lovely, he says.
The dog calls his friend.
The dogs have a very good time.
But they destroy all the seed beds.
They roll about on the soil and make one big mess.
When Marde comes the next day, he gets a terrible shock.
What a mess! Poor Marde knows he has to start all over again.
He sits down and thinks.
Marde remembers a friend of his.
This is why Marde can plant his garden so beautifully.
Pekoy goes fishing.
Every day Pekoy sees fishermen go out fishing in a boat.
He wants to go out fishing like a fisherman.
But, he hasn’t got a boat.
What can he think of to use as a boat?
What if he cuts a paw paw in half?
He could use one half as a boat.
Pekoy flies over to the pawpaw tree.
Then he goes off to look for his friend.
With his saw Krekre cuts the pawpaw in two.
Now Pekoy also needs a fishing rod just like the fishermen have got.
That will make a nice fishing rod.
Pekoy takes his fishing rod and climbs into his pawpaw boat.
The boat floats off at great speed.
He wants to stop and fish but he can’t stop.
How will he be able to fish when the boat keeps pushing along?
Then the boat comes in to land.
Pekoy gets out of the boat and sets off to look for another friend.
Zoko lives in the woods.
She is very clever.
Zoko comes with Pekoy to the edge of the sea.
Zoko goes and gets some rope.
She ties one end to a heavy rock.
Zoko ties the other end of the rope to the boat.
Once again Pekoy takes his fishing rod along.
He puts the rock in the boat.
Then he goes out to sea again.
Poor Pekoy.
They’ve gone somewhere else.
Pekoy goes back to see Zoko to ask her advice.
She has seen fishermen use the wood from jackfruit trees to make oars.
When the oars are ready, pekoy gets into the pawpaw boat to go out fishing again.
He rows and rows.
Then he throws the rock over into the sea... plump.
The boat rocks a little.
Then it stops rocking.
It stays still.
Pekoy then casts his fishing line as far as he can.
He waits a little while.
Suddenly, he feels the line tighten.
He tugs quickly on his fishing rod.
But the string comes out with no fish on it.
Without any bread left either.
Pekoy goes back to see Zoko.
Zoko takes Pekoy to see Ares.
Ares is the best fisherman in the area.
He shows them how to tie a hook at the end of the string.
Then, he shows them how to look for bait.
They can use hermit crabs he says.
They can dig for worms in the sea.
a needle fish, a rock cod, a green parrot fish, a jack, a red mullet, a tailspot wrasse, a picasso fish, an eel, a rabbit fish.
Pekoy is very happy.
He invites all the friends who’ve helped him. Zoko, Krekre and Ares.
Then they have a party at the seaside.
Pekoy and Ares eat the fish.
Zoko eats bananas.
Krekre eats the tiny creatures in the sea weed.
Afterwards they dance around the fire.
Beautiful Old Woman of the Sea.
They want to buy presents for their families.
But sometimes at Christmas time no money is left to buy presents.
Malini is a little girl who lives by the sea.
She does not live in one of the big smart bungalows.
These families come to live in their bungalows only on weekends or on school holidays.
Malini lives by the sea all the year round.
She lives in a fisherman’s corrugated iron house.
Last year, Malini got a small guitar from Father Christmas.
“I don’t know.” answers mother.
“Perhaps Father Christmas is dead.”
“Has Father Christmas come early?”.
“No”, says her mother.
Malini listens as the children of the bungalow play games.
Malini’s Aunt Sakunn comes to visit on the day before Christmas.
Aunt Sakunn gives Malini a small parcel.
Malini opens it.
Out comes a pair of underpants and shirt.
“Thank you, Auntie,” says Malini.
They look sad, too.
“Let’s go for a walk, “ says Aunt Sakunn.
“Let’s sing a song. “ says Aunt Sakunn.
But the children do not feel like singing.
Suddenly, fire crackers explode in the garden of one of the bungalows.
The sound travels across the lagoon.
It hits the reef.
The breakers calm down.
All the foam disappears.
Look! There’s a channel.
And look! There’s a boat coming through.
It glides smoothly into the lagoon.
In the boat sits an old woman.
She is old and also very beautiful.
She has smiley wrinkles.
The children begin to sing.
Aunt Sakunn joins hands with Malini and the other children.
They dance around the casuarina tree.
The children look up at the branches of the tree.
Are those fallen stars shining on the branches?
Look at the seaweed like frills on the leaves.
Malini reaches for the shell with her name.
Inside is a balloon.
Malini blows it and it becomes big.
She looks for the Beautiful old Woman of the Sea, but she is nowhere to be seen.
Each of the children has a tiny present in a shell.
They run home quickly to show their parents.
What happens?
Around her house are bright lights.
Everyone is singing or laughing.
Aunt Sakunn beats the dolok.
Malini’s mother plays the ravann.
Her brothers each play a triangle.
Malini and her friends dance and dance around the fire.
“It is the Beautiful Old Woman of the Sea’; says Malini.
“She came here after she left the boat.”
Her brothers find their toys.
Just before dawn, Malini falls asleep.
She dreams of the Beautiful Old Woman of the Sea.
Abu in the woods.
Abu’s father is a gamekeeper.
When it is hunting season, people are allowed to kill deer with guns.
There isn’t a school where Abu’s father lives.
That’s why Abu lives with his mother in town.
Abu pulls the branches to one side.
There is a big clearing.
In the clearing there are lots of rocks.
Some are small, some are medium and some are big.
Abu stands for a while looking at them.
What’s happening?
He can’t believe it.
Is a rock moving?
Suddenly, what looks like a head lifts itself up.
It has two big horns.
Then, two front legs get up, then two legs at the back.
Rocks don’t have heads, horns or legs.
Abu is wondering what on earth this could be.
Then he sees a medium sized rock moving.
Another head lifts itself up.
This one doesn’t have horns.
Just ears.
The smaller rocks also begin to move.
Some have little horns.
Some just have ears.
They all have front and back legs.
The sun is bright.
When lots of rocks have got up, they start to dance in the clearing.
Abu stares at them.
He’s very happy.
Abu counts his steps back.
He knocks at the door - knock, knock, knock.
I thought you had gone into the woods.
It’s dangerous to go into the woods during the hunting season.
People shoot at deer and wild pigs with guns.
His mother laughs and says, “that’s a father deer Abu, a stag”.
“There were little rocks, some just had ears,
others had horns” says Abu.
“Those are baby deer Abu, fawns” says Abu’s mother.
Abu asks his mother.
“This is called an echo Abu”.
Abu’s mother says, “enough questions for today, let’s eat now”.
In a garden a baby insect is born.
He is called Sinn Sinn.
He is naked.
He finds lots of little holes in all the leaves.
The old man with a moustache is very angry.
Sinn Sinn hears what the old man with the moustache says, loud and clear.
Sinn Sinn climbs right up to the top of the banana tree.
He wraps himself in cotton wool.
Sinn Sinn lives inside this parcel.
The old man with a moustache makes the rain fall.
But he only makes the rain fall below the trees.
The rain does not fall on Sinn Sinn at all.
He’s hiding away in the parcel.
For days and days Sinn Sinn stays inside the parcel.
He gets very tired.
He begins to cry, gently.
Sinn Sinn feels very strong.
He starts to wriggle about.
The parcel bursts open.
But he’s got two big wings.
Sinn Sinn flaps his wings and he flies away.
Now Sinn Sinn is not in the cocoon.
He flies off to meet his friends.
Look at the cover.
What do you see?
Huge monsters.
Do you know what the monsters are called?
Adina has drawn a dinosaur.
It is as tall as a huge tree.
To find out what is on the other side.
Mariam says: “The dinosaur does not have babies in its tummy”.
It lays eggs.
Then afterwards, small dinosaurs come out of the eggs.
There were dinosaurs on the earth a long long time ago.
Now there are no dinosaurs left.
They are extinct like the dodo.
Adina asks: “they are extinct, What does extinct mean?”.
Mariam answers: “There are no dinosaurs, no dodos”.
When people dug the earth their bones were found.
Adina says: “Dinododo?”
Adina says: “Look, look at what we’ve found”.
We dug the earth.
We found a bone.
“Is it a dinosaur’s or a dodo’s?”, Mariam answers:
No Adina.
This is the bone of a deer.
Kolos dug the earth and hid it there.
Small creatures go on a Journey.
When will the four of us go to Mauritius, then?
Oh dear, I won’t be able to go with you.
I’ve got far too much housework to do.
The children don’t give me a moment’s rest.
Oh dear, I can’t go with you.
You go.
Can’t you see how busy I am?
Little Shrimp puts his hand up to speak.
I’m too small, look at me.
I’m only 3years old.
I haven’t even started at playgroup yet.
Perhaps I’ll go to Mauritius when I go to the big school.
In fact, Little Shrimp was frightened.
He did not know how to swim very well.
And the sea is very, very big.
He says : “You can all go, go on Long Eel, you go”.
“That depends”, said Long Eel.
That depends.
I’ll think about it.
Look at the time.
When will the four of us go to Mauritius?
It doesn’t matter.
Nobody has to invite me.
I know that you don’t want me to go with you.
I know you don’t.
His cheeks were puffed up.
Forget it.
You don’t have to invite me.
Nobody likes me.
Then they all started to speak at once.
Don’t say things like that, Squid.
You, Little Shrimp, you’re quite big enough.
When are you going to decide, Long Eel?
Ask your husband to take a turn at looking after children.
Then they all made one big noise.
Blah, blah, blah.
Mrs Octopus closed her ears by putting four legs in each one.
Right away, Mrs Octopus went into her cave and asked Mr Octopus outright: “As well as the other house-work you do, keeping the
No need to worry.
I’ll look after them.
Dear Mrs Tortoise, I hope you are well.
My three friends and I  might be coming to Mauritius.
Best Wishes, Mrs Octopus.
Is it true that I’m too little to go to Mauritius?
That means you’re growing up now.
Then, they invited Mr. Squid in person and in writing.
How could Squid refuse?
He accepted.
I’m sure they didn’t really.
Just to please me.
But I’ll go anyway.
“You gossip too much”, he said.
There’s work for us to be done.
Enough messing about friends.
Let’s go to Mauritius.
“Is it an island?”, asked Little Shrimp.
Of course it’s an island, just like Rodrigues.
Long Eel straightened his glasses with his tail.
Then he took out an atlas.
Look, that’s Mauritius.
All of it.
Lots of islands.
They include our island Rodrigues.
There’s also the island of Mauritius.
There’s Tromelin.
There’s Agalega.
There’s St Brandon.
Yes, there’s even an archipelago.
The Chagos Archipelago.
That’s where Diego Garcia and Peros Banhas are.
And Salomon as well.
There’s also another archipelago, Cargados
Look, here’s Rodrigues.
Here’s Mauritius.
Let’s go.
Mauritius, here we come.
They sailed across the sea.
Flying fish flew by.
The Tropic Birds hovered above to look at them.
Dolphins played around in the waves in front of the Mauritius Pride.
Night fell.
They slept on the deck.
In the morning Long Eel looked at his watch and said :
It’s seven o’clock, friends.
Look, there’s  Port Louis harbour right in front of us.
We’re there.
Look, there’s Mrs Tortoise, there’s Mrs Tortoise.
Mrs Octopus said excitedly.
Mrs Tortoise has come to meet us.
Hello Mrs Tortoise, let me introduce my friends.
Long Eel, Little Shrimp, and?
Mr. Squid puffed out his cheeks, “ It isn’t fair”.
“Let’s go”, said Mrs Tortoise.
We’re going to Flic en Flac.
We’re going by Special Route.
Special Route?
What’s that?
Little Shrimp asked loudly.
I’ve been on a bus before.
“I’ve travelled in a car before”, said Mrs Octopus.
But, what is this Special Route?
“I only know what a jeep is”, said Long Eel.
The last to speak is Mr Squid.
He says, “I’ve seen on Air Mauritius plane at plaine Corail”.
They all stopped talking.
They scratched their heads and thought.
What could a Special Route be?
Maybe it’s a carplane.
Perhaps it’s a bur lorry.
It could be a helicopter.
May be it’s a satellite.
Or a bicycle.
“Here we are, climb on”, said Mrs Tortoise.
It was a bus.
They got into the bus.
When they got to the first bus stop the bus didn’t stop.
It carried on.
“Oh, dear!”, shouted Mr Squid.
Don’t leave them at the bus stop like that.
Bus Conductor, where are your manners?
You must not drive on like that when you see people at the bus stop.
“This is a special Route”, the Conductor told Mr Squid.
At the second bus stop the same thing happens.
At the third the bus just drives on.
Yes my Granny talked about Special Transport as well.
They talked a little.
Then they went for a swim.
When they finished they ate and had a rest.
Then there was dancing.
Flame-tree Lane.
Flame-trees covered in flowers.
Lychee trees full of fruit.
Blue light in a joyous sky.
Giving birth to a new year.
New Year, New Year!
Come children, let's hold hands.
Let's make a circle and dance.
Let's wipe away the past.
Together we drink to our health.
Today life starts again.
He does not think we should operate, waste of time.
He prescribed drug for the pain.
When the departure date arrives, no need to cry.
but if there is time you can complete what needs to be done.
I had always wanted to tell the story of my village.
the way I see it.
the way I lived it.
Now I have no excuse.
My children have given me a laptop.
This means I can write.
read the news on the internet, watch movies,listen to music.
play card games like FreeCell and Solitaire without leaving my room.
not even my bed sometimes.
The laptop is a great invention.
I don’t want to give anyone any trouble.
My Village.
Chapter 1.
In the village where I was born.
there were several lanes that stopped dead.
at the edge of a gorge called Grande Ravine.
except for one there was a range of hills of different elevations.
On the side with no hill was the sea.
Not many people lived on Flame Tree Lane.
Flower bushes were rare.
We used to call them “Mazanbik”.
They raised pigs, and grew manioc and sweet potatoes.
Why don’t you just stay there?
The main road in our village was called Main Street.
Our village was cut off.
Little changes were okay, but big changes never!
Geography dictated our movements.
Bit by bit life went on.
In our village you would often hear “chalata dire-dire!”.
Everyone appeared satisfied with that.
Geography was helped by Tradition.
Only boys were allowed to go to school.
As I was saying, I was born on the first of January.
More importantly, I was a boy.
Still, my parents, grandparents and uncle were super excited.
It's hard to know what goes on in the minds of elders.
The place I lived was called Camp Ramsamy.
There were three generations of people in Camp Ramsamy.
They also grew ganja for their own consumption.
It was strange stuff.
That made up the teacher’s salary.
That's why many children could not go to school.
My mum refused to see this.
His name was Kavi Ram.
In our house, we called him Kavi Uncle.
Girls and boys learned together.
My little book of names became a veritable dictionary.
Initially, there wasn’t much interest and business was slow.
It was a big success!
Our village was besieged by an invisible enemy.
He was never heard from again.
Chapter 2.
I passed my 12 years exams.
Now I had to decide what I would do.
I wanted to go to secondary school.
my mum was agreeable.
my dad, as usual, preferred to wait for my grandfather to pronounce.
There was much commotion.
My first two years at school went pretty well.
When I began my third year, there was something that made me feel weird.
Although girls and boys formed separate groups, there were boys who were attracted to girls and girls attracted to boys.
I wasn't attracted to girls at all.
There was a boy in my class who often came into my dreams.
He was handsome and sweet.
Instead of playing soccer or volleyball, we both preferred to sit together under a tree.
One day when no-one was looking, I kissed him on the mouth.
He didn’t say anything.
he just stared, with tears in his eyes.
It was with Sunil from Camp Bombay that I discovered sexuality.
Like all lovers, we swore that our love would last forever.
The more I think about it, the more strange it seems that no-one had any suspicions about our relationship.
I think that in people’s minds we were just two good friends.
My grandfather decided to open a shop.
He had a Chinese friend with a shop on the Main Street.
That's where he would buy his litres of rum.
According to the law, you couldn’t sell rum by the litre but Captain —that’s what everyone called him —made an exception for my grandfather.
For quite some time, he had been encouraging my gradfather to open a retail shop.
Captain believed my grandfather had a nose for business.
He even gave him a Chinese name:  Ah Pow.
No-one really quite why but all his friends called him Ah Pow.
He even showed him how to use Chinese numbers so customers wouldn’t discover the secret to his business.
My grandfather, who had made me swear not to abandon our ways, didn’t hesitate to write in Chinese in order to protect his interests.
When I turned sixteen, my grandfather decided I had studied enough.
Business was growing and new blood was needed in the shop.
From the first of January that year, I became an apprentice to my father and uncle.
Siram Uncle, my father’s youngest brother, was about twenty-five.
He was quite smart and taught himself to read and write.
He spent a lot of money on books and used to share his knowledge with me.
His wife, who was a few years older than me, had gone to school and was very smart.
She supported her husband.
He had a suspicion about me and Sunil but he played dumb.
After two years, I was promoted at work.
Grandpa, Dad and Uncle decided that I could sleep in the shop since I was the only one who wasn’t married!
Working in the shop wasn’t very interesting but it made it easy for me to read books and newspapers, and at night I could sleep with my sweetheart.
The only problem was that I had to get up early, before first light, to open the back door and let Sunil out.
My life was relatively problem-free until my mother said she needed to talk to me one Sunday afternoon before going to the shop to sleep.
“Bala, I've found a good girl for you.”
“A girl for me?”
“You prefer a boy?”
“Don’t be an idiot!  I’m serious.”
“Me too!”
“You’re the opposite of your father, he has women everywhere and kids in every corner… You…”
Dad cleaned up.
He took them all for himself.
That’s why I'm left in the cold.
Look, boy, you’re nearly twenty.
Mummy won’t always be here to look after you.
It’s time for you to get married, have children.
Why have children?
The world’s already overpopulated.
You sound like your Uncle Siram.
He’s right.
She’s a good girl, I tell you, light-skinned, been to school.
Her mother tells me she can sew, she can cook.
Can she make love?
You’re gonna get it from me!
When my mother latched on to something, there was no letting go.
In her own way, she knew how to press her case.
She wasn’t done with me yet.
She was second to none when it came to arranging marriages.
My dad, who was an asshole who used to screw around, was a pawn in my mother’s hands, putty that she knew how to shape and roll any way she wanted.
The next move was to win over my grandmother who would then handle my grandfather.
Next thing I knew there was a family meeting, before I could even express my own opinion.
Neither the young girl nor I was implicated in this transaction were present.
I began to pity her.
But my own situation was much more serious.
If I opposed the family decision, I would have to leave my job in the shop, which was the only work I knew how to do, I’d become an outcast.
I would have to leave my village, find another base.
That didn’t worry me too much.
Far more difficult, I would have to tell my family I was gay and that I already had a partner with whom I was extremely happy.
I went to see Siram Uncle for some advice.
No, Uncle, I'm not impotent.
I just don't enjoy it with women.
I  prefer Sunil.
If that's how it is, then do both.
Marry a girl to make the family happy, and live your life to make yourself happy.
But how to tell my Sunil?
He was as delicate as a rosebud in the cool morning dew.
I met up with him at the beach and there, underneath a casuarina tree, I finally told him the dilemma I was in.
He kept very quiet, as if he had always known this time would come.
He knew that in our village we didn’t like change.
But what took him by surprise was that I was going to play along.
In our village, we always played along in order to avoid any conflicts.
Everyone tried to be on good terms with everyone else.
Sunil always said he found that way of acting revolting.
He let me talk without saying anything.
Then, he got up slowly, got on his bike, and without saying a word took the shortcut to Camp Bombay.
My mother was very happy when I told her that I agreed to her plan.
Her health wasn’t too good, so she was especially relieved that she would be getting a free housemaid.
After the wedding with ennalou, bride and groom went to the designated bedroom.
If time could have jumped ahead twenty-four hours, I sure would have been grateful.
There was no shortcut for me — I had to face the music.
I hadn’t thought through the consequences of my decision at all.
Now there was a girl in my bed and both our families were outside expecting results.
What to do?
Tell her the truth?
What if she started screaming hysterically?
Pretend I’m heterosexual?
Would I be able to penetrate her?
I started to caress her back, moved further down, she let me.
I took off her panties, turned her around, and took her from behind.
She cried out.
I was inside her.
The parents would be pleased.
There was blood.
When we got to know each other a bit better, I told her my story.
Expressionless, she promised she would keep my secret.
Later I discovered that Ratna was more worried than I was because when she was twelve her uncle had raped her and then killed himself.
Ever since then, she associated vaginal sex with pain, shame and death.
What we had done had allowed us both to save face.
This way, life could go on as if everything was normal.
One week after the wedding, my grandfather summoned my father, Siram Uncle and me to discuss how we were going to keep watch in the store at night.
Until I got married, I was the one who slept there at night.
In his patriarchal way, my grandfather had said that a married man couldn’t leave his wife every night to guard the shop.
I was dreaming of me and Sunil.
I think I was smiling.
“Bala!  Why are you grinning like a fool?”
“Who, me?”
“Yes, you?”
“Sorry, Grandpa.”
My father suggested adding two rooms to the building so that a couple could live there.
Too costly, my grandfather said.
My grandfather then suggested that Tonton Siram and I take turns, every other night.
We made long faces.
Siram Uncle had a woman, a young widow, who lived near the store, and I was in a similar situation.
“Grandpa, I don't know if what I'm thinking is right, but what do you say to us doing it every other week?”
“I think that's a good idea, Dad”.
“Well, if the two of you are agreeable, then it's done”.
Sunil made it very clear that he was not a plaything, just there to satisfy my selfish whims.
I had made a clean break of it, and it was broken.
It couldn’t be repaired.
He had already started to make a new life for himself, away from ‘Camp Hypocrite’.
Sunil played guitar and liked to write songs.
When he had gotten on his bike and left me that day on the beach, he had been really upset.
He felt I had betrayed a true love.
That same night he went to a bar where a band played now and then, guys he knew.
That night, the leader walked up to him and asked if he could sub for a band member who was sick.
“Without rehearsing?” Sunil asked.
The band leader told him he could just improvise.
It was a good beginning and the band asked him to join them.
He agreed and pretty soon they had a fan base of youngsters and they also became quite successful playing at parties, weddings, concerts and fairs.
Our break-up freed Sunil from the fetters that were keeping him from blossoming.
But nothing is cut and dried—life is full of ups and downs.
His group took the name ‘Cactus Flower’ and they began to play in beach hotels, and overseas too.
Sunil wrote and sang songs that went to the top of the charts.
He became a star.
But an artist’s life is not easy, and the life of a gay artist is even harder.
He became a user, often sharing needles.
That’s how he became HIV-positive, even though he and his boyfriends used condoms.
One day I got a message that Sunil had been hospitalized and wanted to see me.
I rushed to him.
My first love had become a skeleton, skin and bones, and could only whisper two or three words.
“Forgive me, Bal!”
“No, honey, I'm the one who messed up.”
“I love you!”
“I love you, too.”
Chapter 3.
There was a textile factory in the village.
It was the policy of the central government to promote industrial development in rural areas.
Businessmen liked to hire women because otherwise they’d have to pay men’s wages, which were one and a half times more than women’s.
The technology was primitive so even uneducated women could be hired.
Lots of women my age began to work in the factory.
One day, Solange, who lived in Camp Mimi — it was weird how much she resembled Bala — told me that her boss was looking for workers.
My mother-in-law was never going to let me work.
My only hope was Bala.
The fact that we had both had life experiences made us good friends, bonded us together and made us determined to give our lives meaning.
I needed him as much as he needed me.
We had agreed to put up a show for the benefit of others, but we had an understanding.
I wanted to break out of the prison of convention and I knew that Bala would help me.
And he did help me.
He threatened his mother that he would takes his wife and live in a house far away if she wasn’t allowed to work in the factory.
His mother had to give in.
For the first time in my life, I was financially independent.
The work conditions were difficult but at least I got a rare taste of freedom unknown in my domestic servitude to my in-laws.
Because of his work in the shop, Bala and I spent very little time together.
I tried to console him when Sunil died.
He felt guilty.
I decided to help him at this difficult time, before asking him for a divorce.
One night he told me he had a boyfriend.
“Do you love him?”
“I don't know, but when I’m with him, I forget my sorrow.”
“Is it serious?”
“Dont know,  May be”.
“Can I leave?”
“You want to leave?”
I only had to move my head a little.
He got the message.
I got to know Bhai Farouk, the van driver who drove us when we worked the night shift.
My friends at work told me that he and his wife lived alone in a big house.
They had only one child who had died of an overdose.
Once in a while they would take boarders.
One early morning, when he dropped me off, I asked him about it.
“You’re in luck, Miss!  My boarder has just left.”
He called all women “Miss”.
She was right.
It was a good way to avoid crap.
Some women don't like it if you call them "Mrs”.
Bala helped me a lot when I moved.
He was firm with his mother, telling her not to stick her nose in my business.
I had a comfortable room to myself in Bhai Farouk’s house.
Everything else was shared.
His wife, who right away asked me to call her Auntie, was well educated.
Later I learned that, because she hadn’t gotten any proposals, her parents pressured her to marry when Bhai Farouk sent one.
For Khadija Auntie’s family, it was a source of great shame if a girl was left high and dry.
There were all kinds of gossip.
And yet, Khadija, who had grown up in the capital, went to high school, passed her exams, and was admitted to university overseas, which was rare in those days.
But when she started her second year, her father had a stroke and his business suffered.
Khadija had to return immediately.
She hadn’t been able to become a professional, and independent.
There was only one solution, get her married.
Given her situation, finding a man was tough:  lawyers and doctors didn't think she was rich enough, civil servants were worried about an educated woman who had tasted life at university.
Khadija was left high and dry.
For her brother, who had taken over her father’s business, she was nothing but a huge burden.
A distant relative of Khadija’s who was also related to Bhai Farouk arranged their marriage.
Khadija was five years older than Bhai Farouk, a simple peddler.
Once they were married, Khadija helped Farouk with his business.
Instead of letting him put the goods on a bicyle and selling it throughout our village, his wife gave him a motorbike.
She also kept accounts of his sales.
Later on, they had a storehouse built where they could stock a lot of the merchandise that Khadija and Farouk would buy once a month in the capital.
When Khadija was expecting, the doctor was a bit concerned because Khadija of her age.
The baby was delivered by C-section and the gynecologist told the couple to “close the tap”.
Khadija and Farouk spoiled their son rotten.
Because their business was growing, they didn't have time for him, a maid used to take care of him.
The boy got whatever he asked for.
Early on, he started drinking.
A little later, he started doing drugs.
He’d steal money from his mother’s drawer or from his father’s pocket, so that he could buy his dose.
One day a dealer proposed a deal.
He took delivery, sold some of the goods, used some himself and when the time came to pay up, there was a large deficit.
He panicked.
The drug lords realized that this kid had become dangerous because of what he knew.
He died of an overdose.
Today, Khadija is about sixty-five and Farouk sixty.
Farouk got a contract to transport factory workers.
He bought a van and a bus.
They had material comforts but they were always burdened by great sadness.
They felt that they were responsible for the death of their child, but they didn’t fully understand how.
That not knowing was the greater torture.
Now, with me around, a boarder who before long was like a child in their home, Khadija and Farouk began to live again.
One day Khadija asked me to consider continuing my studies.
I had passed my 12 years exams with distinction, I could study upto Matriculation.
“I'm twenty years old, isn't it too late?”
It's never too late.
Look, I know what I'm suggesting is scary, so let’s meet half way.
Get your secondary school diploma, then we’ll see.
Is there a lot to learn?
I don't know the curriculum, but I do know someone who can help us.
I can help you in all subjects, I think.
It would make me very happy.
I don't want to trouble you, Auntie.
This isn't trouble, dear, no trouble at all.
You’re going to help me forget my troubles.
For four years, I went to work and I also studied, and when I was close to my twenty-fifth birthday, I passed my exams.
With my diploma, I was able to train to become a primary school teacher.
To do this, I would have to leave my village and learn to live without Khadija Auntie and Farouk Uncle.
It was a difficult decision, but I applied and I was accepted.
I went to see Bala at his shop.
His view was that I’d be making a big mistake if I didn’t go.
Farouk Uncle understood, but Khadija Auntie was very sad.
She was sure we’d never see each other again.
One month after I left, Farouk Uncle phoned me and gave me the sad news.
Chapter 4.
I saw Ratna at Mrs Farouk’s funeral.
She had become a different person, someone who knew who she was and where she wanted to go.
My Dad, who wasn’t too well, gave me his share in the shop.
He and Mum had become quite religious and spent all of their time in prayer.
Siram Uncle and I, like two partners — Grandpa had long since passed on, and decided to change the look of the shop and turn in into a supermarket.
Some of the customers weren't too pleased, especially the ones who were accustomed to buy on credit and pay when they got their wages from the harvest.
Unfortunately for them, this was the road progress had taken.
In our village and in the neighboring areas too, the winds of change had started to blow.
But the change was always in just one direction: every man for himself.
Our area always had the reputation of being temperate.
Not too cold, not too hot, not too humid, not too dry.
It was as if Nature had chosen us for an experiment to find a balance between extremes.
But people worked against it.
For some time, many outsiders had been coming to buy land on which to build second homes.
Slowly all the open spaces were beginning to disappear.
Soon, we heard that Grand Bois and Bois Noir, which had since time immemorial belonged to everyone, were now the property of a developer.
It was the same with Carreau Filaos, Carreau Eucalyptus, Carreau Bois d’Oiseau, Carreau Tekoma.
We used to go wherever we pleased.
Now everywhere we went there were signs: No Entry, Passage Interdit, Private Property.
Same tune everywhere, from the valley all the way to the sea.
Poor farmers were forced to sell their land; rich farmers saw their empires grow.
I remember when Kavi Ram wanted to form a Village Committee to manage our locale.
The poor devil had to leave, and in a hurry.
But ten years ago, the financiers, the big farmers, the industrialists and the professionals succeeded in forming a municipal administration which made it easy for a small group to expand, people who controlled everything: land, water, the plantations, industry, banks, the media.
Instead of trying to win over the heads of the Camps and the clans, they simply bought them off one by one.
Those who tried to resist would discover that the banks had canceled their mortgage, that their children had been expelled for disorderly conduct, or that the canal that brought water to their crops had been blocked up.
Money, my friend, that’s the best argument, the most powerful one.
I myself didn’t have much to complain about because our business was doing well.
We too were “developing”.
In order for us to get ahead, we put the other shops out of business.
It was impossible to compete with us.
We had the support of a group of backers, so we were able to lower prices until our competitors buckled.
I would offer them work in our supermarket, some menial job or other.
Flame-Tree Lane didn’t miss out on development either.
There was a developer who was interested in all the properties along Grande Ravine.
The small landowners, one by one, agreed to give up their land.
When it was our turn, Tonton Siram and I decided to refuse.
The people of Camp Mimi, Bhai Goolam and his wife, Tonton Siram and Tantine Sita, my mother, my father and I, we all got together to discuss the situation.
We were all firm in our resolve no to give up one inch of our land.
But the clay pot gave way to the iron pot.
The agents of the bigwig financiers, like slowly gnawing rats, had eaten away all resistance bit by bit.
At first, the inhabitants of Camp Mimi weren’t sure, but then they were taken in by money’s power of reasoning.
There’s been promises of work, government housing, a consolidated farm for the raising of pigs, a four-lane bridge that was going to cross Grand Ravine; a cable-car that would come up and go down again.
In a flash, there were signatures, exes, thumbprints.
When my mother heard of this ‘betrayal’, she became hysterical, forgot all about her prayers and fell on my father.
That's when I finally understood why Solange looked so much like me.
“Maybe Ratna too!”
Sure, can’t you see, she’s as stubborn as you are.
Banks and suppliers that had extended us generous credit all of a sudden tightened the leash in order to strangle us.
I sold my dignity to save our supermarket.
Modernisation, liberalisation, deregulation, all blew their horns and beat their drums loudly.
Our valley, hillside, everything up to the sea, became a model of development.
The newspapers were full of articles describing the municipality’s success.
No-one was in the least bit interested in finding out what had happened to the farmers, the fishermen, the artisans.
There were no articles about the huge ghetto, a rubbish dump of a city without water, electricity, decent housing, or social services — a human dustbin where alcohol, drugs and AIDS underwent great ‘development’.
People there used to call this hell-hole ‘Danfour’.
I think they were thinking Darfur.
According to official pronouncements, my village, which was organised into Camps and clans, had become a Uni-City, extending from Mapou to Belmont, and from Mademoiselle Jeanne to Grande Ravine.
All differences disappeared.
Prosperity was visible everywhere you looked — a model for everyone.
Gone were clan, class and Camp.
The Uni-City demanded, and got, autonomy.
It became a state within a state.
The industrial area was cosmopolitan, the residential area was cosmopolitan, the commercial area was cosmopolitan.
The Uni-City became a little UN.
From the hillside all the way to the sea, new had completely replaced old.
So much so, that if you walked in Uni-City, you’d think you were in Hong Kong or Singapore, or New York, or London, or Paris.
Completely cosmopolitan!  Artists, poets and painters alike, began to miss ‘the old days.’
But the Autonomous Administration would rapidly denounce all their backward-looking impulses.
The press boycotted them; galleries snubbed them.
Many preferred to emigrate, and local culture went underground.
Holly-Bollywood was wildly successful and spoiling everything else.
Like I said, all the two-bit shops had disappeared and a whole bunch of small supermarkets like ours had taken their place.
They had nice-sounding names:  Flame-Tree, Citronella, Ayapana, Pipik, Cardinal, Plateau, Belmont, and the like.
The service was friendly because they knew everyone in their area.
Too good to last.
The investors, who were on the lookout for areas that would guarantee them maximum profit in a hurry, homed in on retail.
A multinational called Universal Stores decided to buy the whole lot and proceeded to modernise and reorganise the retail trade.
Both Siram Uncle and I knew that we were caught in a vice.
They were just too strong.
No matter what we did, we would still be screwed.
They suggested that the two of us work with them as Assitant Managers.
Siram Uncle, who had been having serious marriage problems for some time, couldn't take the pressure of this new situation and took to the bottle.
One day he gave me his whole library because, he said, there was no future in books.
Only then did I realize how deeply knowledgeable he was.
He didn't have any kids—in his mind I was his spiritual child.
I was also close to Sita Auntie.
We had become good friends and I was the one on whose shoulder she cried.
In the beginning, she tried everything she could to save Siram Uncle from the snare of alcohol.
But one day, exhausted and sickened, she left him.
His lifeline gone, Siram Uncle sank deeper still.
Shame, loneliness and depression helped Thanatos prevail over Eros.
He was nearly fifty years old the day he died.
Chapter 5.
I lost my mother and father when I was very young and my aunt adopted me.
I was raised by the Treepats, a family who lived at the water’s edge.
Kausalya Auntie treated me like her own child.
She encouraged me with my schoolwork.
Even though she never went to school, she believed in education.
When I was seventeen, Kausalya Auntie told me that a good boy from a good family, the Ramasamy family, was interested in me, even since seeing me at the wedding of one of my cousins.
I knew Siram a little.
He was handsome, and well educated; and he worked in his father’s shop.
When I was of age, I said yes.
Once his family had made the formal proposal, Siram used to come by.
Six months later we were married.
In the beginning, everything went well.
He wasn’t cruel, and once in a while he would buy me a book because he knew I liked to read.
Often we would talk about the things we were reading.
When I told him I thought I was pregnant he was really excited, and when I miscarried he was crushed.
When I miscarried a second time, I felt like something snapped.
He stopped talking about having kids and pretty soon he lost all interest in having sex with me.
When I would try and move close to him in bed at night, he would turn away saying that he was tired and that he had to get up early to go to work.
Eventually, being in bed with me became dull, cold and repelling to him.
When Bala got married and my father-in-law asked Siram and Bala to take turns keeping watch, my husband would be excited when his turn came.
He had another woman in his life.
My life was like a boat left high and dry on the beach, like an inkpot without any ink.
My aunt, my mother-in-law and my sister-in-law were all aware of my situation but they all advised me to act as if everything was fine.
Later, when Bala married, I found a friend.
Ratna could talk to her husband at least, and when she felt that it was time fort her to leave, she left with the support of her husband.
I too wanted to ecape the prison I was in.
I asked Siram if I could help them in the supermarket.
I could be the cashier but, no, they already had a cashier.
That’s right, that woman got herself a place.
I, his lawful wife, didn’t even have that privilege.
Siram started to drink excessively.
Bala tried to explain things to me.
Poor Siram!
That woman was doing him in.
On top of it all, the alcohol made him impotent.
How does such an intelligent man become a total wreck?
I wan't so young anymore, but I knew that if I didn't do something, I would definitely turn into a wreck too.
Only Bala knew my plans.
He felt bad for Siram, but he understood.
I needed to leave this prison that was suffocating me.
May be I didn't pick the best time, but my priority was my own life.
It was lucky that Ratna let me stay with her until I could find some work.
Chapter 6.
In Danfour.
Once I had qualified as a teacher and gotten experience, I requested a position in Danfour.
The inspector in charge of my file couldn't believe his eyes.
Miss Ratna, is it true that you want to work in Danfour?
May I know why?
When I was much younger, I was in trouble.
A lady who wasn't even a relative took me in, and fed my body and my mind.
She gave me a great gift: belief.
You mean hope.
No, Mr Imambocus, belief.
The knowledge that God never abandons his children.
What was her name?
The lady’s.
Khadija Auntie.
Ha!… And why Danfour?
Because if we all work together, may be we can restore belief in Danfour.
Inspector Imambocus recommended me.
There were teachers’ quarters on the school grounds.
They were basic but adequate.
The work was hard.
Most of the kids were from single -parent homes, mostly single mothers and the kids were not well-fed.
The older kids looked after the younger ones.
They came to school without slates, chalk, notebooks or textbooks.
The school gave them a piece of bread and a cup of milk thanks to the generosity of KaviRam, an NGO.
If Uni-City lived in the eternal glory of immediate and immense profits, Danfour lived on charity.
Most of the people in Danfour were farmers who had lost their land, people who had lost their livelihood because communal property had been privatised, and people who had lost their homes because developers had cheated them.
One day I met Solange, who had lived in Mimi Camp a long time ago.
There had been a lot of development (bridges, highways, buildings, bungalows), but the houses that had been promised to the inhabitants has never materialised.
Many young girls were forced to become sex workers.
In the daytime, they slept in shanties and at night they made their living in the red light district.
Luckily, there were a few dedicated social workers who helped people regain some of their dignity.
But swimming against the current is no easy task.
Often, either because they were exhausted or because they had no resources, or because they didn’t get any support from the Autonomous Administration, they quit, and then another candle of hope was extinguished.
Compared to other people, I did fine.
I had a regular salary, a roof above my head, and a job I enjoyed, even if the work conditions were tough.
I was still young, full of energy and grit.
All things considered, I had no right to complain.
In Danfour, me and others like me formed a solidarity network. We had two reasons:  first, to prevent loneliness from weighing too heavily on us; second, to become interdependent since so many of our problems were connected.
Once in a while, members of different NGOs would meet socially and professionally.
We were a handful of people who had great hope that tomorrow would be better.
At one of those meetings — I don't really remember if it was a social one or a working session — I got a real surprise.
Bala yes, my Bala was there, together with his boyfriend, Gerard.
And that's not all.
Who else do you think was there?
Sita Auntie.
Gérard was the only one I didn’t know.
I knew of his existence, but we hadn’t met.
He wanted to be a priest, but he left the seminary once he came to terms with his sexual orientation.
But his faith in Jesus wasn’t diminished.
Quite the opposite: because he was honest with himself, his faith shone with a thousand colours of the rainbow.
We were a small group, like-minded in our aims and activities.
All of us were between forty and fifty years old, and we had all traveled through a fire that can burn you, but which can purify you if you know how to stick through it, we all wanted to slow down the deterioration, physical, social, and especially moral.
Each one of us was a Uni-City reject.
Danfour was our apocalypse, the harbinger of the end of this Roman Empire that was oppressing us.
Gerard was a natural-born leader, a genius at organising; Bala and I were good on the ground, because we knew how to talk to people, how to use their own turns of phrase to help them realise what was going on.
As for Sita Auntie—I don't know why I still called her Auntie—she knew how to build women’s confidence so that they could begin to take their fate into their own hands.
She had a special way of talking.
There was a group of twenty-somethings in Danfour who became attracted to the idea of armed resistance.
Uni-City was swimming in money, whereas Danfour was drowning in misery.
All channels of communication were blocked and the gap between these two realities was growing.
The Autonomous Administration stopped providing even minimal services in Danfour because it didn't contribute financially to activities.
Roads weren't paved; there was no rubbish pick-up; the drains were all blocked; dead animals rotted on the streets.
There was the serious danger of a cholera outbreak.
The banknote blinders covering the eyes of the Autonomous Administration and the Greater Finances Corporation, which controlled 90% of the region's wealth, meant that they didn't realise that any kind of catastrophe would in fact affect everyone.
The more people were excluded and marginalised, the more safety would be a concern for everyone.
The moderates formed a political party which they called the KaviRam Party.
Who would have thought it would be possible to soften Mammon’s shield and inject into it the thinking of Jesus Christ and Mahatma Gandhi.
But the population of Danfour, who were having difficulty just making ends meet, weren't interested in highflying rhetoric.
The memory of recent duplicity traumatised them.
They became fatalistic.
Violent rhetoric was more attractive to them.
Was social work enough?
Digging a hole and filling it up again?
Using spit to put out a fire?
I had doubts often, which broke my stride.
God, why couldn't I have Gérard’s moral strength!
As for Sita Auntie, she was like Sita in the Ramayana.
She said she knew that being exiled in Danfour was just a hell we had to go through on the way to our Moksha.
She thought her Moksha wasn’t far off and that belief helped her face difficulties.
But one night, on her way to see me, a group of hoodlums attacked her, even though they knew she was part of our group.
They beat her, robbed her, raped her and left her unconscious, in some thorn bushes.
The next day, when her body was discovered, it was covered in red ants but she was still alive.
There was this free dispensary run by volunteers, which was where she was first treated.
There was no ambulance to take her to the hospital.
Someone with an old beat-up car offered to take her.
That's how her life was saved.
But she was infected with the AIDS virus.
Her Moksha now seemed very far off.
When the news of her ‘accident’ spread, many women came to see her to give their support.
They formed a women’s self-defense organisation.
They even built a place where a local could stay.
They called it “Papernoula”.
A lot of men came to help them.
In spite of the lack of interest in social action among the majority of people, every time there was a tragedy, there spontaneously arose a small solidarity movement and a little light appeared where no-one expected it.
Belief was not just an idle word.
The hardest thing was finding a middle path between the repressive policy of the Autonomous Administration and armed resistance, a non-violent path, a specific one that would ensure social justice and greater happiness for many more people.
How to make social activism and political action work together in harmony?
There was a conflict between the Social and the Political.
Among the social workers were those who were anti-politics, for whom all politicians were liars, thieves, deceivers and the politicians saw adversaries everywhere, “those guys are plucking fruit from our orchard”, they’d say.
I myself had no political experience.
In fact, I rather mistrusted politicians, but I had a notion that it was possible to have the two work together.
According to Bala, I was a “voluntarist-idealist”.
It certainly was all mixed up in my head.
The leader of the KaviRam Party was called Dario Ravaton.
He had a lot of experience in social action, but always thought of it principally as a springboard for political action.
At the same time, social action, when it means consolidating effective lobbies, can become the basis of poltical success.
For him, these two work together; sometimes one takes priority over the other, sometimes it’s the other way around.
He refused to admit rigid divisions into a dynamic world.
But to succeed, we had to be sure we didn’t forget what the source of our problems was.
I understood his ideas because we met often.
Dario’s daughter was in my class.
She had trouble with her studies.
I don't think she was dyslexic, but she was disturbed by something that had happened.
I made a request that her father or mother come see me so I could understand the child.
Dario came.
He made me understand that he was a single parent.
One day, his wife just upped and left them.
He hadn’t blamed her because he wasn’t a model husband himself.
Ever since that day, he looked after his two children with the help of a neighbour.
His daughter, Jessica, was very affected by her mother’s departure.
I offered to look after the kids in the afternoon, after school, if he didn't have any objections.
He had none.
Slowly, Jessica began to open up.
One afternoon, when he came to pick her up, he gave me a bottle of red wine and a red rose.
What’s the occasion?
I just want to.
Why don’t you stay?
I'll cook something, we can eat together.
David will be alone, I left him with a neghbour.
Then go get him!
As things deteriorated, the violence started to cast its net much wider.
The youth became increasingly impatient.
They called their movement, Maw-Maw.
It wasn’t clear whether they were Mao-Mao or Mau Mau.
One day I asked one of the leaders which it was.
He stared at his big toes for two or three seconds before saying, “Both!”.
In Uni-City, well-intentioned people began to say that if something wasn’t done soon, violence would become the norm.
One can't just talk about economic growth without taking stock of the deterioration on the social side.
An independent state can’t just be an enabler, letting the rich get richer.
It has to provide for the poor, the sick, the elderly, the handicapped; it has to provide education and health to all people.
These well-intentioned people weren’t organised; they had no influence on those who decided.
The press, which was in the pocket of big money, censored them, even though they themselves were officially against censorship.
Because open debate was silenced, violence became the standard reaction of the victims of all the heartless development.
Chapter 7.
First Signs.
In the boardroom of FoulousPlennti, Inc.
Chairperson:  Stop messing around, you all!
According to certain scientists, what’s going on is just a warning.
Very soon the situation is going to become far more delicate and far more serious.
Member 1: The scientists are saying any old thing, talking the usual nonsense.
I have scientists in my army who are willing to prove the opposite as long as we go along with them.
Member 2: Supposing it’s true, let’s use both science and technology to resolve the problem.
Chairperson: That’s the problem.
According to the experts, technology can’t fix the problems that technology created.
Member 10: What’s all this rubbish?
Technology has a solution for everything.
Chairperson: And yet, it hasn’t been able to put more marbles in your brain!
Everyone laughs.
OK, enough joking.
Our recent investments are all a washout.
Member 12:  You’re too funny, Mr President.
It’s true!
The seaside bungalows are almost all in the water, a real washout.
Ha!  Ha!  Very funny!
Chairperson: Number 12, stop being an idiot.
Member 12: Yes, Mr President.
Chairperson: The buyers of the deluxe bungalows are claiming their rights.
In the contract, there’s a clause which says that if the water floods their property, then we, as sellers, must compensate them for damages.
If we pay according to the leteter of the law, we'll be bankrupt.
Are you done laughing, Number 12?
Member 12: There is a solution, Mr President, if you'll allow me.
Chairperson:  Allow you!
Member 12: What if a bomb fell on our town and destroyed everything, would we have to pay any compensation?
Member 7: Stop wasting our time, dickhead!
Member 9: There really ought to be a tax on talk.
All: Yes! Yes! Yes! A tax on talk!
A tax on talk!
Chairperson: Wait, the idiot’s right.
All: Huh!?
Chairperson: The rising water is a natural disaster against which we've given our clients a guarantee, that’s why they put all their black money into our business.
But a bomb, that’s not a natual disaster.
Member 10: That’s what I was saying.
Chairperson: Good God!
You’re right.
There ought to be a tax on talk.
All: Yes! Yes! Yes!
Chairperson: Hold on!
What if there’s a political solution.
All: Political?
Chairperson: Yes, political.
In Danfour, we can find a sucker who’ll be able to do this for a little quick cash.
Member 5: Do what?
Chairperson: Look, we get a group of delinquents together, arm them, call them the Danfour Liberation Movement, and then give them what they need to blow up the waterfront bungalows.
Member 4: But there security cameras, the guards, the police patrols.
Chairperson: The Surveillance, Safety and Security Company, we control the SSS.
We'll instruct them to keep watch with their eyes closed.
I'll speak to the Chief Minister of the Autonomous Administration.  Autonomous!
Makes you laugh.
Even the shirt on his back doesn’t belong to him!
For one week, we’ll have the police patrol the hillsides instead.
Member 1: Isn’t what we’re planning a little drastic?
Why don’t we just bulldoze the hills and use that earth to keep the sea at bay?
Chairperson: Haven’t you heard of global warming?
Climate change?
The melting of the North and South poles?
Well, haven’t you?
You can’t stop the water.
If you build a dyke, the dyke will break.
Any anyway, our job isn’t to stop the water rising, it’s to maximise the profits of our shareholders, and right away.
I make a motion that you give me the authority to carry out this plan.
Don’t forget something else.
According to my information, the KaviRam Movement is becoming popular.
I tried to buy off Dario Ravaton.
He’s a stubborn one.
Let’s kill two birds with one stone.
We’ll spread a rumour that an armed branch of KaviRam is destroying everything.
Member 2: But isn’t it a non-violent movement?
Member 12: The bigger the lie, the more effective it is.
We'll sling as much mud as possible.
The KaviRam people will try to remove as much as they can.
They can try and clean it, rub it off, wash it off, whatever they do, they'll still have some mud on them.
Chairperson: Hey, idiot, you’re not an idiot at all.
Where did you get this idea?
Chairperson: One last thing.
Each gang will have only one mission, after which it will disappear.
There can’t be any witnesses.
There’ll be police investigations after each demolition, and they’ll result in shootouts at the hoodlums’ hideouts.
All: Congratulations, Boss!
You should be running the country.
Chairperson: That time is not far off.
Chapter 8.
In spite of its limited resources, our shelter, Papernoula, was able to help out about a dozen families.
When I was a little better, the membersasked me to look after the shelter full-time.
This offer was a gift from God for me.
My Mokshha took a form I would never have expected.
I didn’t know how long I had left to live, but at least what little life I had left would have a clear direction and purpose.
In the yard outside the shelter we grew vegetables and raised chickens, rabbits and goats.
But without the help of a philanthropist, we would not have been able to make ends meet, and those who were HIV-positive would not get any treatment.
There were greedy financiers aplenty, but there was a handful of people who were troubled by the poverty of the people that the system threw into the rubbish dump.
One day, the secretary of Mr Verylively, who had been financing our shelter, came to see us to ask if we would let his employer come over for a visit.
No-one had any objections.
He was very old.
He believed in doing charity because, for him, giving to the poor was like lending to God.
But once I told him that it’s not charity that would save us but economic power, he became uneasy.
He didn't seem to understand.
“You don’t want me to help you?”
No, don’t misunderstand us, Mr Robert.
Your help is precious indeed, but it doesn’t help us stand on our own feet.
I don’t really understand.
I am accustomed to thinking in a particular way, but now it seems there’s another way of.
No, I’m sorry, I'm the one who isn’t explaining it properly.
I really appreciate your coming here.
Do come see us whenever you have time.
Time I have in abundance.
So much time, but.
You know, people in my family, they think differently.
I no longer know what to think, since.
I’ll tell you another time.
Ever since that day, his contributions increased and his visits became more frequent.
He needed us just as much as we needed him.
Was this alliance natural, or unnatural?
I thought it was quite normal, but there were badmouthers who were slinging mud.
I found flowers from the flame-trees at the end of the lane and on the edge of the ravine, once again.
There was a lot of violence in Danfour, as well as in Uni-City.
News spread of seaside bungalows in Uni-City being bombed and exploding one after the other, and of gunfights between the police and ‘terrorists’, who were dying in droves.
Many of the young people who had gotten in on the plan hatched by the Chairperson of FoulousPlennti and his accomplices ended up dead.
In Danfour, there was a different kind of violence.
The victims were usually women and children.
It was as if the stress and frustration made people dump their crap on the weak and defenseless.
The Papernoula shelter received many more requests for help from.
Without Robert’s help we could never have survived.
One day, a car stopped outside the shelter and the driver got down and handed me an envelope.
It was a letter from Robert inviting me to come to his place for dinner.
I hesitated, unsure what I shoud do.
I asked my friends what they thought and they all advised me to go.
That night, Robert’s car came to fetch me.
I felt antsy in his house but Robert did whatever he could to put me at ease.
Sita, there’s something I have to tell you.
I don’t have long to live.
Don’t say that!
I’m being serious.
I have cancer and soon I’m going to ask my doctor to put me to sleep.
Would you sit by me when the time comes?
I have no-one.
I had two children, a girl and a boy, they would have been your age.
There was a helicopter accident.
Shh!  Let me finish.
I have a lot of money, an empire.
but today I have no-one to hold my hand as I take my last steps, no-one besides you.
Please don’t worry.
I will be there.
Sita, what I’m asking of you is against the law.
You could go to prison.
I don’t have long to live either.
I know you’re HIV-positive.
Don’t be afraid.
One day they’ll find a cure.
Don’t lose hope.
I have something else to tell you.
I’ve decided to bequeath my empire.
The principal beneficiary will be Papernoula.
My lawyer has already prepared the legal papers.
He’ll explain all the details.
Right, let’s have dinner now.
There was a nice spread, but I’d lost my appetite.
The next day I asked Ratna, Dario, Bala and Gerard to come meet me on an urgent matter.
They thought my health had gotten worse.
When I told them about the Father Christmas, their jaws fell open.
We all worried about only one thing.
Easy money might make us leave the straight and narrow, and there was the real danger that opportunists would descend on us en masse.
Chapter 9.
The sea level kept rising.
Everywhere a sweltering heat burned.
The elderly and infants were among the first victims.
Water started running out.
Breathing was becoming difficult.
Then, after a long drought, there were torrential rains.
Several violent cyclones passed over the island and the drenched earth could no longer take any water.
There were landslides and building began to crumble.
The landslides were sometimes spectacular, almost as if there was an earthquake.
Between the sea and the hillside there was now a canal through which small boats could navigate.
Our area’s appearance changed completely.
The natural surroundings had been martyred, it was as if a giant was shaking the dust off his coat and adjusting his body.
Property prices plummeted.
The recession spread its tentacles everywhere.
The economy crashed.
In Danfour too there were problems, but they weren't as serious.
Two good things were happening there.
First of all, the lay of the land was a plus because there was now a direct link between Danfour and the sea.
Second, the stress-free muddling along, with people looking after Nature which looked after people—rather than people trample all over Nature—meant that a less drastic situation developed.
In spite of widespread death and destruction, it was still possible for people to have a relatively manageable life.
On the other hand, the situation in Uni-City was catastrophic.
It was as if Nature had an account to settle, and it was settling it with a vengeance.
When the youth in Danfour realised just how vulnerable Uni-City was, they descended upon it and looted the stores and the bungalows that had been abandoned or were in ruins.
It was impossible not to prevent chaos from reigning.
Private security, the police, nothing worked.
When it became clear that Uni-City was going to end up like Pompeii, the economic and political leaders made a hasty retreat.
Their money wasn't there anyway, it was in banks overseas.
But those in the middle class, the ones who had been fed by the silver spoons of Providence, now had to find a lifeline fast.
They quickly began to understand the need for solidarity with those experiencing hardship, not because they felt the sudden need to be philanthropic but because it was the only way for them to save their lives.
You see, Ratna, these types will want to find a way to whitewash themselves.
Then it’s just a question of not letting them into KaviRam.
You can’t stop them.
They can help.
Don’t forget, among them are doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers.
We need people like that.
But Dario!
How are we going to stop them from lording it over us?
There’s no miracle solution.
We have to organise the farmers, artisans and fishermen into co-ops which they run.
We have to be very vigilant.
Most importantly, we mus not repeat our earlier mistake: just thinking about filling pockets.
A habitat of several thousand souls would have to be rebuilt with very limited resources.
A huge challenge, that!
But there was no alternative.
The countries and neighbouring regions that might have been able to help us were worse off than we were.
We had to depend on our own strengths.
Bala liked to say that we were against radical change.
That change was acceptable as long as it was in the same direction as before.
Now, change outside our control had forced us to change our very orientation.
We had to re-invent our future, re-draw the contours of a new tomorrow.
We were in an impasse.
Would the flame-trees bloom this year?
What folklore is and why we collect it.
Two views of Folklore.
All Mauritians, as well as visitors to Mauritius, know about the sega, the intense, exciting, hip-swinging dance, which combines African and Indian elements.
When the word folklore is mentioned,the sega is what many people think of.
They connect it with another way of life which is bound to disappear, if it hasn’t disappeared already.
A 1972 newspaper photograph showed cane cutters with a caption, “C'est le passé qui revient, c’est une facon de vivre.”
Cane cutting and cane cutters are still with us.
As to the sega,people in Mauritius have been declaring it dead or dying since 1830.
Charles Baissac, the Mauritian folklorist, confidently predicted in the 1880’s that the sega would disappear.
Fortunately, it hasn’t disappeared, though it has undergone some changes.
Another view of folklore sees it as all the kinds of artistic communicating which people do in their lives.
Folklore in Mauritius,in this view, includes a great deal more than the sega and is performed by many more people than poor labourers.
Storytelling,dancing, games, riddling, singing, healing, and telling jokes are all forms of folklore.
They are activities which a family, a group of friends, or a community engage in.
This is what folklore means in this book: a form of communication, which all people engage in.
Usually they communicate folklore face to face, but they can do it in writing (traditional prayers and sayings), by telephone (greeting and leave-taking formulas), radio (singing and storytelling), or television (festivals and celebrations).
Myths, folktales, legends, riddles, proverbs, sayings, oaths, charms, blessings and teases are examples of verbal folklore (folklore in words).
When verbal folklore focuses on the events or not able people ofthe past, it is often called oral traditions.
Other forms, partly involving words, are folksong (part words, part music), beliefs, superstitions, customs, dances, plays and games.
Some physical movements or gestures are the common property of a group and are thus folklore.
Ways of dressing, especially on ceremonial occasions, ways of building houses, tools used in farming or work, vessels used in cooking, furniture, foods, decorations and folk art, are also kinds of folklore.
One way in which people make use of folklore is to strengthen their sense of belonging to a group.
People who tell stories in Bhojpuri, say proverbs in Hakka, or carry out local religious observances in Tamil are confirming their membership in their group, almost unconsciously.
Children learn what it is to be an Indo-Mauritian, a Sino-Mauritian, or a Franco-Mauritian by learning the ways, proverbs, riddles, and stories of the group.
It is like learning a language.
Another use of folklore is to control behavior.
Proverbs, songs and folktales symbolically communicate the message that certain behaviour is approved and other behavior is not approved.
For instance, a folktale about a girl who refuses all suitors and then marries a wolf-man points to what can happen to a girl who marries without her parents’ approval.
A third use of folklore is to give a dignified and powerful character to the past and present of the group.
An example is the legend of the pearl island, which comes out of the Ramayana and which connects Mauritius to India.
Rama has been exiled and is living peacefully in the forest with his wife Sita and younger brother Lakshman.
Then Surpankha, the sister of Ravana, appears and wishes to marry the princes Rama and Lakshman.
They refuse.
She attacks Sita, and Lakshman slices off her nose and ears.
Then her brothers Kahar and Dushan attempt to counterattack and are killed by Rama.
Surpankha’s brother Ravana consults the magician Mareech, who transforms himself into a deer, approaches Sita, and is shot by Rama.
Mareech’s corpse changes into different sized pearls, which Rama throws southward.
The pearls fall in the Indian Ocean and grow into islands there.
One of those islands is Mauritius.
In the legend, Mauritius is said to be spiritually connected to India.
Naturally, not everyone in Mauritius will feel or should feel that connection, but anyone can see how the legend makes the link between the countries.
One way of seeing folklore around you, therefore, is to look for things people do that strengthen their sense of belonging.
Why collect such things?
Mauritians should begin to look at their own folklore, simply because it is their own and it is valuable.
Folklore and oral traditions should be recorded and preserved in Mauritius for their own worth and for their use in understanding and advancing the nation.
Cultural activities like storytelling and singing of traditional songs exist all through life.
Folktale, oral tradition, and folksong are found among the richest people as among the poorest.
The beauty of a tale or song, like the beauty of a bracelet near a pot, comes out of the qualities we see in it.
The story or song makes us feel a certain way.
It reminds us of old times.
It should make us proud to be who we are.
When we listen to a folktale or dance a sega, it arouses our feelings and emotions.
We say, it’s beautiful?
So the primary value of Mauritian folklore is that it is emotionally important to us, dear to us.
In order for us to have these experiences available to our children and their children, traditions must be preserved.
This doesn’t mean they must always be practiced.
It means they must be recorded, so that our children can know about their traditions and decide what they want to preserve.
That is why tales, songs, riddles, proverbs, house types, clothes, ways of cookery and pieces of folk art deserve your attention.
Though new folklore is constantly being created, many Mauritians today feel their past to be slipping out of reach.
Since independence,‘Mauritius has seen many changes and new prosperity.
Some people feel nostalgic about their past.
Their attitude is justified by the fact that here as everywhere in the world, individual items of folklore do die out.
When the British antiquary Thomas coined the word folklore in 1846, he felt this same nostalgia about British “manners, customs, observances, superstitions, ballads, proverbs, etc. of the olden time".
Moreover, the attitude that culture is endangered has helped to bring into existence the funds and the institutional support for field research.
The Ministry of Cultural Affairs has directed the Mahatma Gandhi institute, as well as other institutions, to retrieve elements of ancestral culture which are fast disappearing.
Perhaps in the future, the Mahatma Gandhi Institute will create and archive for the materials you collect.
Is this effort simply a form of communalism?
Rather it means being committed to revealing the full humanity and artistry of every person and group in Mauritius.
It means finding and alternative to the growing sameness of modern life.
Clothes, food, language, work, and tastes in Mauritius are becoming more and more alike.
Mauritians are free to decide whether to preserve or let go of traditional clothes, traditional foods, or traditional proverbs.
But they should make their choices on the basis of a knowledge of tradition, not on ignorance.
Going back to old proverbs or sayings, hearing old songs again, or remembering family stories can remind one that the differences between groups of people mean a great deal, than that all groups in Mauritius have a history worth knowing.
This field manual is a tool of such retrieval.
Who are the Folk?
What groups do this artistic communication called folklore?
All people who make known to one another their thoughts, feelings, knowledge, and hopes - that is, all groups,whether they are families, clans, villages, roomfuls of factory workers or cane cutters, politicians, estate managers.
All these groups are made up of persons who communicate with one another face to face over time.
One of their kinds of communication is "folklore event" - a single telling of a story, performance of a custom, or preparation of a traditional meal.
A folklore event is that moment when a person A says or does an action B for the other person C in the presence of the audience D.
A,B,C, and D (however many they are) are the participants in the event.
Of course, score of the persons in C and D may be outsiders, more or less (I think of the huge numbers of guests at a Hindu wedding).
Folklore events happen again and again.
Some features remain the same, others are different.
The folklorist observes and records these sameness and differences.
In modern Mauritian life, everyone is a member of more than one folk group.
To begin, everyone speaks more than one language, whether Creole, Bhojpuri, French, English, Hindi, or Tamil.
Thus members of some Mauritian groups are linked by their languages.
Other linking factors are their geographical region and their religion.
Every family is also a folk group with tradition of its own.
Also, an especially rich group for folklore study is members Of the same occupation — sugar estate, docks, school.
People who are connected by their place and conditions of work always develop traditions of their own.
So far, we know little about Mauritian occupational folklore.
A study of the sayings, speech, stories, and customs characteristic of Port Louis dock workers, the police, or the Special Mobile Force would show how important folklore is in defining groups.
A folk group always has its own stories or customs.
These are common property within the group, but not outside.
They keep reappearing in more or less the same words or the stone form.
If you recognise yourself in these groups, it is probably because all persons in their lifetime pass through a number of folk groups.
You could begin your collecting of folklore just there.
Try observing the people around you to discover what folk groups they belong to now, or in the past.
This idea itself would be worthy of study.
Ask yourself or your family: Do you know people who practice old-time curing or other such customs?
What’s your attitude towards them and what they do?
Describe what they do.
Do you know people who look down on traditional ways of curing or healing?
Other old-time customs?
What do people tell you about customary behaviour that started many years ago, but that is not done nowadays?
These questions will make you wonder about how the users of folklore themselves think about their material.
What ideas do the storyteller think his story points to?
What does he think the story means?
What behavior is being encouraged?
The idea that folklore can be found mostly among ignorant or uneducated people is wrong.
Educated people perform it too.
The idea that folklore means ignorance, illiteracy, and savage customs is also wrong.
Literate, highly cultivated people also belong to folk groups.
Because all persons belong to folk groups, all persons participate in folklore.
In the past people did not know that.
During colonial times, European governments taught colonised people that foreign languages, customs, beliefs and culture were natural and right, and that their old ways were unnatural and wrong.
Today, there is no basis for believing that Mauritian culture is hybrid, or deteriorated, or degenerate.
Some of this country’s customs and art originated in India, Africa, or China and migrated here.
Then they developed independently.
Mauritian songs, tales,and customs are wise, witty, and beautiful.
They need only to be recorded and published for the world to acknowledge their beauty.
Mauritian folklore also has a value in building the nation.
By revealing people’s ideas of good and bad and identifying the parts of their life about which they have bad feelings, folklore gives us the finest information about what is important to them.
Culture,says the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture, "means the preservation of local assets and the understanding, appreciation and adoption of universal values."
It means also the clever and beautiful ways which people have found to solve problems that come up over and over for everyone.
The problem all Mauritians have faced is how to preserve their own reality in the face of extreme differences from other people around them.
The result is that all the members of any group know something often other groups, and many members areas proficient in the cultural activities of other groups as of their own".
When you collect stories or songs, you can expect to witness that proficiency.
People will switch from Creole to Bhojpuri and back again.
They will switch also among different customs and traditions.
What is more, knowing or participating in the traditions of the groups does not take away form the sense of identity which is shared in the group.
As one anthropologist points out about language in the Caribbean, speakers and addressees are not and probably are not encouraged to expect to become members of the same social group.
This proficiency in the traditions of different groups has served people throughout Mauritian history as a means of adaptation to new circumstances.
For all Mauritian groups, "cultural resilience and adaptation might indeed be regarded as the most outstanding as well as the most persistent form of resistant: to the legal, spatial, economic, psychological, and health controls with which they have been surrounded.
Nation-building depends upon understanding this proficiency and this resilience.
Since this manual is meant as a tool, it contains more questions than answers.
You don’t satisfy your hunger by reading a cookery book.
More examples would make the manual more fun to read.
You, the reader, will have to collect them.
Change in folklore.
When a story, song, or proverb moves away from the time, place, or people of its origin, it often changes.
Stories change their language; songs change their tunes; proverbs mean something different.
Meaning change; the use to which folklore is put changes.
Audiences are different in a new place, so that what was religious story for Muslims sounds like only an interesting tale to others.
There is nothing wrong with change.
It cannot be stopped.
The changes that happen to items of folklore make it necessary for you to record the actual time, place, and persons of the performance.
Expect to find variant forms that differ from the ones you already know.
Variant forms are not “wrong", only different.
Sometimes variant forms are created by clever people.
Children, for instance, often invent variant forms of songs or sayings they hear on television.
Then your record can be compared with the records,left by others.
Comparison will bring an understanding of the nature of change.
The main tools for comparison of folktales, for instance are Stith Thompson’s MotfIndex of Folk Literature and Aame and Thompson’s Types of the folktale.
hese show the variant forms of folktales and legends around the world.
General Direction for collectors.
This manual can be used by anyone who can read and write.
You can do valuable collection by asking only a few people a few of the questions below.
You do not have to work your way through all of the manual.
The best plan will be for you and others to do your collecting and send your materials to a central place.
This scheme - having collectors all over the country sending materials to a central archive — is based on the folklore achievements of the small nation of Ireland, which has a valuable lesson to teach.
Like Mauritius, ireland was for centuries a poor British colony, where many people could read and write.
Soon after it gained independence, lreland set up a Govemment agency, the irish Folklore Commission, to observe and record folklore all over the country.
A few folklorists made field recordings and watched over the central archives.
Most of the actual collecting, though,was done by ordinary persons - teachers, priests, school pupils.
These persons did their collecting by working throughout the Handbook of Irish Folklore, a set of questionnaires put out by the Commission to show what folklore might be found.
The Irish book is the model for this book.
By 1962, the lrish Folklore Commission had put together a million pages of handwritten folklore information.
When Mauritius, with its many languages and traditions, decides to follow the example of ireland, people can use this manual in the same way.
most important body of knowledge about culture and tradition in the Indian Ocean.
When the archives comes into existence, it will be consulted by folklorists, historians, and anthropologists from all over the world.
Your first quality should be patience.
As a folklore collector,you need a willingness to listen at length to peoples stories about themselves, their discussions, their comments and the principles they imply.
At the same time, you need not expect that people can explain themselves or their traditions.
People may know very well what they are doing without being able to tell you in words.
What the Chinese community tells us is equally true of all Mauritians.
If you ask a modern Chinese the meaning of rites of the ancestors, you usually put him into great embarrassment, because nobody ever asked him before.
Most Chinese will insist on the element of remembrance and respect for the ancestors, but most Mauritians will simply tell you, "It’s always done this way".
The next question should be not "Why?" but "Was it always like that, or has it changed?"
Your second quality should be absolute faithfulness to what people say and do.
The words people say or sing in their folklore must be written down just as they are said.
Make no change in the words that person says or sings.
Don’t correct the language or the tune.
Whatever language(s) are being used, record the words accurately.
The easiest means to accurate recording is a cassette tape recorder, which will help you resist any temptation to change, for example, Creole into schoolbook French.
Speak Creole to Creole speakers, Bhojpuri to Bhojpuri speakers, and listen carefully when they switch from one language to another.
Even very small or seemingly unimportant words or behavior need to be recorded.
What is usual in one part of the island may be unusual or unknown in another.
Therefore, record all sorts of traditionnal words and behavior, even what you have already recorded from other persons or in other neighborhoods.
The more times a single tale or proverb is written down, the more we will know about folklore in Mauritius.
Choose times and places to collect when people are more likely to be able to remember.
If someone you are questioning does not know example of tales, riddles, or something else you are looking for, make a note of his or her lack of knowledge.
Adults know fewer riddles than children; wedding customs are easier to observe at a wedding than afterward; most folktales are told at night,not in the daytime.
Transcribe on to paper the folklore you have observed, either while questioning the people or (if you use a tape recorder) as soon as possible afterward.
Use large paper; write clearly; use only one side of the page.
Leave white space of 3 cm at the top and left and 2 cm at the right and bottom, to make the pages readable if they are bound together later.
At the start or end of each bit you record, state the name, age,and place ofthe person(s) whose words are being written down.
Or begin your tape recording by saying that information into your microphone: "It is May 17, l990, and we are in Fond du Sac, talking to Antoine Mamet".
It is most important to record correctly the person from whom each story or other tradition has been taken.
Find out something about each person’s life history.
Has he/she always lived in that place?
Who were his/her father and mother?
What languages were spoken at home?
How does he/she make a living?
All these facts will help to show how and where a person came into touch with the folklore he/she knows.
If you want to specialize in recording people’s life histories, see "Life Histories" below.
Many sorts of folklore have not yet been collected in Mauritius, though they are certainly there.
Proverbs, riddles, beliefs about witchcraft, cookery, and folk architecture have hardly been written down.
Stories about dead people coming back to talk with living people, which are found all over the world, are almost unknown in Mauritius so far.
This field manual tries to tell what will be found, but you should take every chance to think up questions of your own which you base on the questions here.
Keep copies.
Once you collect and write down your material,you should make two copies.
Keep one copy for yourself.
When a central archive is created, send another copy to that archive.
The reason folklore materials are put together in an archive is that Mauritians and foreign scholars need to compare the traditions of various members of each group, to examine everything that is known about the traditions of Mauritius, and to compare Mauritian folklore with the folklore of La Reunion, Seychelles, Madagascar,India, Africa and Europe.
Should you pay your informants?
There is no money to be gained from collecting folklore.
Under Mauritian law, an artist and a collector may agree to work with each other by means of a contract; no money changes hands.
Many sega performers, however, have been recorded by persons who then made profits from their music by selling cassettes but giving no money to the artist.
Therefore, many people think anyone interested in traditional culture will be bound to profit from it.
Be prepared to answer the question, "How much money are you going to make out of what I tell you?
The real answer, ofcourse, is that traditional culture is a treasure of the nation.
But if you intend to sell folklore materials which you record, the law requires you to sign a different kind of contract with the artist to make sure he or she receives the profits.
Consult the Mauritius Society of Authors in Ebene.
Some authorities urge you not to pay for information in cash, but to try to make a gift or perform some service for a person who has given you her time and effort.
She is your co-worker, after all.
Others have found that paying for stories and songs is a fine way to encourage people to make up new ones, which can then be compared with the old ones.
Decide this for yourself.
You will need to think about what place you have, as a collector of folklore, in the local community.
If you come to the place as an outsider, people will expect you to act as an outsider and will try to extend hospitality to you.
Being a foreigner, I’ve had that experience many times.
If you are a local school teacher, you may need to make it clear that you are stepping out of your usual behavior as a teacher and taking up, for the moment, a new place.
If they think you are a government officer, they may treat you as more important than they are, putting aside their own desires, thoughts, and feelings.
Then they cannot be expected to show you freely what is important to them in their past or in their communal life.
In fact, informants are more important than collectors, and you will need to let people know that you think so.
Where to start.
The recording of Mauritian folklore can be carried out on a large scale or a small one.
To begin with, you might sit in on an exchange of riddles by local children, to see how they do it.
You should be able to ask the older children, at least, how the game is played.
Or you might hear people singing songs as they do their daily work; then you could ask singers to sing them to you, so that the words can be written down.
If you are collecting in your home community, you can begin looking carefully at how people behave at weddings, births, funerals, and other important occasions.
Observe what people do and say; write notes about the social and physical conditions; record or write the words and behavior ofthe people.
Also in your home community, you could make a list of the folk groups (schoolchildren, married women, unmarried men, and ofcourse families).
It may be better to start collecting from the people most like yourself young men if you are a young man, married women if you are a married woman.
Often you will find and get help from and "active tradition bearer".
This phrase describes a person who is more interested in tradition, or is a better storyteller, or has responsibility for family history.
Since an active tradition bearer has always enjoyed an audience, he/she is well known to all.
Nelzir Ventre of Poudre d’Or, Ti-Frer (Alphonse Ravaton) of Quartier Militaire, the brothers Sydney and Jocelyn Joseph of Grand Bel Air near Mahébourg, Fanfan the segatye are well known in their neighborhood and beyond.
You can ask this person, as well as other people, how he/she got his place in the community.
One of the important duties of Mauritian folklorist is to find active tradition bearers and get them better known.
Observing Observances.
After you have recorded some tales, proverbs, legends, riddles and songs, you may decide to try something more ambitious like a public observance.
Celebrations, calendar customs, and rituals are what many people think of when Mauritian folklore is mentioned.
All Mauritians know Grand Bassin, Eid, spring festival, Easter, Cavadee and other festivals that attract many tourists.
Up to now, however, very little systematic, painstaking observation of these customs has been made.
One reason for this lack is the difficulty of observing everything that is going on in a complex event.
Even in a relatively straightforward event like a pilgrimage, hundreds of persons carry out many different kinds of activities.
The worship of Ammen, the Tamil mother goddess, brings hundreds together to take part in different ways.
We might take what seems a relatively manageable example Of a complex observance, the Haldi ceremony the night before a Hindu weddings.
In this ceremony, the bride-to-be is anointed and then segregated from other people.
In addition to the prescribed ritual activities carried out by the priest, the person(s) to be married, and the members of their family, you would have to observe many other activities.
These are "unofficial" and “in formal".
While they are part of the whole event, they are neither sacred nor prescribed by scripture or priests.
The way in which an outdoor area has been converted to an indoor area by being enclosed in a tent,the arrival and seating patterns of hundred of guests,the preparation and serving of their food.
their many informal conversations surrounding the central area,and the kinds of folkloric communication going on within and outside the house.
As for you, the observer, you cannot be everywhere at the same time, you can’t even see everything directly in front of you, a videocamera will see less than you see yourself, and yet you are expected to record whatever is relevant to an accurate description of the whole ceremony.
The description of Haldi should aim at understanding where the official and formal elements leave off and the unofficial and informal elements begin.
Here are some questions to carry with you in field work in case you decide to investigate customary observance.
This list has been adapted from the classic work on the subject.
“A Guide for Field Workers in Folklore”, which you can consult for further guidance.
1. The Physical Setting.
Where are you, indoors,outdoors, or both?
Where is the house or other location?
What is the size and shape of the space that is being used?
Perhaps you can measure it before or after the event.
Make a sketch if the space is irregular.
How is the space used?
In a room, are there pictures on the walls, religious or other symbols,curtains, furniture?
Have chairs or other furniture been hired for the occasion?
Describe this transaction by interviewing family members or the dealer.
How is the space lighted?
What sounds do you hear - music, bird calls, dogs barking, automobiles passing?
What do you smell incense, wood fire, women’s perfumes, cooking odors, tobacco smoke?
What are the weather conditions and temperature?
2. The participants.
Make an accurate record of the identities and roles of the participants.
Many of these will be in groups, which you can describe (families sitting or standing together, children playing, old men chatting).
How many persons are present?
How many men, how many women?
What are their ages?
If you know some of them, record their names.
What position in the community do the main participants hold?
The minor participants?
The onlookers?
What relationship exist among the participants?
Where are they placed in the physical setting?
Describe their general appearance and dress (make photographs).
What role does each participant play in this event?
If the roles have traditional names, record these.
Who initiates the action?
Where do people direct their attention?
Do people converse with each other while performance is taking place?
What seems to be people’s attitude when many actions take place at the same time?
3. Performance.
"Performance" is the best word to denote the sequence in which some participants take responsibility for carrying out certain actions.
Describe this sequence of actions from beginning to end.
Who introduces performance?
Are separate performances going on at the same time?
Describe the actions of performers.
Observe and record recitation, singing, chanting, tone of voice, high or low pitch, vocal intensity, pauses, switching among languages, facial expressions, gestures, pantomime, imitating sounds or other persons` voices repetition.
What equipment is being used to support the performers - microphone, amplification, musical instruments, noise makers?
Is the performance being videotaped?
How does videotaping affect the performance?
Describe the responses of onlookers.
How do they show their evaluation of what is going on?
How do onlookers show their encouragement, disapproval, or other reaction (singing, laughing, shouting, yawning, applauding, weeping)?
Ask (now or later) for evaluation of this event from as many participants as you can.
Is this a good one of its kind?
What makes it so?
Is this a "normal" performance or does it differ in some way from the usual practice?
Ask experienced persons to discuss variation with you.
The performance of Mauritian folklore always differs from the way in which customs were performed in people’s countries of origin.
Therefore, observe and record as much as possible about the specific details of performance here.
Also, performance today is different from performance yesterday.
Therefore, record what people are actually doing today as well as what they say about what was formerly done.
Your accurate observation of present practice can then be used for comparison with what history and anthropology tell us about practices in the ancestral land.
How does your presence affect the performance?
What is your role?
Where are you located?
Can you move around to observe different parts of the events?
What is going well for you at this event?
What is hard for you?
4. Rules.
Folklore is always perfonned according to certain rules, which people know and which you should find out.
For instance, is there some part of the space where some person(s) should not go?
Is there some time when some person(s) should not speak?
What is the right time for holding this event?
What would be a wrong time for holding it?
What or who determines the right and wrong time?
Is this an official, formal determination or an unofficial, informal one?
Is the practice today different from what it was in former times?
Ask those present and record their exact words.
Note the exact order in which parts of the event occur.
What would happen if this order were varied?
What or who could interrupt or break up the event?
Writing a Folklore Report.
Your notes and observations can be sent in to the future archive,or to the Department of Folklore at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute,just as you have written them, or in more finished form.
If you decide to put your notes and observations into finished form, as an essay, begin with many full, detailed notes which contain anything you think might be relevant.
Remember that at first you are making note to yourself, not writing a report to the Minister.
Then comes the framing of a proposition (thesis, main idea) for your paper.
This should be a single sentence (hypothesis) which you will probably revise later.
A sample proposition might be, “The Mauritian fire-walking ceremony, while preserving many features of Tamil practice in India, contains many new elements which make it unique to Mauritius" or "the Haldi ceremony, whether Sanathari or Arya Samaj, is a microcosm of Hindu marriage because it symbolizes all the important features".
As you continue to observe the ceremony, you will reshape this sentence,but always bear in mind that you final paper must defend this single central idea.
All the details you have observed, when put in logical order, will support this sentence.

Recent History and Old Times.
The Folk Idea of Change.
In Mauritius, people are keenly aware of the speed of cultural and economic change in their own lives and experience.
Many (may be you) feel strongly that old traditions are threatened by such change.
If you tell them you are interested in folklore, they say, "Our generation has no folklore.
This idea is itself a bit of folklore.
It is a folk idea, a traditional notion that Mauritians have "about the nature of man, of the world, and of man’s life in the world,” as defined in an important article by Alan Dundes(1971 :95).
This idea that folklore is dying out is one of the commonest folk ideas everywhere.
People use it to express their sense of loss.
It is therefore a familiar point at which to start your collection of Mauritian folklore.
To enable you to see how much of this sense of loss you share with other Mauritians, here are some question you can ask yourself.
Later you can try asking them of other people in similar situations.
What differences do you see between your parents’ life and yours?
How would you contrast their life-experiences with yours?
What do you think your children’s life will be like?
What will they do, or see, or have that you don’t?
Will your children understand your parents?
In your own life,what are the major changes so far?
Why does it seem to you that your life has changed as much as it has?
What stories have you heard about people who have made big changes in their lives?
Questions about change.
Begin with yourself, then go on to ask others: Narratives.
What old stories do you remember from when you were a child or from when your parents were children?
Folk Speech.
What words, or groups of words, or sayings are used nowadays that were not used formerly?
Language of madam sere: how it works, when it is used, by whom, to whom, for what purposes (hiding from those who don’t understand it?).
What words or expressions or sayings did you hear in former times that you don’t hear any more?
What language(s) were used in former times that you do not hear any more?
Describe them.
Where did they come from?
Why did they disappear?
Do you ever find it hard to understand the way people around you speak?
Do you know any stories about difficulties of language (Creole—French, Hindi-English...)?
Mistake in language made by people who normally speak some other language.
Need to learn French or English to get work, or for some other purpose.
Use of French or English by a child whose parents speak only Creole or Bhojpuri.
Switching form Creole to Bhojpuri and back again: when is this done, by whom, to whom, for what purposes?
Do adults still say proverbs to children in the same way now as they did long ago?
Have the ways of speaking proverbs changed, as you recall?
What new proverbs have you heard or spoken?
Did people formerly remember more proverbs than they remember nowadays?
How have people‘s clothes changed since you were a child?
Do people work less or more?
Do people drink alcohol more or less than formerly?
What did people do for amusement when you were a child?
What do they do now?
Is it different?
Games people play.
Are there more lazy people nowadays?
Are there more of some other kind of people nowadays?
Give details.
Writing down your own and other people’s answers to these questions will tell you how much folklore you are carrying around with you.
Your knowledge of your own folklore will help when you are ready to question others.
In this kind of open-ended investigation, you will learn to base your questions on what a person has already said.
Open questions like "Really? Tell me more about that,” or “what would be an example of that?" will be your main contribution.
Do not change the subject or go on to another one of the written question until your informant is clearly finished with one topic.
From this series of questions, you will probably be able to get a sense of people‘s feeling about change in their life.
You will also identify talented storytellers and singers.
Then you can decide what your next step should be as a collector.
Mauritian cookery.
For instance, you might like to look at Mauritian cookery.
This is a realm where people like to participate in each other’s traditions.
Take the person who cooks in your family, supposing that it’s a woman.
Does she know something of the cookery practiced by other groups?
Is she as proficient in the cookery of another group as in the cookery of her own?
Or is what she calls "her own" cookery, a combination of other people’s cooking traditions?
Has she acquired some of the raw materials, methods of cooking, seasonings, or implements of other groups?
Are there certain occasions or time when he chooses to used these?
Or is the attachment of some dishes or seasonings to a certain group (like the French?) a reason to prefer them?
Cooking and eating are profoundly important to people’s sense of who they are and what group they belong to.
Folklore of experience.
People often express their sense of change in life by contrasting people in the present with the past.
Folklore thus take in local and national history.
The central way by which people remember history is to tell stories about it.
These are probably the easiest kind of story to collect,because people tell them as true.
Folklorists call them “personal experience stories" and "legends".
Personal experience narratives.
A personal experience story is one that happened to you, or to the person who is telling it to you - a first-person history.
In L’Express for 7 July 1980, for example, there appeared an interview with a man who dreamed a girl was telling him how to find buried treasure.
His account to the interviewer, Philippe Christian, is a personal experience history.
Other examples: memorable events which happened to you, humourous tales about yourself.
Experiences you had while traveling somewhere.
A legend is a third-person history.
The word legend is often used to mean an untrue history.
Whether people think they are true or not does not keep them from telling the stories.
Legends are a way of answering the questions about how thing have change in the past, because they are set in a period when the world was much as we see it today.
Legends also are part of the continuing fabric of people’s thinking about themselves.
A historical examples of the legend of the band of escaped slaves living at Morne Brabant.
When they were finally found, the story goes, they throw themselves into the sea rather than submit.
The legend shows the former slaves to have been proud, strong, defiant people.
Once a story like this is told among Mauritians again and again, it should be called a legend.
This one have been put into printed form, which has probably made it better known (Ramdoyal 1979: 1-7).
Every well-known historical person is the subject of stories,songs and sayings which are passed along orally.
These should be recorded.
Traditionally accounts of great historical persons.
The following names are only the beginning.
Famous persons of the period before independence.
Stories about Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Dr Maurice Cure, Guy Rosemont.
Examples: Sookdeo Bissondoyal had a rose in his house, which is used to consult every morning.
If it was open, his project(s) that day would succeed (`Flower"); if closed, they would not.
He had no telephone: he prefers to walk rather than own a car: if he went to the cinema, he sat only in the third class.
Pupils who went to him for tuition were told to pay whatever they could afford.
Think of other examples and other famous persons yourself.
Living persons are often the richest material for folklore.
especially those people who are not often seen, we only hear story.
Choose (or let your informants choose) your own examples from television or public life today.
Often the finest material for folklore is lound in a contemporary political situation.
Every village and community has its own local characters who have won fame or unusual qualities.
Accounts of the saying and doings of these local characters should be recorded.
Local heroes who did something memorable.
persons with unusual body forms: Very tall.
very short.
Very thin.
very fat.
Deformed persons who dressed in an unusual way.
person who had special powers (curing, foretelling the future, reciting holy writings).
person who lived to great old age.
Great singers, story tellers, dancers, athletes.
persons who made things (weapons, tools).
For all such persons, get answers to "How did this person become known?" and ‘“what was the story of his/her life?“.
Family Histories.
You can begin with your own family.
Who is the person of your family who is most talk about?
What stories have you heard about this person?
Which are the best known family names in your part of the island?
Which families have lived there longest?
Who are the well—known persons in the family’s past?
If you can find a family occasion that happens again and again during which stories about the family are told, it will make and excellent study for you.
Family gathering’s, especially at holiday time, are often the major opportunity people have to tell and hear bit’s of the family past.
Observe and record the following:
Names, roles and relationships of the people who are there.
The actions that happen one another.
The ways of speaking and acting that people use (speaking, shouting, whispering, laughing, singing, chanting, making or breaking eye contact).
The rules for performance.
Who is allowed to tell stories and who should listen?
How old does a person have to be to participate actively in this occasion?
Who are the storytellers?
who are the audience?
How do they assume their roles (for instance, does one person tell others to listen to the story teller?).
Other Themes to Ask For Unfaithful husbands and wives Children fathered by wrong person.
Childbirth assisted by magic.
Unusually lazy persons.
Person who eat a great deal.
Persons who are great talkers or singers or dancers.

Some of the history elements in the following list are numbered.
An unexpected person gets reward or fortune.
A man who people think will never do anything important does something to change their attitude.
Stories about a fool or stupid person.
People who is unusually kind or unkind.
Rewards for keeping on with a job or sticking to a task.

Prediction that a child or a man will become an important person.
Prophecy of the downfall of the British colonizers.
Legend of Pieter Both’s head.
Prophecies concerning the destiny of Mauritius, India, or another country.
Movements of people around Mauritius.
Present-day accounts of the past of Mauritius (oral histories)are valuable records of the way people see themselves, their group, and their life up to now.
Persons that traditionally tell stories about the past of Mauritius can usually be found, because they are well-known in their locality.
Sometimes people select a special person to keep and pass on the oral history of the place and people.
Or sometimes one person simply feels more interest in traditions or is a better storyteller.
When you find such and active bearer of tradition, give him or her special attention.
Oral stories should be recorded literally, along with the conditions under which they are usually told: persons listening, time of day, manner of telling the account.
Oral stories of the settlement of the a district and of the effects of important events upon the people deserve being recorded.
What do people say about the settling of their particular part of Mauritius?
Where did settlers come from?

Old Times in Mauritius.
What accounts have come down (through families?) of old times in Mauritius?
Old stories from former times.
Stories about place names.
What explanations do people give for place names in your neighborhood, or in some other part of Mauritius?
You will find that these are different from the "official" explanations.
For instance, some people say that Moka isnamed  for Mecca, the holy city of Islam, while others connect it to mocha coffee.
Some people think Rose Hill describes something once seen in that town, while others insist that it’s named after a place in a foreign country.
Record the place names exactly, especially if the name is no longer used officially, and especially if it occurs in variant forms.
Record place name legends exactly, no matter how fantastic they seem.
Like the story of Pieter Both‘s head.
How did the following places get their name?

Folklore Communication at a Fancy Fair.
The Fancy Fair in Mauritius is a fund raising event.
often sponsored by a church and held at a weekend.
It is a good example to remind you that everyday life is where you find most folklore.
At every Fancy Fair you find several of the same things over and over: games, a flea market of donated clothes, prepared food, predictable dishes like Briani, beer, and plenty of public drinking.
There are also many stories on fancy fair.
For instance, the Fancy Fair of St Anne of Chamarel, some people say, is famous for much public drunkenness.
It doesn’t matter whether that’s true or not.
It does matter what people say and think about it.
What can you find out about this and other Fancy Fairs?
Also, Fancy Fairs have undergone change over the last generation: song competitions, for instance, used to be part of every program, but now they don’t appear as much.
In 1989 a "chamber of horrors" turned up as part of the entertainment in one.
Thus, another topic is changes in this event over time.
Thanks to Vinesh Y.Hookoomsing for this suggestion.
Folk Speech and Song.
Many kinds of speech play, games and riddles exist in Mauritius, waiting to be systematically collected.
Playing with words, speech and language is one of the principal ways by which children learn.
In a multilingual society like this one, children also learn how to manage several languages.
Be alert for game and amusements in which children with from Creole to French or Bhojpuri to Creole, or use English words in Creole sentence.
Games with words, letters, numbers, or papers should be observed and recorded.
Also, bear in mind questions like these:
Are the games and songs of children in your community known and played only by children, or are they also part of the life of adults?
Do the games and songs of schoolchildren differ from the games and songs of children who are not in school?
If so, how?
Does the child learn some games and songs at a certain age and then go on to learn others as he gets older?
Does he forget the ones he learned before?
Do the games of young people change in any way according to different times of year?
Special games played on holidays or other special days.
Are games played by day or night?
Is there a leader?
Do some games separate one player from all the others?
The exchange of riddles among children is usually a game, involving the words they speak, the rules they follow for taking turns.
It is also interesting to observe the degree of power they grant to the person who puts the riddle, and the energy they put into it.
Observe the exchange of riddles by a group of children, either an exchange that occurs naturally or one which you suggest to them.
How do they do it?
How many are playing?
What are the roles of the participants (active, passive)?
Where do they sit or stand? Record the way the game is played, especially the questions and answers that make up the riddles themselves.
Games of initiation are related to riddling.
Observe and record any games in which children let other children in to their little society with formal works or actions.
Guessing games.
Notice the confusing devices used in riddles.
Some riddles say that an object has two opposed qualities.
“The mother says, ‘Go straight up’, the children say, ‘Let’s go crosswise’.
A ladder from Madagascar.
Other riddles deny themselves.
This corner is no corner at all.
A ring.
Still others reverse the usual relations of power between parent and children.
Riddling is usually a way of displaying or calling for knowledge.
To ask is to possess one kind of power; to answer is to possess another kind.
Therefore, observe and record:
Who displays knowledge?
Who calls for knowledge to be displayed?
When and where does this happen?
What purposes are these players showing?
Tongue-twisters are short sayings which are difficult to say, especially for someone just learning a language, and which must be said over and over very fast.
Collect examples of these.
What names are used locally for tongue-twisters?
Do children put them to each other?
How many of these does one child know?
How many times must a tongue-twister be said to show that the child can do it?
What happens if a child can’t say it?
Is there any "payment" or "punishment"?
Ask children for details.
Lullabies (songs that put children to sleep).
Games to amuse babies.
Counting-out rhymes.
Are these used to pick out one player for the playing of another game?
Action songs that must be acted out.
How do children divide themselves into groups for the playing of games or the singing of songs?
Do they form a ring, an arch, a line?
Games in which players do something different or opposite to what they are ordered to do.
What objects do children play with (hoops, wheels)?
Give a full description of each one, along with the way that children play with it.
Is the toy a small imitation of a familiar or known object (swords,shields)?
Don‘t assume that all toys are imported to Mauritius and bought from shops.
Who makes toys in your neighborhood?
What materials are used?
Games with balls, flowers, plants, buttons, sticks, ropes, strings,stones, bones, hoops, other objects.
Games with trees, birds, animals.
Games in which children play at being these things.
Games in which children play at being fathers, mothers, school-teachers, shopkeepers, or other adults.
Games in which players act certain parts.
Imitations of television programs.
Games in which children march around,or go from house to house.
Love games.
Hide and seek games.
Stories children like.
Hindu, Muslim, Chinese, European, and all other cultures that have contributed to Mauritius have always known the value of stories and proverbs in educating the young.
Teachers and parents are responsible for making sure that children do not forget their traditional folklore.
This includes both the riddles, games and amusements they learn from each other and the stories and proverbs in educating the young.
What more, if a teacher or a parent shows that she values a child’s real knowledge, she will suggest that children have something important that is theirs, and that the children themselves are important.
Who tells stories to children?
Does anyone try to get children away form television to listen to storytelling?
What times and places are suitable for storytelling?
Ask children to tell stories they know and discuss them.
Do children like the same stories you used to know as a child?
What do children like in the stories?
Here is something that secondary school children will enjoy.
Write the story that you like best.
It can be a story you have heard at home, or while playing with other children, or in school, or anywhere else.
Why do you like this story?
Who first told the story to you?
Was it first told in Creole, or some other language?
How old were you when you tirst heard the story?
Results of this assignment can be put together in a book as a creation of your school (Adapted from an experiment done in Ghana).
Proverbs are memorable sentences which are used to sum up and pass judgement on a situation.
Expressions shorter than a sentence, like “Ene bapteme lera, (a rat’s baptism)" are proverbial phrases.
Though it is the words which are memorable, and therefore which should be written down exactly, it is the situation in which the proverb is aid that should be observed most carefully.
For example, you might hear someone say, "the snail dances, the monkey laughs".
Without any information about when these words were said, by whom, to whom, we cannot know what this saying means.
You cannot assume that you already know.
You must find out from the person who says it.
Ask him or her to say the same idea in other words, and to explain the intention.
Proverbs are employed in Mauritius, as everywhere else, according to certain rules.
They are spoken only at certain times by certain persons (adults?) to certain other persons (children?).
Part of recording folklore consists in finding out the rules governing the usage of proverbs.
Notice also that proverbs are impersonal.
They allow the hearer to listen to the voice of experience, the nameless creators of the proverbs.
From their impersonality they gain their authority.
sheep’s business isn’t goat’s business.
Proverbs tend to vary less in their wording than other verbal forms.
A person will usually say the proverb the same way this time as last time.
But proverbs do vary in the meanings people attach to them.
It may refer in one person`s mind to noise and in another person’s mind to impoliteness.
All variant interpretations should be observed and recorded.
Who speaks?
What are the words exactly?
Who is supposed to listen?
How are the speaker and listener related?
Who is really listening?
What is the literal meaning of the proverb?
What is the meaning the hearer is supposed to get?
What was happening in the immediate conversation just then?
How do you interpret the proverb in this setting?
Folk Speech that identifies groups.
What words, groups of words, or sayings are used by people who are engaged in particular occupations?
Cutting sugar cane.
Working in textile factory.
Clerk or secretary in private sector.
Special Mobile Force.
Women’s folk speech, in these and their other occupations, should be observed and recorded.
For centuries, women in Mauritius have worked unbelievably hard to keep house, feed their families, and grow food.
Their traditions deserve study.
Also, the recent entry of thousands of women into the textile factories, airlines, hotels, and restaurants of Mauritius means the creation of new folk traditions — speech, custom, song.
Women’s traditions are often quite separate from men’s and should be given special attention.
What kinds of music or poetry belong to women?
Lullabies, death songs, wedding songs, songs making fun of people,songs at work.
Numbers as folk speech.
What numbers are used to stand for persons or objects?
Do people know these:
pretty girl, girlfriend.
leaving, going away.
urinating, peeing.
rear end, bottom, burn.
When and where do people use these expressions?
Are they used to superiors, to inferiors, only among good friends?
Listen for examples of how they are used in ordinary speech.
Listen also for the following names for pieces of money:
50 cents serf.
1 rupee lerwa.
5 rupees enn lame, enn tig.
50 rupees gros selen.
Folk speech usually invents many names for one thing that is of concern to people.
For instance, being drunk may be called roze, nisa (also used to mean high on drugs.
Listen for and record other examples of various words for the same thing.
Poetry and Song.
Poetry and song, in Bhojpuri, Creole, French, Chinese, or any language, are closely connected.
Some of the most appealing of all folk literature comes in the form of poetry or song.
Poetry is one of the most highly valued things people create.
Standards of what is beautiful vary, however, from group to group.
No poem or piece of sculpture or folksong is going to strike every person as beautiful.
What some people think is beautiful is just ugly to others, and no amount of telling them will make them believe otherwise.
It is only necessary that the people who keep a song or poem in memory should value it.
One service you can perform for your community is keeping these beautiful songs and poems in memory.
The collection of Bhojpuri songs made by Ms. Suchita Ramdin of the Mahatma Gandhi Institute shows what can be done with them.
If you are interested in folksong in Indian languages, consult this book.
Because folksong and music are arts of performance, you should take special care in recording them.
Microphones, tape recorders, and conditions of recording should all be of the best quality.
Much poetry in Mauritius is sung.
But you should also listen for any sort of poetry not connected with music: children’s rhymes, poems on the death of a local person.
Laments, dirges, funeral poems.
How are such poems performed?
Are they recited, chanted?
Do they get written down regularly, or are you the first person to write them in your community?
Are there special poems having to do with religious ritual, or connected with religion in any way?
These may be folk creations, or folk variations of sacred texts.
Observe and record these poems, and ask poets or singers to tell you about them.
How do they leam to make poems like this?
Do different religious groups have different songs associated with them?
Remember that while some religious songs are permitted to be sung only in a certain required form, others can be sung in variant forms.

Record the life history of a poet or singer who is specially well known and approved.
How does someone learn to make up or perform poems or songs?

What songs are sung only on certain occasions (weddings, funerals, births, initiations)?
How does a singer know to appear at such an occasion?
Is he or she invited?
What reward does he/she get, and who gives it to him/her?
Is that reward more or less than the reward people get for other kinds of work among that community?
Variation in folksong.
It sometimes happens that singers or poets will sing a song or say a poem twice.
You may decide to record the same piece again,because your first recording was not of good quality.
Or you may record it again in order to find out whether the performer always does the same thing.
Often, singers and poets tell you that the second time was just like the first, but you, the observer hear differences.
The singer or poet has put in changes without knowing it.
Notice this process if you can.
Variation can occur between different performances by the same poet or singer between artists between generations in a family and in many other ways.
How many and what kind of changes do people allow in their poetry and Song?
Some peoples want their songs and poems repeated just as they were heard long ago.
Others encourage new creation.
How important is sameness the people in your community?
Try to find written forms of poems and songs.
Copy these and compare them with the oral versions you record.

Is there a special sort of poem or song that praises or makes fun of a person?
Do people ever make up and sing poems or songs praising themselves?
Among the Islamic and Hindu communities, as among any Mauritian community, there may be folk poems about the religion.
Because Islamic people in Mauritius live far from Mecca and other centres of islamic culture, they have had to make special effort to strengthen their connection with the religion.
Look for short Lyric poems recited orally.

Folk Religion and Belief.
Religion is not folklore, but there is much folklore growing out of religion.
Anyone interested in people gives full respect to every person’s religion.
Anyone interested in folklore does the same.
Religious folklore does not violate anyone’s faith.
Usually, in fact,tradition deepens religious faith by increasing the devotion of believers.
Many people think immediately of religion when they hear the word folklore.
One reason is the importance of folklore in defining a group - Arya Samaj, Ismaili, Catholic, and so on.
Another reason is the prominence that is held by cultural festivals based in religion, like Cavadee, Ganga Snan, Maha Shivaratree, Chinese New Year and Eid—ul-Adha.
These are held out to tourists and visitors as colourful examples ofthe variety ofcultures in Mauritius.
According to some people, the beliefs and customs of religion in Mauritius, which have largely been brought here in former times, are now undergoing change or disappearance.
But disappearance of a custom or a belief does not mark it as folklore.
What marks a custom as folklore is that many people practice it in varying forms.
Religious folklore thus is often illogical, unsystematic, or inconsistent.
folklore meant something inherited from earlier times which is now threatened with disappearance, one could call Sanathan Hinduism or Chinese Buddhism folklore.
Obviously they are not.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity are world religions.
They are unified, coherent systems, explained and preached by priests.
In Mauritius, they are not disappearing, but they are changing, partly under the influence of the way they are actually practiced.
Folk religion means whatever beliefs and customs are now actually being practiced, by any group whatsoever, in varying forms, in Mauritius.
Observing and recording folk religion will increase everyone’s knowledge of life as people are living it today.
It will also increase people’s awareness of the depth and variety of human beliefs, as we are living it.
We must make a separation between “official" and “unofficial", or popular.
Some beliefs are "official": they are the prescribed forms and observances of their religion, as these are set forth by sacred writings and authorities.
Other beliefs and customs of folk religion are the "unofficial" variations, additions, and deletions which are being created in the actual practice of Mauritian people.
As a folklore collector, you should observe and record both the "official" and the unofficial.
When you know the difference, give special attention to "unofficial" actions and words.
Place these in the foreground, because these are folk religion.
Be sure to give an account of all variant forms of an action or a set of words.
Place authoritative prescriptions by priests or sculptures in the background.
Record what people think, what people say about what they think  and what they do to act on what they think.
A vital topic for folk religion is the dead.

Much belief and customary behaviour has to do with death and the dead, all of which needs recording, along with any stories.

Magic is doing something in order to produce an effect you want to produce; sometimes it is done by means of an object with special powers.
Some people are known to have special powers for good or harm or for curing.
People may be unwilling to tell you their beliefs in these matters, especially if you are not a local person yourself.

Religious festivals, which involve hundreds of persons in numerous different activities stretching over many clays, are the most complex and difficult of all topics to research in Mauritian folklore.
General accounts of many Mauritian religious festivals are already available, for instance the account by Burrun in Mauritius, its people, its cultures, by Sydney Selvon, Issa Asgarally, and Abhimanyu Unnuth.
The next steps in research will have to be a much more detailed and specific treatment of each festival as it actually is carried out in each place.
Clear and accurate recording of their innumerable details requires many repeated observations and interviews.
As suggested before, take careful note of people’s actual behavior, record exactly what they say, and be on the look-out for variant forms of belief custom, and statement.
A checklist of festivals to observe:
Ganga Asnan, Eid-ul-Adha, Chinese Spring Festival Ching Ming, Mid-Autumn or moon festival, Eid-ul—Fitr, Cavadee, Maha Shivaratree, Holi, Ganesh Chaturti, Divali, Easter, The Assumption.
Ancient Indian, Chinese, and other myths are stories about the beginning and nature of the world, about gods and other non human beings, and about the origins of the world of animals and plants.
Many such myths are kept alive by being told again and again.
Look for oral or "unofficial" versions or tales about origin of rain, Origin of day and night, Origin of death,Sun and moon rise and set in turn, tide caused by the breathing of a sea—monster, rain from a rain-spirit, Origin of war among human beings.
Folk medicine and curing.
Mauritian have developed many ways of understanding disease.
and many materials to treat it, such as herbal medicine.
They also consult clinics, dispensaries, hospitals, and doctors when they need to.
In a thorough study ofthe range of medical practices available in Mauritius, the anthropologist Linda Sussman found patients exercising considerable choice as to which treatment(s) they would utilize for vapours kinds of illness.
All of the village respondents held multicausal medical belief systems,” grouping illnesses into categories "of God”, “of dead souls,”, "of fright", "of saints”, “of man", or "of sorcery".
Up to seven distinct types of healers and eight different healing systems were available to her informants, who would regularly choose the healing system appropriate to each sort of illness.
To confirm this study ofmedical choices, all traditional knowledge and methods of healing should be recorded, along with the occasions when people choose one rather than another: What traditional healers are in your neighborhood?

How to Recognize and Collect Folktales.
Folktales do not take place in real time.
Folktales are considered as fiction.
Mauritian folktales were collected and printed by Charles Baissac in Le Folklore de l’Ile Maurice.
When you find storytellers oftoday telling versions ofthe tales Baissac printed a century ago, you will know that they were kept in memory through the end ofthe colonial period, into independence, right up to the time of industrialisation.
Many characters and incidents occur in the folktales of both East Africa and India and were probably brought to Mauritius from there.
You may collect stories about an animal trickster, for instance.
In the well-known story of the tarbaby and the rabbit.
An animal (hare, rabbit) has been stealing food.
He is punished when another animal, the tortoise captures him with tar.
Since this story is known all over Africa and throughout north and central India, we should expect to find it in Mauritius.
In fact it is very popular here.
It appears in Baissac's book and the storyteller Nelzir Ventre perfumed it on a MaBC television broadcast on 2 January 1983.
Or you might find another well-known tale in Mauritius, which concerns a girl of an age to be married who refuses all suitors.
She willfully marries a stranger who turns out to be a wolf or other monster.
Then she has to escape from this impossible marriage, sometimes with help from her brother.
These plots are favorites of Mauritian storytellers; there are many more.
Folktales exist in variant forms, forms which differ from one another.
For instance, in another story involving animals, a man learns secrets from the talk of animals.
He is told he will die if he lets anyone know what the animals said.
From this point, the story moves on in different forms.
Either the man tells his wife and hence dies, or, on advice from the ruler, he does not tell his wife.
Neither form is correct or incorrect.
Both variants are of equal importance to a knowledge of Mauritian folklore.
Variant forms like this should be carefully recorded.
Are Folktales only for children?
Many books containing one or more folktales are written for school children and others who are just learning to read.
The tales are rewritten into suitable language, information is added which no oral storyteller would need, and pictures illustrate scenes from the stories.
These books suggest indirectly that folktales are mainly suitable for children.
Indeed, Europeans have thought for many years that folktales were not interesting to adults.
The folk in India, Africa, and Mauritius do not agree.
Fishermen, housewives, tradesmen, and ordinary people continue to tell their old stories to adults, children, and anyone else who will listen.
Children are not the only audience for folktales.
Folktales have value for all people, as your collecting experience will quickly tell you.
The reader of a children’s book, however, is a different audience from a group of family members and friends listening to a village storyteller at night.
Adults find meanings in folktales which children don’t yet know.
The story about the girl who marries a wolf suggests to an adult that young women should take their parents’ advice about whom to marry.
To a child it`s an exciting story about a wild animal and a magical escape.
The wisdom of tales can be taken in by any person, without regard to age.
People around the world agree on this point.
Few people in India or Africa keep their folktales only for children.
Furthermore, no one should think that folktales represent the “childhood ofthe human race."
Folktales do not come to us from a more primitive stage of culture; they are not survivals of a crude past.
They are the most highly developed kind of oral art.
Folktales should be recorded in the exact words of the teller.
Does the performer use different tones of voice?
Does he/she imitate animal sounds, sing, chant, recite?
Audience behavior should
also be recorded; do people laugh, sing, clap?
To tell a story properly, should other people be performing along with the storyteller?
How do people show how they feel about the performance?
Be sure to observe and record all the persons who are in a storytelling event, and describe what they do there.
Find out from the storyteller or others what rules exist that determine performance.
Should stories be told only at night?
Are only certain persons allowed to perform stories?
What stories may not be told to women, men, children and outsiders?
Stories to ask for the best way to collect folktales is to be present at a time when they are being told — a family gathering, a village evening, or a celebration.
Then you can observe and record each story in order,notice who tells it to whom, how the audience responds and how one story seems to answer another.
Another way, which is less natural but which I have often used,and which may succeed for you, is to interview a storyteller.
You can ask whether the storyteller knows tales like those in Baissac’s.
You can summarize the stories from the books during your interview.
Or you can ask whether the storyteller knows tales about Tizan, or about the hare.
To help you jog the memory of storytellers you meet, you will find below a list of characters and incidents that might turn up.
These are called folktale “motifs".
A motif is not all of a story, but part of one: a trickster character like the hare is a motif and so is his action of tricking another character, as when hare tricked snail into acting as his riding-horse.
The motif has something memorable about it; a remarkably holy man, for instances a legend motif.
And it can be found in more than one story, like the man who is really a wolf.
You can use the list of motifs like this.
You ask, "Do you know any stories in which an animal gets a man out of a dangerous place?" or, "Do you know any story about how death came on Earth?".
The following motifs are common to the folklore of both East Africa and India and are likely to turn up in Mauritius.
Work your way through the list, asking yourself and local people, “Do you know any stories in which animals talk?," or “Do you know any stories in which a man goes through great difficulties to get a wife?"
Where one person gives an unclear answer, another person in the same community will have many stories to tell you.

The tale of the hare and the tortoise at the side of the king’s pond.
Long, long ago there lived in Mauritius a king who had a big pond.
Early each morning, the king went there to swim, because the doctor prescribed it.
One day, when he came to the edge of the pond, what did he find there?
The water was very dirty.
He could not possibly swim in it.
The king called his caretaker and swore at him.
The next day, the same thing happened.
The water was still dirty.
The third day again the same thing.
The king grabbed the caretaker by the neck and shook him hard.
He said, “Hey, you good for nothing, do you want me to get boils in that dirty water there?”.
If that pond is not clean tomorrow, you’ll see if I do not beat your behind.
The caretaker was frightened.
That evening he took his rifle, and went and hid himself in the elephant ear bushes at the edge of the pond.
The night was very, very black.
Even the moon was hiding.
When the bell rang to tell people that it was time to go to sleep, he heard the sound of footsteps.
He pricked up his ears.
Step, step, step.
It was a hare!
Before the caretaker had time to raise his rifle, the hare came right up to him and said:
“Hello there, Mister Caretaker! I am glad to see you!”.
I have been looking for you for a long time, because I have something good to give you.
Taste this honey my family sent me from Trois Ilots.
Now tell me if you have ever tasted such honey before.
The caretaker took the gourd, and tried a sip.
Hey! This is wonderful.
The caretaker kept tasting from the gourd, until it was empty.
Now, the hare had put a spell on that honey.
The caretaker only had time to lay himself down by the edge of the pond, then he was sound asleep and started to snore.
The hare gave a great laugh, took off his clothes and dived into the pond.
Now, the hare was mischievous.
When he had had enough, he got out of the pond, broke off a long stick, stirred up the mud, and made the water in the pond brown like chocolate, and then he left.
Early the next morning, the king came.
He only looked at the water.
A great anger took hold of him.
The caretaker was still asleep at the edge of the pond.
The king took the same stick the hare had used to stir up the muddy water and fell on the caretaker.
He beat him like an ox.
The caretaker ran into the woods and was never seen again.
The king had the trumpet sounded, “I need a caretaker who will watch my pond”.
Ten thousand rupees a month plus other benefits.
But if that caretaker lets someone muddy up the water in my pond, I will cut his throat.
When all the animals heard this, they were afraid.
No one applied.
Three days passed.
The hare continued to swim in the water.
The king no longer knew what to do.
His body was full of boils.
For seven days now he had not been able to bathe.
One day, the officers of the king came to him and said someone was asking about becoming the caretaker of the pond.
The king said, “Let him come in!”.
The king saw the candidate for the post of caretaker, and became angry.
The candidate was the tortoise.
You want to keep everyone from dirtying my pond?
Yes your Majesty, I can do it.
You know the condition?
If anyone muddies the water, I’ll cut your throat.
No problem, I know the condition and since tortoise meat is good to eat, you would be able to make a fine curry out of me.
But I do not think you will be tasting me this time.
You would better tell your cook to pluck a hen.
All right, chatterbox, tomorrow morning we will see.
Start work this evening.
The tortoise went away.
He went to his friend’s house, there he had him rub his shell all over with pitch.
When the sun set, he came to the edge of the pond, sat down in the path the hare would take, and waited.
Step, step, step, the hare came.
The hare saw something very black in the middle of the path, he stopped and looked around.
The tortoise’s head was hidden beneath his shell, nothing moved.
Step, step, step, the hare came quietly closer, but nothing moved.
The hare thought a little; he came closer, he looked closer, still nothing moved.
For quite some time, he stood there quietly.
The tortoise looked like a huge rock.
The hare’s heartbeat slowed, and he was not afraid any longer.
He said, “That is just a rock there! Now I know! Hey, everybody.
The king is such a good fellow.
Of course, he must have had his servant bring this bench down to the shore of the pond so I could sit here when I had to undress before swimming.
The hare laughed, then he sat down on the rock.
All of a sudden the rock moved a little.
The hare felt it slightly, but thought nothing of it.
That is just how they work here in Mauritius.
They forgot to stabilize my chair.
So he wanted to jump down in order to put a wedge under the rock that was his chair.
But his bottom was stuck to the pitch.
The tortoise stuck his head out from under his shell.
What do you think, old man?
Me, I think you’re stuck this time!
The hare was shocked.
But he had to try everything to save his life.
He said to the tortoise, “You are a fine one! Quit your joking! We are good neighbours".
Do not make me lose my temper.
The tortoise began to walk, taking the hare to the king’s house.
He said to the hare, “Keep talking if that makes you feel better”.
The hare raised his voice.
Are you being stubborn?
Now, what are you going to do?
Are you going to let me go or not?
The hare kicked him with his hind foot: the foot stuck!
Now the  other foot was stuck too.
The tortoise took no notice.
He only kept on walking along the path.
The hare said to him.
Now listen to me or I will use my front foot.
Watch out.
The tortoise kept on walking without a word.
A blow from the left foot.
A blow from the right foot.
Now all four feet were stuck!
But the poor unfortunate had to make another try.
He boasted to the tortoise, saying to him.
Listen to me now: I will say it one last time.
All my strength is in my head.
It is like a hammer.
If I hit you with my head, I will crush you like a ripe pawpaw.
Let me go, I tell you, let me go!
The tortoise kept on walking, he paid no attention at all.
The hare raised his head, collected all his strength, and hit.
Bang! The head stuck.
Finally, they came to the king’s house.
The tortoise was laughing, the hare was crying.
When the king saw the hare stuck on the tortoise’s shell, even though he was angry, he had to laugh too.
The tortoise said to him, “Here he is, Your Majesty! It would not be tortoise you will be eating tonight, but hare stew”.
The king took out his knife, cut off the hare’s head and sent it to the kitchen.
After that he called his servant.
Hey, you! Now I can go swimming in my pond.
Come rub my back.
The tale of the colophane trees.
Once upon a time, there lived a great king who lived in a big castle.
His garden was full of all sorts of trees.
He had lots of money, and he had lots of animals.
But one thing was wrong: his pond was completely dry.
There was not one drop of water in it.
One day, the king decided to find a solution for his water problem.
He called his horse and said to him, “Go to Grandmother Spider’s house, and ask her what I must do to make the water flow".
Give yourself the spurs and return as fast as you can.
The horse said, “Count on me, Your Majesty”.
And he started off like an arrow.
When he arrived at Grandmother Spider’s house, he said to her, “Hello, hello, Grandmother Spider”.
The king asks what he needs to do to make the water flow?
Grandmother Spider stood up on her legs.
She looked at the horse and said to him, “Tell the king he should cut down the colophane trees”.
Then the water will flow.
The horse galloped back.
But on the way his hoof hit the stump of a tamanicoque tree.
His hoof hurt so badly, he started to swear at the tree stump.
When he arrived back at the king’s house, His Majesty asked him what Grandmother Spider had said.
The horse could only think about that tamanicoque trees and said to the king, “Grandmother Spider said you should cut down the tamanicoque trees, then the water will flow.”
The king was happy.
He had every single tamanicoque on his estate cut down.
But not one drop of water flowed into his pond.
The king was furious.
He called for his horse and cut off his head.
Then he called for the cow.
The cow came, and the king sent her back to Grandmother Spider’s house.
Grandmother Spider told her again, “Cut down the colophane trees.”
Now, the cow was always happiest when eating.
She was always hungry.
Everywhere she went she was looking for grass to eat.
But there was no grass.
So she had to eat the tender leaves of the  blackwood tree.
And the leaves were bitter in her mouth.
When she came back to the king’s house, the king asked what Grandmother Spider had said to her.
But there were only bitter blackwood leaves in her mouth.
She said to the king, “Grandmother Spider said to cut down the blackwood trees”.
The king was happy.
He had all the blackwood trees cut down but the water refused to flow.
The king’s anger knew no bounds; he had the cow caught, and taken away to be cooked and eaten.
Then came Father Hare who boasted to the king, saying, “But Your Majesty, why are you giving such idiots such an important job?”.
I am the best man you can find.
All right then, do it, if you can.
The hare started off quickly.
He came to Grandmother Spider’s house and she told him, “Well, cut down those colophane trees, finally”.
On the hare’s way back to the king’s house, he met a hunter with his rifle.
The hare saw the rifle pointed at him.
It went off, he ran into a canefield and hid down under some straw for three days.
In the darkest night he left to go look for the king.
But even though he scratched his head, he couldn’t remember the name colophane, so he told the king, “Cut down the almond trees.”
The almond trees went down, but the water still wouldn’t flow.
The king cut off the hare’s head.
He sent him to the kitchen, one half to be roasted, the leftovers cooked with wine.
But the king was sad.
His pond was still dry.
The tortoise came up to the king, and asked him if he could go on the errand to Grandmother Spider’s house.
The king was still sad but he had to laugh.
And you, slowpoke, when will you return?
I will return when I return, Your Majesty, but when I do return you will have your answer.
So the king let him go.
The tortoise walked and walked, very slowly, but always straight ahead, never dawdling.
When he arrived at Grandmother Spider’s house, he asked her how the king could get water back in his pond.
But this time Grandmother Spider shouted at him angrily.
They keep bothering me with their stupid pond.
If there’s no water, put palmwine in it.
The tortoise spoke politely with Grandmother Spider and pleaded with her for her answer until finally she said, “Cut down the colophanes.”
The tortoise set out to return.
At least three months later, the king saw him coming from far off.
He said to the queen, “Do you like tortoise meat?”.
I think we’ll be eating tortoise meat for dinner.
The king called his cook in order to lose no time.
The cook came, the tortoise came.
The king asked the tortoise, “Well? Well?”.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Cut down the colophanes, Your Majesty; then the water will flow into your pond.
The king thought that this was just one more nasty liar.
He was angry and said to the tortoise, “I will have them cut down, but if no water flows into my pond, I will have a tortoise in my pot”.
So the king’s woodcutter cut down all the colophane trees.
And what do you think happened?
From all directions of the pond, water began to flow.
A miracle!
The pond was full!
The king was so happy that he said to his cook, “Kill the turkey, kill the goose, kill the guinea hen, kill the pigeon! I will give a great feast this evening to baptize our pond and it will be a great celebration”.
Everyone ate, everyone drank.
But don’t you believe that they were drinking pond water.
The king is not stupid.
Water is for bathing.
They drank wine and rum.
I asked for just a little glass, but they gave me such a kick and I landed here.
The tale of the hare, the elephant and the whale.
One day Father Hare took a little walk.
He came to the seashore.
He looked at the waves breaking on the shore and saw the whale swimming by.
The hare was shocked.
How huge it was.
That must be the king of all the animals.
He called to the whale.
Hey, sailor, come in a little closer here.
I have something to say to you.
The whale swam near the beach.
The hare said to him, “You really are huge but it is not size alone that makes strength”.
I am really pretty small, but it seems to me that I am stronger than you.
The whale looked at him and laughed.
The hare said to him, “Listen, I will go to fetch a strong rope”.
You tie one end to your tail.
I will tie the other end around my waist.
Then each of us pulls from his side.
I will bet I can pull you up onto dry land.
Go fetch that rope, my little one, and then we will see.
The hare left the whale.
He went into the woods.
There he met the elephant, and he said to him.
A huge head, but what a little tail.
People like you can’t be very strong.
As little as I am, if I fight with you, I will bet I can beat you.
The elephant looked at the hare, and laughed.
You tie one end around your waist.
Then each of us pulls from his side.
I will bet I can pull you like a fish on a line.
Go get your rope, friend, then we will see.
The hare went to fetch a strong rope.
He gave one end of it to the whale, and said to him.
Tie this tight.
When I shout ‘Ready, set, go!’ then pull.
We will both pull at the same time.
The whale tied the rope around his tail, and waited.
The hare took the other end of the rope to the elephant, and said to him, “Tie this tight”.
I will shout when I am ready, then each of us pulls from his side.
The elephant tied the rope around his waist, and waited.
The hare went and hid in some bushes.
Then he shouted, “I am ready, pull”.
The whale pulled from his side, the elephant pulled from the other side.
The rope stiffened like the strings of a violin.
They both did their best, but neither was able to pull the other away.
Pull, pull, pull! Snap.
All of a sudden the rope broke.
The elephant lost his balance and fell.
The whale landed in the coral and cut himself.
The hare came to the elephant, “Oh dear, my friend”.
May be you have hurt yourself.
I got you into this trouble for being stronger than you.
The elephant remained quiet, what could he say?
The hare came to the whale at the shoreline, saw that the water was all red with blood, and called to the whale.
Too bad you’ve got cut.
I am sorry that you’ve hurt yourself.
It is my fault for making you boast that you are as big as a ship.
Boasting is not good.
The whale stuttered.
What could he answer?
So that is why the elephant and the whale believe that the hare is stronger than they are.
The tale of little John and the oxtail.
Once upon a time there was a little boy whose name was Little John.
One day, when he went out to play, he caught a cricket.
He said to his papa, “Papa, Papa, look at the cricket I caught when I went out to play.”
His papa took the cricket from him and gave him an arrow instead.
Little John went away.
He found his mother, and said to her, “Mummy, Mummy, look at the arrow I got from Papa, when he took my cricket, the cricket I caught when I went out to play.”
So his mummy took the arrow, and gave him a coconut instead.
At the side of the river he found a woman who was trying to drink water with her hands, and he said to her, “Woman, woman, you must be silly to drink water with your hands! Here is a coconut”.
You can eat it and then use the shell to dip water.
The woman took the coconut, broke it and ate it.
Little John began to cry, saying to the woman, “Woman, woman, that is not what I meant!”
Give me back my coconut, the coconut I got from my mummy, when Mummy took my arrow, that I got from my papa, when Papa took my cricket, the cricket I caught when I went out to play.
The woman gave him a handful of lentils instead.
Little John went away.
He came to a wide road, where he found a pigeon that was trying to pick at the rocks laying about on the ground, and he said to it, “Pigeon, pigeon, you must be silly to try to eat the rocks laying about in the middle of the road”.
Here are some lentils, pick them up and eat them.
He scattered the lentils on the road in front of the pigeon, and the pigeon ate them.
Little John began to cry, saying to the pigeon, “Pigeon, pigeon, that’s not what I meant”.
!Give me back my lentils, the lentils that I got from the woman, when she took my coconut, the coconut that I got from my mummy, when she took my arrow, that I got from my papa, when he took my cricket, the cricket I caught when I went out to play.”
The pigeon gave him a feather.
He came to a school, and there he found a schoolboy who was trying to write on his paper with a little piece of wood.
He said to him, “Schoolboy, schoolboy, you must be silly”.
You are trying to write on your paper with a little piece of wood.
Here is a feather, sharpen it, and use it.
So the schoolboy took the feather, sharpened it, and used it instead.
Little John began to cry, saying, “Schoolboy, schoolboy, that’s not what I meant”.
Give me back my feather, the feather that I got from the pigeon who took my lentils, the lentils that I got from the woman, when she took my coconut, the coconut that I got from my mummy, when she took my arrow, that I got from my papa, when he took my cricket, the cricket I caught when I went out to play.
The schoolboy gave him an old notebook.
He came to a blacksmith’s shop, and found the blacksmith trying to light his fire with wet straw.
He said to him, “Blacksmith, blacksmith, you must be silly to try to light your fire with wet straw.
Here is some dry paper, take it and use it to light your fire.
The blacksmith took the paper, and lit his fire.
Little John began to cry, saying, “Blacksmith, blacksmith, that’s not what I meant”.
Give me back my paper, the paper I got from the schoolboy, the schoolboy who took my feather, the feather that I got from the pigeon who took my lentils, the lentils that I got from the woman, the woman who took my coconut, the coconut that I got from my mummy, when she took my arrow, that I got from my papa, when he took my cricket, the cricket I caught when I went out to play.
The blacksmith gave him an oxtail.
There he buried the oxtail in the sand, leaving a little bit of the oxtail above the ground.
Then he ran to the king’s house, and started to cry, saying to the king, “King, King, give me fifty men to help me pull my ox from the sand, there is only a little bit of his tail above the ground.”
The king gave him fifty men.
They all came to the seashore, they all pulled on the oxtail until it came out.
Little John returned to the king, and starting to cry again, he said to the king, “King, King, your band of men broke the tail off of my ox, my ox that is buried deep in the sand, and now I’ve lost my ox.
The king was in a generous mood.
He gave Little John a cow as a present.
And that day was the last time I ever saw a cricket in Mauritius turned into a cow.
The tale of old man lazybones.
Once upon a time, there was an old man they called Old Man Lazybones.
Now Old Man Lazybones had a cow.
And this cow was so thin, that one day it died.
Old Man Lazybones skinned the cow, then took the hide and hung it out to dry.
When the hide was finally dry, the old man took it, put it on his head, and went to sell it.
Old Man Lazybones went to all the houses, he went to all the shops; but noone wanted to buy his cowhide.
Old Man Lazybones walked and walked, until he came to a large forest.
His legs were so tired that he sat down to rest beneath a tree.
As he was resting there, he heard a noise – clipclop, clipclop; a band of forty thieves on their horses was coming.
Old Man Lazybones was afraid they would see him.
So he climbed up into the tree with his hide.
The thieves came up, dismounted from their horses, and sat down under the very tree Lazybones had climbed.
They pulled out all the money they had stolen, and put it into a pile to divide it among themselves.
When Old Man Lazybones saw how much money the thieves had there, he could hardly believe his eyes.
His hands began to shake and he let go of the cowhide.
The dried hide made a terrible crash and landed right in the middle of the band of thieves.
The thieves had no idea what was happening.
They left the money lying on the ground, jumped on their horses and fled.
Lazybones climbed down from his tree, gathered up all the money and carried it home.
Lazybones bought himself a grand carriage and two horses.
He went to the market, where he bought a crate of vegetables, for which he gave five piasters.
When the merchant tried to give him his change, he told him to keep the rest.
The king’s servant saw all this, and returning to his master’s house he said to the king, “I saw Old Man Lazybones at the market; he bought himself a whole crate of vegetables, and paid five piasters; but when the merchant tried to give him his change, he wouldn’t take it.”
The king was astonished, “Go fetch me Old Man Lazybones, and bring him here.”
When Lazybones arrived, the king asked him, “Where did you find all that money?” Lazybones told him, “I used to have a cow; but it died; so I skinned it and hung the hide out to dry.
When the skin was dry, I sold it”.
And that’s how I earned a nice sum of money.”
The king was jealous.
He thought, “But I have a huge herd of cows, if I slaughter them all and sell their hides, I will be able to earn much more money than Lazybones.”
So the king had all his cows slaughtered and skinned, he had the hides hung out to dry, had them all loaded onto a cart and sent off to be sold.
But noone wanted to buy them.
The cart drove and the cart drove some more, the hides began to stink, soon they stank so badly they had to be thrown away.
The king was furious, and went to Lazybones’ house.
When Lazybones saw the king coming from afar, he quickly put a soup pot over the fire.
When the pot was boiling hot, he took it from the fire and put it out in the middle of the road.
The pot kept boiling.
Lazybones took out his whip and beat the pot.
The king came, and he watched and wondered; he asked Lazybones, “What do you think you are doing, there?”
Lazybones replied, “Your Majesty, this is how I boil my soup.”
“This is the right way to boil soup?”
“Just like this, Your Majesty! Can’t you see for yourself that the water is boiling nicely in the pot?”
When the king returned to his house, he called for his cook, “Bring a pot and put all the things in it you need to make a soup.”
The cook came and did what the king ordered him to do.
“Now, put the pot out in the middle of the road, take a whip and beat the pot: the soup will start to boil.”
The cook beat the pot; but the pot wouldn’t boil.
“Whip it harder, there! Harder, harder still!”
The cook stood up straight, and whipped and beat the pot until it tipped over: all the soup ran out into the road.
He sent four policemen to arrest Lazybones.
The policemen caught Lazybones and put him in a gunny sack to bring him before the king.
That sack was so heavy!
When the policemen passed by a shop, they all decided to have a little something to drink.
They put the sack down by the side of the road, and went into the shop; each one took his turn paying for a round of drinks.
Old Man Lazybones sat in the sack and pricked up his ears.
He heard someone coming.
It was a shepherd with three hundred sheep.
When the shepherd came up to the sack, Lazybones began to cry inside, “O! God! What will I do?”.
Who can help me?
The king wants me to marry his daughter, so they have arrested me and put me in this sack.
But I am an old man, and the king’s daughter is so young and beautiful.
When water boils, that’s the time to put in the vegetables; my water has been cold for ages! Isn’t there anyone who can help me?
Anyone who would take my place?
The shepherd heard all this, and said to Lazybones, “Hey, Old Man, if you want, I will take your place.”
“Thank you, thank you, my friend! May God bless you! Open up the sack.”
So he opened up the sack, and Lazybones got out.
He put the shepherd in his place, tied up the sack, took the herd of sheep and left.
When the four policemen came out of the shop, they picked up the sack.
“Hey! I would almost say this sack has got lighter, wouldn’t you?”
It is the sugar-cane spirit that’s giving us strength.
When they came to the king’s house, the king said, “Tie a heavy rock to that sack and throw it into the pond.”
Two or three days later, Lazybones passed by the door of the king’s house with his three hundred sheep.
The king’s servant saw him, ran to the king and said, “King, King! That’s Old Man Lazybones passing by! Look at him with all those sheep!”
The king stopped Lazybones.
He asked him where he’d got all those sheep.
In the pond, Your Majesty!
Thank you so much for having me thrown in there.
When I have finished selling these three hundred sheep, I will just go and get some more there.
The king said, “Not a word more! I order that you put me in a sack and throw me into the pond!”
So they put the king in a sack and threw him into the pond.
The waters opened, they made huge ripples and the sack sank.
Lazybones stood at the side of the pond dancing a sega and singing:
“Sheep are not fish My king! Sheep are not fish.”
The tale of the bird that laid golden eggs.
Once upon a time there was a hunter who loved to go bird hunting.
One day he caught a bird with golden feathers in his net.
Early every morning the bird laid an egg.
The hunter sold the egg to the king’s cook.
When the cook broke the egg in order to fry it, he found a lump of gold inside.
The cook was a clever fellow.
He could hold his tongue, and said not a word to anyone.
I do not have to write all my thoughts on my forehead.
And so early every morning he kept the lump of gold for himself.
One day the queen needed some eggs to bake a cake.
She went into the kitchen.
But the cook was not there.
She took one of the eggs from the basket.
She broke it.
Of course, out rolled the lump of gold.
The queen bent down, picked up the lump, and examined it closely.
The cook came back into the kitchen.
And just where do you have this egg from, boy?
That is one of the eggs I bought from a woman called Old Lady Laouret, whose husband catches birds.
The queen said not a word, and left the kitchen.
Now, the queen had a son.
One day when the boy was out taking a walk, he passed by Old Lady Laouret’s house, and he went in.
There he found a bird, and he took a closer look.
This bird was more beautiful than any other bird.
Hey, Old Lady; sell me your bird.
Not that one, sir!
That bird over there is for sale.
The king’s son played for a while with the bird, turning it over and over.
All of a sudden it raised its wing.
Something was written beneath the wing.
The boy read, “Whoever eats my head will receive a sack of money every morning; whoever eats my heart will receive a sack of gold every evening.”
The boy said not a word, he left the bird, and returned to his mother’s house, and told her all he had seen.
Together they planned what to do.
Old Lady Laouret had a young daughter.
The queen said to her son, “Do you know what we need to do? You must marry Old Lady Laouret’s daughter, that way we will get her bird.”
The queen’s son ran to Laouret’s house, and said to her, “Old Lady, I love your daughter, and want to marry her, give her to me; what do you say?”
Now! Now! Don’t be funny! You are the king’s son, my daughter is just a poor little girl.
How could I believe that your mother would be satisfied with such a daughter-in-law who wears gunny-sack dresses?
But it was my mother herself who sent me here to ask to marry your daughter.
The old lady laughed and shook her head, “Oh sir! You’re just joking with me!”
The king’s son went back to his mother’s house, and told her that Old Lady Laouret thought he was just talking nonsense; they would have to go there together.
So the queen took up her shawl, put on her hat and her best shoes, and together they went to Laouret’s house.
When the queen asked the woman for her daughter’s hand in marriage for her son, the woman was very happy and praised God.
Then the king’s son said.
But there is one condition.
On the day we marry, you will kill the bird with the golden feathers, and you will put aside its heart and head for me to eat.
The day of the wedding came.
The king’s son gave the bird to the cook, and said, “Cook the heart and head and put them aside for me, but do not use any curry”.
I do not like that.
Now, I must tell you that old Laouret also had two sons.
And these two sons could both read since they had been to the government school.
They had also read what was written beneath the bird’s wing.
They were keeping watch from the corner of the kitchen.
When the cook left, they went inside and stole the bird’s heart and head from the pot and ran away.
When the cook brought the bird to the table, there was no heart, there was no head.
The king’s son, let me tell you, fell into a terrible rage.
He looked everywhere for Old Lady Laouret’s sons to kill them.
But her two sons fled, and it was their bad luck that they ran into the wolf’s house to hide.
The wolf grabbed them and ate them both up.
The tale of the stupid boy.
Once upon a time there was a woman who had a son, but the poor boy was very stupid. One day, his mother sent him to the market to buy an axe.
On the way home, he played with the axe.
He slashed here, he cut there.
When he finally came home, his mother’s little lamb was eating grass in the yard.
He cried, “Mama, Mama, see what a wonderful axe I bought for you!”
And he cut off the lamb’s head in one blow.
His mother became very angry, she shouted at him and asked him why he had not put the axe in a cart with straw.
Then nothing would have happened.
Then the little idiot began to cry and cry and asked his mother’s pardon.
The next day, the woman sent him to buy some needles, and she said to him, “Now remember what happened with the axe, and do not lose those needles!”
Off he went and soon he returned.
The woman asked him, “All right! Where are my needles?”
“Don’t worry, Mama, I paid attention to what you said”.
On the way back home I met Mister John with his cart, and I hid the needles in the straw.
The woman was so disgusted with him.
Why didn’t you pin the needles to your hat.
There’s my money lost again.
The next day his mother sent him off again to buy some butter, and she said to him, “Now remember what happened with the needles, and don’t lose that butter.”
Off he went, bought the butter, and pinned it to his hat.
The sun was so hot that the butter melted.
It ran down his face and onto his clothes, so that when he got home he was as dirty as a little pig.
His mother raised her hands in the air, “What was God thinking, to put such an idiot on this earth!”
A month later, his mother gave him two chickens to sell.
Since he could not buy things properly, may be he could sell something: “But you should not sell the chickens at the first price you are offered, wait for the second offer.”
“All right, Mama, I will wait for the second price, do you think I am that stupid?”
Off he went.
He met a cook, and the cook asked him how much the chickens cost.
“Set the price yourself.”
The cook took the chickens and looked them over, “Seven rupees and ten cents, if you like.”
“That’s your first price, what is your second one?”
Now, the cook decided to have some fun with him.
So he told him six rupees and five cents.
I will take your six rupees and five cents.
I always take the second price when I am selling something.
He returned home, and told his mother what had happened.
The woman was furious and wanted to beat him, so he had to run and hide.
Another time the woman gave him a sheep to sell.
But don’t do the same thing with my sheep as you did with my chickens.
Listen to what I say.
People will offer you a price, let them raise that price until they can not raise it any more.
Then you can sell them the sheep.
You heard me now, don’t forget what I have told you.
And off he went.
Along the way, he met a butcher.
The butcher offered him eight rupees.
Not high enough, you will have to go higher.
The butcher’s son knew about the poor idiot, and tugged at his father’s sleeve, and said.
Papa, leave this to me, I can handle him.
There was a ladder leaning up against the wall.
The butcher’s son climbed up on it.
At the first step of the ladder, he said, “Seven rupees”.
Climbing up a step, he said, “Six rupees”.
Climbing up another step, he said, “Five rupees”.
And when he got to the top, with no more steps left, he said, “Two rupees, you can see that I can’t go any higher!”
All right!
If you can not go any higher, what else can we do?
Take the sheep, and give me the two rupees.
He went back home, gave his mother the two rupees, and told her what had happened.
The poor woman picked up a broom and gave him a beating.
The poor idiot got such a blow on the head and he went mad.
And that was the last time I ever saw him at the market.
The historic bourgeoisie was too strong economically and politically, as well as in the media, so it won.
When, before that, the Leal, Kalachand or Ganee Moossa family businesses benefited from State support and became little empires, it was not their community that counted but the fact that Labour, through bourgeois democracy, was helping smaller capitalists by giving them “chances” to challenge the historic bourgeoisie.
Just as right now the State is helping the Maurel’s, Gowreesoo’s and Rawat’s to get more of the blanket on their side of the bed, at a time when the sugar estates are set to rake in fortunes on their exports and from their Integrated Resort Scheme real estate deals, and when the New Mauritius Hotels is declaring over a billion rupees in profits for the past six months.
We should not befuddle our understanding of present-day history, driven as it is by economic and class forces, by handicapping ourselves through wearing, like race-horses, “race blinkers”.
Government threatens historic bourgeoisie.
Anyway, the historic bourgeoisie is still stuck to its sugar-cane and mills, while desperately trying to cut losses by centralizing into four “clusters”, diversifying within sugar (mainly into electricity and ethanol) and delocalizing to places like Mozambique, Côte Ivoire, Tanzania and Benin.
It is getting the lion’s share of the billions of money called “accompanying measures” from the European Union as compensation for the end of protectionism.
Now, Government, in its attack on the historic bourgeoisie, is saying:  Hold on! Hand over 2,000 arpents of land first!
Don’t expect a price increase for sugar sold locally!
Foot more of the bill for the laying off of workers!
Pay the 40-hour week to workers!
The historic bourgeoisie cries, in reply: “New conditions? Down with new conditions!”
The historic bourgeoisie also still controls a good deal of the import trade, much of it on a monopoly basis.
The Government threatens it with the Competition Bill: “No more controlling imports and retailing! No more one company holding too big a share of the market! No more stocking only one brand-mark!”
Rogers, Blyth and other huge companies cringe.
The historic bourgeoisie has also still stuck to the textiles that it has invested in over the past 30 or 40 years, though the sector has gone hi-tech, delocalized to Madagascar, Bangladesh and India, and brought in contract workers from abroad to live in hostels and work work work, undercutting Mauritian labour practices.
The historic bourgeoisie has also invested in tourism and finance.
And it has, since converting agricultural land into rich men’s ghettoes, made windfall gains in real estate.
This is, as Ram Seegobin points out, a direct result of changes in Government Regulations designed to give them such windfall gains.
And yet the historic bourgeoisie expects support of the State to go on and on.
A real estate bubble is also threatening to burst on them, as even the new Governor of the Bank of Mauritius is predicting.
Because of sugar and textiles being historically so intertwined into the rest of the economy, their collapse has systemic implications.
Western vs. Eastern Capital?
The historic bourgeoisie is often allied with French and/or South African capital.
This external support dates back to the period of pre-1810 French colonization, and to the Apartheid era, respectively.
When the sugar estates have partners from the French bourgeoisie for their electricity production plans, for example, then Europe’s “accompanying money” to the Mauritian Government becomes like the payment of European money to its own “Fifth Column”, the French bourgeoisie through its joint ventures with the Mauritian historic bourgeoisie.
This is probably one of the insinuations Prime Minister Ramgoolam intends when he reminds the private sector spokesmen, Mr. De Navacelle, that Mauritius “isn’t a colony any more”.
The historic bourgeoisie expects to continue getting the same State support is has had throughout modern history when it has been in an alliance, even though often conflictual, with the politically strong small planters, which has ensured a fairly stable ruling block.
Meanwhile, the State-supported bourgeoisie continues to build smaller empires up into bigger ones with help from direct and indirect State intervention, as it has done, particularly from Labour Party Governments since even before Independence.
See how it works:  The Labour Government, in opposing the sugar oligarchs, supports the Maurel Alcodis plant which happens to be in the back-yard of the nationalized sugar estate Rose Belle;
when the plant needs the same molasses the sugar estates wanted for their own energy production, Government removes the ethanol component from the clusters being set up by the Sugar Industry Efficiency Act.
The Labour Government supports both the local Gowreesoo’s Samlo iron-and-steel plant and also the Murray-Roberts (South African construction firm that is in alliance with the Indian giant Mittal) as together, they wrest control over what was mainly a Rogers’ Desbro sector, again attacking the historic bourgeoisie.
Labour supports the Rawat empire v/s the historic bourgeoisie in the fields of telecommunications, investment companies, private hospitals, retail trade, to name just some of the fields.
The Labour Government brings in the massive Tian Li project from China, with its 17 billion-rupee investment.
It allies CEB with a Malaysian company.
It encourages Indian investment in the Land Based Oceanic Industry and in the petroleum products trade, creating space for Indian Oil to compete with the previous oligopoly.
Even the press empires that have, over the years, in all crucial conflicts supported the historic bourgeoisie, often in the most embarrassingly abject ways, are now challenged by a press group that is close to the State-supported bourgeoisie.
We note that the Labour Government has, like the MSM before it, favoured the “Eastern option” for its preferred source of foreign investment and for its challenges against the historic bourgeoisie, which continues to rely on French and South African capital, as it beats off the challenge.
Attacks on working people.
And as the two sections of the bourgeoisie go into conflict, the Prime Minister attacks the historic bourgeoisie and at the same time attacks the Unions.
This makes it look, at least for the moment, as if it is heading for a Bonapartist form of government.
In the past Labour relied on some conscious working class support, but right now it attacks the working class and its Unions, which are reeling under the attack.
In the past, the Labour Party in 1953, Labour has always, in the last analysis, protected the State bourgeoisie and those specific capitalists in the historic bourgeoisie who “co-operate” in its political plan to broaden the social base of the bourgeoisie.
Government has in 2007 set up the “tripartite” National Pay Council mentioned earlier.
It is charged with settling annual wage compensation bureaucratically instead of politically as has been the case since 1972, and, significantly, taking into account from now onwards “productivity” and “capacity for the employer to pay”, as well as the rise in the Cost Price Index.
The unions rightly boycotted this “tripartite” Council, and the Government has nominated five individual trade unionists of its own choice.
As the union movement is in this important battle against Government, another battle looms on the horizon: the replacement of existing industrial relations legislation.
Many of the unions are still probably in the pro-capitalist arms of the MMM, MSM and UN from the days of the recent “Platform National”.
MTUC will potentially split in two since Yousouf Sooklall’s nomination to the NPC and his suspension from the MTUC.
GWF and FPU have been split into some five or six federations, in the midst of vitriolic fights amongst bureaucrats and trade union “controllers”, who are also often bureaucrats of the worst ilk.
Clearly, the systemic crisis has hit the trade union movement, itself.
In addition to the working class proper being under attack, small planters and fishermen, small traders and small entrepreneurs are also under attack, both by the implacable logic of capitalism itself and as a result of specific options the Government has taken.
Sporadic demonstrations, some of them very creative like blocking pleasure crafts with small pirogues out at sea, take place all over, but end, so far, with offers of money compensation, in exchange for things that have more than money value, like the land and the sea and the right to work.
Social crisis.
And the disorder has spread.
Robberies and hold-ups get more audacious. Crimes more horrific.
Reported cases of rape and incest rise so high that one realizes it cannot be only the reporting that is increasing.
The Government replies by threatening more and more repression.
Sentences of 60 years are now being introduced.
This will, in turn, make the prisons even less manageable than they already.
The repression used against drugs has only served to aggravate the problem.
Now prostitution, especially around drug-takers, but also around tourism, has spread into new area after new area.
The overlapping of drug abuse with the sex trade makes the control of the HIV-Aids spread very difficult.
Mini-riots tend to break out in neighbourhoods, here and there, with people burning tyres in the roads, as they express the distress of a fatal road accident or a lack of a water supply.
The politics of creating a new society.
And from all this disorder, human beings have to forge something new.
It is not easy.
But that is the task before us.
Moving from where we are today, to where we can be tomorrow.
That is the collective task before us.
These three essays are one of Lalit’s contributions.
Because part of any program for change is understanding.
This understanding must be shared.
This shared understanding must be conscious.
That is what makes our conscious actions perkitan in our history that now lies before us.
Sithanen’s 2006 Budget.
Does it address the real problems?
Can it do anything to solve them?
This paper doesn’t aim to give any sort of global analysis of the content of the budget.
That work has already been done in our initial reaction to the budget, the night of the budget speech.
Our comments have also been published in the press, Lalit members have been on radio programs, and we have circulated documents, too.
So we have already commented on the budget, as a whole.
Today itself (Sunday 25th June 2006), in the Week-End newspaper, there is an interview of Lindsey Collen in which she talks about the budget globally.
What I intend to do, instead, is to analyze the budget to see how far Finance Minister Rama Sithanen’s proposals address the present economic and social crisis, and compare his supposed solutions with Lalit’s own proposals.
So, we will compare this budget with our program. We launched a political program for an alternative economy quite a while ago, even before the General Elections.
And in our electoral campaign, it was the political program for an alternative economy, which was really the pillar of our electoral campaign, whether on radio, on television or in our indoor meetings, or public outdoor meetings we held.
Sithanen acknowledges the crisis.
Sithanen in his budget acknowledges the seriousness of the crisis, especially in terms of employment and unemployment.
But when he comes to making proposals for possible solutions, these are diametrically opposed to Lalit’s.
I would like to underline that when we proposed an alternative political economy during the course of the election campaign, we made it clear that both the Social Alliance and the MSM-MMM Alliance, whichever would form the next government after the elections, would go ahead and implement ultra-liberal policies – no matter what they said in the campaign.
That is, we predicted that either Alliance, when it came to power, would impose a “solution” to this economic crisis that would shift the entire burden of this crisis on to the backs of the poor and the working class, who are in no way to blame for the crisis.
In fact, the bourgeoisie and past governments, by refusing to anticipate what would quite obviously happen in the textile and sugar industries and what is now, in fact, happening, are responsible for this crisis.
And they did not predict that the two crises would happen at the same time, either.
This double crisis is something that has been lurking around for the past 20 years, and everybody knew it was coming.
But neither the bosses nor the political parties that successively came to power anticipated the problem as it could have and should have been anticipated.
In our electoral campaign we also warned against austerity measures, and the way they would be imposed by the State through repression.
These were the very words we used in our party political broadcasts on TV and radio during the electoral campaign.
It is quite funny really to hear the MMM and its leader Bérenger denouncing this budget as “ultra-liberal”.
Bérenger, himself is an ultra-liberal.
Everybody knows that.
May be he means Sithanen’s budget is not just ultra-liberal but ultra-ultra-liberal [Laughter], which is true.
This is of course the type of demagogy we expect from a parliamentary opposition like the MMM.
Today whatever the MMM says, it can say the exact opposite at the same time, without batting an eyelid.
The first thing I’ll do is to analyze what the Social Alliance Government’s budget proposes to do in the context of this economic and social crisis.
We will judge this by looking at specific measures in the budget.
Then we can look at how we intend to continue our campaign after the budget.
We have already heard the Budget Speech in the National Assembly. It has been examined in the “Committee Stage”. It’s been voted.
So, the budget is now a fact.
So, we will be looking at how, we, in Lalit, given that there’s this new budget with its own specific measures, will need to adapt our ongoing campaign.
This will also be an important aspect of today’s theoretical seminar.
So we will look at specific measures in the budget, and at how we will modify our campaign given these new measures being brought in for the next year to come, and perhaps having effects for many years after that, too.
Title of the Budget Speech.
The title of the Budget Speech is “Securing the transition: From trade preferences to global competition”.
That is to say, how to ensure a transition from an economy based on preferential markets, especially for sugar and textiles, to an economy based on global competition.
That is to say, the sugar and textile industries can no longer rely on protected markets.
Now they will have to compete on the global market and Mauritius will have to be “competitive”.
The Budget Title gives away a great deal on the nature on the budgetary measures.
The end of preferential trade.
The title of the Budget Speech refers to two things: “trade preferences” and “global competition”.
But “preferential trade” is an abstract concept.
Whereas preferential markets for the Textiles and Sugar, refers directly to two big very, very tangible sectors of production.
It means loads of different real textile factories; it means 80% of our agricultural land, and 11 sugar mills.
So you can’t just hide behind the abstract words like “trade preferences”.
These are the two biggest sectors of the economy. The textile industry employs 40,000 - 50,000 people, even though the numbers have decreased drastically.
In the Sugar Industry there are still a lot of jobs, though there too jobs have decreased.
So when we talk of “Trade Preferences”, we are talking of two big sectors of production, which employ more than 100,000 people, directly and indirectly.
Then when Government says that we are making the transition between this, “trade preferences” (which we now see means two huge sectors) and “global competition”, when they talk of “global competition”, they are not talking about production at all.
They are not saying what kind of factories they are talking about.
They don’t say what will be cultivated.
What will be produced?
They don’t say.
They just talk of producing any old thing, they don’t say what, so long as it’s done cheaply.
So the title of the budget itself gives away the political fraud that the budget is: two specific huge sectors of production that employ thousands and thousands of people are collapsing, and instead we are heading for another economic reality where there is no hint as to what will, in fact, be produced.
They don’t even bother to tell us whether there will be jobs created in this new “global competition” economy.
So the title exposes very clearly what’s in Sithanen’s head, and what’s in the mind of the Social Alliance regime.
But the end of the preferential market is something that has been predictable for ages, and especially since the creation of the World Trade Organisation in 1994-1995.
It was evident where everything was heading.
May be the time schedule was difficult to foresee, but it was certain that it was coming.
What is being experienced today both in the textile and the sugar industry can be seen as an outcome of the logic inherent in capitalist globalisation.
It follows like day follows night.
And when we analyse the logic inherent in capitalist globalisation in regard to what is happening now, we can see that this economic crisis is part of the very logic of the system.
The consequences of Capitalist Globalization.
This budget for the first time reveals the consequences of capitalist globalisation to the people of Mauritius.
In other parts of the world, the consequences have already been felt for the past three, four, five, six years.
In such places as India, Latin America and Africa, they have started to witness its direct effects.
When I say “direct effects”, I mean the effects on the daily lives of people.
In many countries these effects have already been felt.
This is why, in India for example, where there is a huge peasantry, millions of small planters (to give an idea of the scale, one small farmers’ association has 10,000,000 members), once GMO seeds under the control of multinational corporations were introduced, many planters were completely ruined, and as we have learnt, thousands of farmers have been reduced to selling one of their kidneys just so that they can buy seeds to plant for their next harvest.
This is due to the fact that the WTO is mainly responsible for the bankrupting of small planters, not only in India but also in Latin America. In France, small planters, in their association uniting peasants, together with José Bové, have for years already been reacting to the consequences of globalisation as they have felt them.
But in Mauritius, to some extent, the preferential market for sugar and textiles is precisely what has protected the masses of the people. However, the globalisation logic means that for one, two or three years there can be some protection, but not after that.
Now, in fact, this budget comes and reveals clearly to everyone the consequences for the people when there will no longer be any protection.
This is what the budget is in fact doing.
As I have said, perhaps for the first time the people will really be hit by globalisation when, for example, they go to buy bread in the morning, when they send their children off to school each week-day, when they are looking for a job for their 16-17 years old children. Wherever we turn, we will be forced to understand what a crisis is.
It will be felt in the marrow of our bones what this capitalist globalisation logic is.
But in other parts of the world there have been mass movements, and the big international conferences in Mexico, in Mumbai in India, in Porto Alegre in Brazil, attended by 80,000 to 100,000 people, from all sorts of different organisations, have for years now been discussing the effects of capitalist globalisation.
It was precisely these issues that were discussed two to three years ago, in Mumbai.
It is this movement, which is known as the alter-globalisation movement, that has for a number of years now been explaining exactly what is happening to the people in Mauritius today.
How Sithanen will deal with disappearing preferential markets.
In order to cope with the disappearing preferential markets, what does the Sithanen Budget propose? How does he intend to re-launch the economy? Even in his own terms, how does he intend to attract investments? How does he intend to improve growth rates? And, more importantly, how does he intend to create jobs?
It’s obvious that the crisis of the sugar and textile industries presents itself, in the main, as a crisis of unemployment.
These are two big work sectors.
Both industries have already had drastic decreases in their employment over the past five years or even more.
But, now catastrophic decreases may suddenly be upon us.
These are two huge sectors where no new employment will be created, and where on the contrary there will be a reduction in employment.
Just to show how this is “the chronicle of a pre-announced crisis”, you will all remember how Ministers like Sushil Kushiram, Berenger, Pravind Jugnauth, ex-Finance Ministers of the previous MSM-MMM regime, were already talking first about “jobless growth” and then afterwards saying maybe they had been wrong and that it was more accurate to refer to “job-loss growth”.
So this has been a leitmotif of all the different political parties in power.
The logic marches on and does not flinch, no matter who wins the election in Rose-Belle and Plaine Magnien! [Laughter]
Let’s see what Sithanen is proposing by way of attracting investment, re-establishing growth rates and creating jobs.
(a) Lower real wage rates.
The main thrust of the Budget, from the point of view of working people and poor people, is that Sithanen proposes to decrease real wages, and worsen work conditions.
When you read the Budget Speech, this is, from our standpoint, the central issue. Sithanen wants to attract investment, increase the growth rate and create employment by means, first and foremost, of reducing the cost of production, and he intends doing this by reducing real wages.
I’ll come back to how he intends doing this, later.
(b) Privatization.
When you close down the Development Works Corporation (DWC) which was set up to create jobs, and you are encouraging DWC workers to set up private companies so that they can then buy the DWC’s rotten old equipment so that they can run private businesses, this is a form of privatization of the construction sector.
There is also the privatization of the National Transport Authority (NTA) and the car “fitness certification” soon to be done by private firms.
The garage for repairing the Government fleet is being closed down. Government work is being out-sourced, privatized, and given to the private sector.
At first I was very worried about closing the SMF Garage because I wondered what we could then do with people like Assistant Superintendent Raddhoa! [Laughter] Where could he then be transferred to, to keep him out of contact with the public so as to curb him and his brutal team of investigators?
However, privatization in the budget also involves, at the same time, opening up the economy to international capital by means of taking all sorts of measures to make Mauritius look more attractive, more inviting, more seductive, to foreign investors.
Not just investors, but also speculators, mafias, and fly-by-night businesses out to make a quick buck, then move on to where it is once again more profitable elsewhere.
And this privatization involves dismantling the provisions of the Welfare State.
That, too, is a form of privatization. Here, as anywhere else in the world, children have to go to school, people have to look after themselves when they are ill, have to organize how to live in their old age.
The Welfare State starting point is that the State offers free education, free health care, and universal pensions for everyone.
But when you start “targeting”, making people pay, this too is a form of privatization, in that people will have to move into private institutions because the State is no longer providing the service as a right.
For health, for university education and for pensions, the State is intending to phase out the services as a right.
Now, this kind of privatization has as one of its additional aims, that it attracts foreign investors.
In education, for example, especially since the WTO and its commerce in services “GATS” (General Agreement on Trade in Services), the State has committed itself to opening up tertiary education to international investments.
So now you have all sorts of universities from Australia and South Africa opening up here.
Tertiary education is being privatized.
Secondary and primary school may follow.
Already there are more and more investments in these kinds of private institutions, which means, in fact, privatizing services that were a right under the Welfare State.
(c) Creative Accounting.
The budget is also an example of accountancy tricks.
We know Sithanen used to work as an accountant for the Rogers Company that was not so long ago involved in the big scandal with Air Mauritius, and we know that that type of company knows about accountancy tricks.
This budget certainly contains one big bit of “creative accounting”, as they call it these days.
Sithanen makes proposals for measures that will directly lead to land speculation.
There are a number of measures which seem fair enough, like the decrease in Registration Duty when you buy a piece of land, but in Mauritius, there aren’t many poor people buying and selling land.
So the measure turns out to facilitate real estate speculation and land transactions.
Another measure encourages Integrated Resorts Scheme (IRS) projects and extends the scope of the previous IRS.
In the same way that the former Government invented this concept of IRS as rich ghettos, special touristy places where very rich people will buy bungalows for Rs 15 millions with a golf course, marinas with boats on beaches for their personal use.
This was the old IRS concept on the MMM-MSM model.
This new government is now extending the scope of the IRS.
There will now be IRS projects for different income groups and they will offer different forms of residences.
This will also promote real estate speculation, land transactions and a lot of shady deals.
Perhaps many of you will have read in the newspapers yesterday and even today that the Médine Sugar Estate Company, immediately after the presentation of the budget came up with a spectacular plan for the whole of the West of Mauritius. It will build new housing estates, roads, and residential projects. Even a golf course. A private sugar company will come and re-design one-quarter of the landscape of Mauritius.
It is not a coincidence that the Médine Sugar Estate Company one week after the budget speech comes up with this project.
This project, if you look at it closely, will transform Médine from being a sugar company (it’ll keep it’s cane, of course) into a real estate Company. Now it will make its profits through land transactions and through land conversion.
We should not lose sight of the fact that through the IRS projects, the Sugar Industry is being given the chance to convert its agricultural land into residential property.
When agricultural land is converted to residential property, its value goes up by 10-15 times.
In the Same Place.
The Government just signs a bit of paper, and the value of the land soars.
Only a piece of paper!
It is this kind of financial speculation, which Sithanen is encouraging through a series of budgetary measures.
Why is it that I call this accountancy tricks?
Sithanen is no fool.
What Sithanen is doing, when agricultural land value is going to be multiplied by 10 or 15 times because it is residential land, when Médine will be parcelling off more land, preparing the “sites”, because it will prepare this and that in the process, soon there will be enormous “value added” to its business.
This “value added” only from an accountant’s point of view because nothing new has been produced.
It is the same piece of land.
Only its nature has been modified and its value has risen by 10 to 15 times.
So in 4 to 5 years’ time Sithanen will come to say, “There you are!” The brave measures I took have brought us an economic growth of 4.5%, 5%, 6%.”
But it is a form of “economic growth” that is an accountancy trick because it is based on speculation.
It is based on artificial land transaction values.
So with these measures, that is the IRS, more assistance on the part of the government is being provided to new IRS projects, to make these wild plans of Médine’s come true, and thus very quickly Sithanen is going to increase “economic growth”, but in a totally artificial way.
This is why I refer to this budget as containing a huge accountancy trick!
So those are the three main budgetary measures.
Then there are a number of other measures that aim to encourage SME’s (Small and Medium Enterprises).
What a Minister of Finance we’ve got!
In one and the same speech, he tells us two different things. When looking at the sugar industry he says that the 11 existing sugar mills in the country that each produces 50,000 tons of sugar can’t survive because they aren’t big enough. He says in order to survive they have to produce at least 100,000 tons in just four huge, huge production units.
But, then he also says that what will save Mauritius is 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 tiny little small enterprises.
To compound his error, he does not even specify what they will produce.
You can’t just repeat SME, SME, SME. SME has become like a kind of mantra that you chant in the hope of it creating employment. In this country SME’s have created jobs, in that country SME’s have created jobs.
But SME’s producing what?
Sithanen is no fool. He knows for a start that the SME’s don’t create jobs.
If you take all the SME’s started and look them up 5 years later, three-quarters will have disappeared altogether, having closed down because they didn’t work.
As it is, that is a waste of resources, just encouraging people to take loans, to go into debt when you know most of them will go bankrupt before five years is over.
The Budget doesn’t give any idea as to what the projected SME’s will make?
What will they produce?
For what market are they supposed to produce?
Sithanen replies to none of these questions.
A tobacconist shop is also an SME.
Imagine if everyone in Mauritius opens up their own tobacconist?
Is that the economic development that will save Mauritius from ruin?
And they are putting lots of emphasis on these SME’s in his budget.
Pressures on Government?
Any Government, when it comes to preparing its Budget, gets put under all sorts of different pressures.
It is important to understand these.
IMF, World Bank and WTO pressure.
Institutions like the IMF, World Bank and the World Trade Organization represent one kind of pressure.
And this pressure will be even stronger than usual because, according to the Financial Secretary, the interim one anyway, Ally Mansoor, negotiations have already begun for a big new World Bank Loan.
When you are negotiating a World Bank loan, you are not just under pressure, but your two thumbs in a veritable vice, being squeezed.
So, that is one kind of pressure.
Local pressure from the bosses side.
The Government is under pressure from the local bourgeoisie and from international financial advisors.
Perhaps people present have read the long interviews of a person called Percy Mistry (he is very much a “mystery”)?
He is a banker, an investment banker, in a group based in Oxford in the UK.
For a long time, he has been given these long interviews, especially in Mauritius Times, and he clearly has a vision, a political project, an economic projection of what he would like Mauritius to become.
And then when we hear the budget being discussed, we keep hearing the name Percy Mistry coming up.
Sithanen himself says, “Go and see what Percy Mistry had to say on this or on that.”
As though the man is an oracle.
He may well be an oracle for finance capital, but we certainly don’t have to take his advice.
Then there are other ideologues like the firm De Chazal Du Mee, or consultancies like Kemp Chatteris, who are always giving their opinions on everything, including on things like the budget.
There are ideologues in the press.
In some newspapers we now have a new kind of “press attachés” who don’t work for government Ministers but for a section of the economy, that is to say for a section of the private sector.
There is one journalist, for instance, that speaks as if she is the MSPA, the sugar oligarchs. Her opinion is that of the sugar bosses.
Another defends the interests of the free zone.
When you read the newspapers, you learn to recognize them.
So anyway, it is clear that the Government is under pressure from different international institutions, local forces or various kinds, and bourgeois ideologues.
Counter-pressures from workers’ side.
There is, however, a counter pressure from the trade union movement and from consumer associations.
But it has for a long time now been very weak.
It is weak for various reasons. The present Government has had clear mandates in three successive elections, general elections, the municipals and village elections.
This makes the regime feel it doesn’t need to concede to this pressure, or any pressure from the masses of the people.
It would, however, not hesitate to “concede” to pressures from its own bank-rollers, the bosses.
Its clear mandate was a mandate to “democratize the economy” and to “put people first”.
This is the type of slogan that, in fact, gave the government its clear electoral victories.
But that is not what it is putting into practice in the Budget.
But the counter-pressure of the unions is also rather weak because unions find it notoriously difficult to think or act outside of the bosses’ logic.
In general, a union aims to get a better treatment for workers, but within the existing system. Unions have difficulty challenging the system itself.
Budget: What kind of transition?
The second part of my paper aims to look at the budget while asking the question “What choice is there?”
What kind of transition could there have been, given the world situation?
What kind of transition could there have been, in relationship to the crisis, in relation, particularly, to employment?
In relationship to the crisis in the sugar industry and textiles?
The choice was either to re-establish “growth” and “create employment” through the re-establishment of the rate of profit.
That is one choice.
There is a crisis looming. Unemployment is increasing drastically. There are more and more lay-offs, and more and more people seeking work.
So, you try to re-launch the economy, as the budget does, by making existing companies make more profits.
This is supposed to increase growth.
On the other hand, there is an alternative. A budget can put forward the basis for a new productive apparatus.
The crisis is in the productive apparatus of textiles and sugar.
And this means that the Budget must face up to this, and suggest alternative sectors, alternative ways of creating employment, of keeping jobs secure, and of how to create jobs fast.
The budget had an obligation to do this.
Our campaign, unlike Sithanen’s budget, takes up this second, real alternative.
Now let us examine the option Sithanen has taken.
What are the concrete measures he proposes? He proposes to facilitate business, in particular to do this through deregulation.
This means cutting out any controls and rules that slow down business.
The Government has brought about deregulation, even from the point of view of the environment.
Long ago, before setting up a business, you had to get an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) to ensure that the environment was not being negatively impacted on.
No longer.
Just start up, wait 3 days, and if you don’t hear any objection, there you go.
Only afterwards, when the factory has already polluted the river that goes past or poisoned everyone in the neighbourhood, only then will the government step in with controls.
This way, they also say, and I’ve mentioned this before, that they will be also helping SME's.
This ultra-liberal option is what Sithanen and the Social Alliance in power have chosen.
They have also chosen to decrease the taxes on the rich.
Sithanen argues that he is decreasing taxes on business and on companies so that they can make more profit, because they are paying less tax.
In the long run, he promises in the Budget that, however much you earn, as an individual or a company, you will only be taxed at the rate of 15%.
This means he is decreasing company tax so that the companies become more profitable.
But it means a reduction that is at the direct expense of State revenue.
Which means it is all of us that are paying for the boss to get a higher rate of profit.
He is also reducing income tax for the rich.
The range that used to pay 25-30% tax will soon disappear.
So, even those earning Rs200,000 a month, not mentioning any names [laughter, as the newspapers that day referred to one such person] will pay at the rate of 15%, the same rate as a teacher earning Rs10,000-15,000 a month.
A flat rate of 15%.
The same rate as IBL, Rogers or Harel Mallac.
Everyone will pay the same rate.
As I mentioned, there are measures that will cause land speculation. Speculation will be done relative to land conversion (one type of use to another), parceling, and through opening the land market to international buyers.
Mauritian land will be re-zoned, parceled and sold off on the international market.
The Budget also has measures that really aim to make Mauritius a country where labour is cheap.
Today Mauritius is not one of the countries where labour is as cheap as in others.
In the past, because Mauritian wage levels were not the lowest, we saw the bosses “delocalising” and moving out to Mozambique, Madagascar, Tanzania and elsewhere, where labour is cheaper.
In this Budget, Sithanen is taking measures that will bring Mauritian wages down to these lower levels. This is being done so as to re-establish competitiveness on the global market.
But whatever their reason for doing this, the result is that the working class and the poor will be getting lower real wages than they used to get for the same amount of work.
Let’s study these measures aimed at lowering the cost of production by lowering wages:
Annual wage compensation is what allows workers to face price rises.
But there is another aspect that is not often mentioned.
When prices increase in Mauritius, it is mainly because of the depreciation of the rupee.
Depreciation is what brings most inflation to Mauritius.
So the increase in prices comes along with depreciation.
What depreciation means is that there are windfall gains, windfall profits, for enterprises that export.
A factory making T-shirts sells one for US$1.
Before depreciation the T-shirt brings the boss US$1, which he goes to the bank and changes for Rs28.
After some years of depreciation, the boss takes the same T-shirt money that is US$1 but this time round the bank gives him Rs32.
This is for the same T-shirt, with depreciation.
So the boss has this windfall profit from a sales price of Rs28 up to one of Rs32.
With wage compensation, the philosophy is that the government and unions say to the boss, “You had to a windfall profit, while the workers are having to pay more for buying the same necessities. You have to share that windfall gain with workers.”
What is important about this way of looking at workers is that we are seeing them as “producers” and not just as “consumers”. But without wage compensation, workers’ real wages will get lower year after year.
NRB and PRB to be replaced.
In the Budget, Sithanen clearly announces that institutions such as the National Remuneration Board (NRB) and Pay Research Bureau (PRB) will disappear, and be replaced by one called the “National Wages Council”.
And in particular the Awards or Remuneration Orders that the NRB and PRB come up with so as to determine minimum wages for each sector at any time, will be done away with.
These “awards” determine minimum work conditions for different grades of workers in many, many different sectors.
The bosses do not want this.
They want all workers to be “multi-skilled”.
This way, when there is no work in the factory, when, say, orders have dropped, they can send you out to sweep the yard.
That’s the kind of multi-skilling the boss wants.
The boss also wants to be able to benefit from unemployment.
He wants to be able to offer an unemployed person less money and lesser conditions than the worker he already employs. He knows that unemployed workers will work for less, because otherwise they risk dying of starvation.
The bosses will tell you, “Look! You’re dying of starvation as it is. Why not come work for me for Rs 12 a day?” and if your children are going hungry, you will end up working for Rs12 a day.
The existence of the Awards or Remuneration Orders did not allow this.
What Sithanen is doing will introduce this kind of practice.
The bosses will be free to offer Rs12 a day.
The Budget is proposing to link wages to “productivity”, and also the bosses “capacity to pay”.
This means in order to get a wage increase, you will have to produce more.
If you can’t, then your wage will remain unchanged.
Even while the same wage buys you less staples.
And as you know in our country, no boss ever has the capacity to pay.
So when they come along with this “capacity to pay”, they are really bluffing, because they know that on principle the bosses can’t pay.
On principle, all bosses have been running at a loss all along.
If you walk along La Chaussée Street, you can see them queuing up to beg!
On principle, they are very poor. [Laughter.]
Another measure in the Budget that we judge to be important is that the government is to bring in a law to decrease the notice a boss gives before sacking you.
Today, if you have so many years service, the boss has to give you notice of one month, two months or three months, before sacking you. Government is changing this.
They intend to decrease the amount of Severance Allowance that the boss has to pay to dismiss a worker.
In the budget speech, if it were not tragic, you would have to laugh at how they say this.
They say that they will decrease the “cost of separation”, meaning a boss gets “separated” from his worker, as if the sacking were a divorce.
So, Government says that the “cost of separation” should not be too high.
And this when it is the worker who is losing his job, his income, and his means to feed his family.
To Rama Sithanen, that is just a “cost of separation” to his boss.
He only sees this as the price it will cost the boss to separate himself from his worker.
Budget announces postponing retirement age.
And of course, there is the postponement of the retirement age to 65.
It is now, as everyone knows, 60.
That’s when they have to start paying you your pension.
From 2008 and until 2018, the change will be effected.
Someone said to me, “What?
With this measure, I’ll never get to retirement.
Every time I get there, they’ll add on 2 months!”.
Anyway from the year 2018, retirement age is 65.
I mentioned at the Forum organized by the Federation of Civil Service and Other Unions that when you take the postponement of retirement together with the Budget’s introduction of seasonal labour and casual work, it is very serious.
Take the example of a 61-year-old bricklayer.
He will have to wait four years before he gets his pension at 65.
But who is the employer that will take on a 61-year-old bricklayer on his worksite to lay bricks and plaster ceilings?
The last measure to crown it all is when Sithanen announces that there will now be just a single job market, free zone and non-free zone.
We all know what that means.
When the entire budget is aimed at lowering wages, it means “single” in the sense of lowering the non-free-zone sector to the level of the free zone.
Everyone knows that work conditions in the free zone are inferior to those in other sectors.
And we remember when Government finally respected the demand for equal work for equal pay for women and men, they lowered the men’s wages to the level of the women’s. Then there was “equality”. The same thing will be happening again.
Lalit’s campaign for an alternative political economy.
To end with, let us look at our campaign, the one we have been running since before the general election, the campaign for a political struggle towards an alternative to the present economy.
We are campaigning so that the compensation money (for the fall in the price of sugar) that Europe is offering to pay is put to good use. What is being done with that money? Is it just going to the sugar estate bosses for them to sack workers? Is it going to be used to develop new work sectors?
We are campaigning for unemployment benefit.
We are campaigning for labourers and artisans who are laid off to be given land to plant on.
We are campaigning so that foreign exchange gets taken out of the hands of the private sector because they have been using their recent access to foreign exchange so as to intentionally provoke depreciation in the value of the rupee, thus raking in money, and thus also causing the prices everyone pays for every-day goods to go up.
Now that the Government has announced its Budget, in what way will this affect the campaign we are already running?
Clearly the Budget has exposed the boss’s agenda very clearly.
The budget has exposed the agenda of the economic and political ruling class and also of the local and international ruling class.
Never before has their agenda been exposed so nakedly as it has been by the Sithanen budget.
In our campaign we must denounce this.
In our campaign we must also denounce the incapacity of the political regime to protect employment and workers’ standard of living, and expose how this is as a result of their having adopted the bosses’ agenda.
We must also evidently put into question the very logic of capitalist globalization.
At the moment it is more appropriate than it has been until now, that is to say it has become relatively easy, to put into question the logic of capitalist globalization, and the logic of capitalism, itself.
This is because the Sithanen budget exposes the cruel face of the capitalist system.
We must now convince other organizations, the trade unions, and associations, to join us in our campaign because it has become a life-or-death struggle for ordinary people.
And it will become urgent now that we aim (together with other organizations and other people) at setting up a political program, not just for the sugar industry and the free zones, but at setting up a political program that aims to bring about a thorough change in the whole of society – economic, political and social.
We are developing this kind of political program that aims at this real change, that is to say, a socialist change.
We shouldn’t forget that although we are running this campaign here against Sithanen’s budget and against the local bourgeoisie, the struggle we are embarked on goes beyond this.
It is a regional struggle with others in the region, and an international struggle with others worldwide.
In Lalit we already have many international contacts.
That is how we see the struggle ahead.
Thank you, comrades.
LALIT’s Transitional Demands.
A Critical Analysis.
I would like to thank Lalit for inviting me to be here during the process of developing a common understanding of the situation in the country, and to share ideas as to what Lalit as a political party is doing in terms of developing a new political economy.
I’ve had the opportunity to read the proposals and demands put forward by Lalit to tackle the crisis that is hitting Mauritius.
In fact, the crisis is affecting the population already, and doing so violently.
It is a situation that is becoming dangerous.
We do not know how it will evolve.
We might be led to believe that it is a “containable” crisis, as Sithanen clearly believes it is when he says that in two or three years’ time everything will be just fine.
He is clearly bluffing.
He has no idea where the present crisis is leading.
As comrade Ram Seegobin explained, the crisis is imminent.
Even if we didn’t call it a crisis, the structural problems in the Mauritian capitalist system and the problems of the Mauritian economy in its relationship with the world economy – which used to give the appearance of being protected from the consequences of changes in the world economy – make it abundantly clear for everyone to see that the Mauritian economy and even the whole of Mauritian society are already undergoing massive upheavals.
And it is working people and the poor who are suffering the worst effects of these upheavals.
I know that comrades in Lalit and those present today have already started to discuss many of the aspects of this crisis.
Today is not the beginning of this work.
Today my talk won’t be a blow-by-blow commentary on each of the 12 demands that Lalit put forward.
I will discuss them globally as being Lalit’s response to its accurate identification of the gravity of the crisis.
I hope to refer to one or two of the demands in some detail, as I proceed with my speech.
In particular, I will explain what flows from the Lalit demands: What kind of ideology?
What dynamics?
That is to say, when we struggle for these demands, where is it likely to lead us?
Where ought it to lead us?
And what outcome can we expect from a political campaign on the basis of these demands?
I will not go into much detail, I will just touch on things like: What does capitalism in its present form show us about the real, deep-seated nature of capitalism itself?
How does this expose the sorry state that capitalism is actually in?
The degree of its bankruptcy?
How does capitalism in its present form affect people, people in their thousands.
Let’s take the two sectors, sugar and textiles.
They clearly show that a large part of our economy is in deep, deep trouble.
It’s important to realize this.
The economic history of Mauritius has been dominated by the sugar sector.
Since Independence this has continued unchanged.
After Independence, one of the emerging sectors that created jobs was the textile industry.
Today we can see both sugar and the textile industry struggling in something like death throes.
This is affecting the entire Mauritian economy.
All its structures are affected, and the production apparatus as a whole is affected by it.
This is why these shocks have brought, are bringing, and will go on bringing all sorts of problems.
The first problem is the loss of jobs.
This is forcing the capitalists and the Government in power to take decisions to re-organize the Mauritian economy.
They are re-organizing the economy, precisely because the way it was, isn’t working anymore.
However, they are re-organizing it in a way that puts the whole burden of the re-structuring and re-orientation on to the working class and the poor.
The Government and the employers are not looking at what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of people directly concerned when these two main sectors of the economy are collapsing and heading for bankruptcy.
They are principally concerned with setting up new sectors in a way that ensures the continuation of their profit and their capacity to continue making profit, whatever the social cost and despite the cost to the ordinary people.
It looks like something straightforward, but it is important that we understand this.
What is to be done.
This leads us to pose the question: What is to be done in a situation like this?
Should we restrict ourselves to defending workers’ interests, as the Unions do, and as Unions are supposed to do?
That is to say, when there is a threat of job losses, do we just fight job losses?
When there is a rise in the cost of living, do we just fight to try to get, say, a 10% wage rise?
Do we only fight against the boss’s policy of “hire and fire”, of their taking people on and sacking them at will?
Do we fight only against the destruction of legal frameworks like the Labour Act, institutions like the NRB, PRB etc, when they come under threat?
Should we restrict the struggle to just protecting acquired rights, when they come under attack or should we go to the heart of the problem?
I would like now to look at Lalit’s demands.
What do they imply?
What is their political importance?
What political dimension do these demands have?
A political party like Lalit is not the same thing as a workers’ organization like a trade union.
A trade union’s very function is to defend workers’ rights.
However, in a period of crisis, a political party like Lalit has other responsibilities.
In my opinion, a party like Lalit has three responsibilities.
The first responsibility of a political party like Lalit is analysis. It must accurately analyze the economic crisis. It must analyze both the local and the international dimensions of the crisis.
That means understanding the contradictions and weaknesses inside the Mauritian economy, and how these structural weaknesses are affected by the changes in the world economy.
Mauritius is not only small geographically, but also economically; relative to the world economy, it is insignificant.
If Mauritius disappeared tomorrow, it wouldn’t be a great loss to the world economy.
But if a country like the USA, India, China, or the European Union were to disappear, the world economy would find itself drastically altered.
But, although the Mauritian economy might be insignificant to the global economic system, the people who live in Mauritius are important, the men, women and children living here are important.
They are important to us, but they are not important to the Mauritian capitalists or to international capitalists.
This again seems to be a simple fact, but it is very important for workers, workers’ organizations and trade unions to realize this simple fact.
Human beings living in Mauritius are not important as human beings for the Mauritian capitalists or the international capitalists.
They are only interested in you as workers because you can work for them, and through you and your work, they can enrich themselves.
They are interested in you so that they can make profits from your labour.
What’s serious about this last Budget is that this Government has, in it, accepted the capitalist logic.
It’s important to understand this.
Because the Government that prepared this budget came out of the social democratic movement, supposedly.
It is a Government that originated in the workers’ movement, and indeed its name is literally “the Labour Party”, to remind us.
So that you can follow my argumentation later, I’d like to say that it is not normal that a Labour Government comes up with a budget like this one.
It is not an ordinary event for anyone who studies history, for anyone who knows Labour’s history.
Because the social base and the electoral base of Labour are in the working class and the poor. It has always tried to set up, within the Mauritian State, certain sections of the State itself, that protect workers, sections that are in favour of workers.
For example, free education, free health services, subsidizing certain costs of education, free transport for pensioners and students.
One finds these kinds of measures not only in Mauritius, but also abroad.
For example, in European countries, where a Government born out of the workers’ movement, like the British Labour party or the French Socialist party, came to power, in the normal course of history, they have created institutions within the State, within the capitalist system, that, to some extent protected workers, and they have conducted their politics so as to give a certain degree of protection to working people.
So, when we use the word “ultra liberal” to describe this budget, we must follow the logic we’ve just set out.
We must analyze the Labour Party’s trajectory, and take a hard look at its propaganda since the General Elections, to see whether Labour will be continuing to protect the downtrodden as it says it is doing.
Can we still in 2006 maintain this same analysis of the Labour Party?
We must look at the Labour party’s membership and where it comes from.
We must also closely analyze the politics the Labour party has systematically followed for the past 15 years, making sure we do not only look at what they said in public meetings and during electoral campaigns.
For how long, despite its history as a working class movement, will we be able to continue regarding the Labour Party as a social democrat political organization, one that still has links with the working class movement?
In fact, the answer to this question may be of primary importance for our future strategies.
Any future political strategies will involve political struggles.
When I say that the first task of a political party is to analyze the situation, I don’t mean just the economic situation, but also the political situation.
This means we need an analysis of the entire political scene, what parties there are, analyzing the MMM whose trajectory we’ve understood only too well, Labour Party and also the other parties like Mouvement Republicain (MR) and other left organizations like Muvman Premye Me.
We should analyze all the political actors, all the political movements, all the political organizations and all the trade union organizations.
We must analyze them and evaluate their potential, whether to help or hinder the workers’ struggle.
Are they useful?
What is their role?
Will they contribute to advancing the workers’ struggle, or are they part of the problem workers have to face?
This means identifying who is in Government, who is in which party, from the PMSD to the MR, we have to analyze the whole lot of them.
We have to be conscious of their real role, not just what they say they are doing.
I believe Lalit has already undertaken this task.
Develop Demands
The second task of a political party is to put forward a program based on demands.
Lalit has already undertaken this, when it puts forward these 12 demands.
However, this is not Lalit’s complete program.
As Ram Seegobin said in his paper earlier, there is a need to develop a program not only on the economy, not only on difficulties facing workers, but also on all the other social aspects of the crisis, as it unfolds.
I won’t go into too much detail here, but it is evident that there are problems of all kinds: violence in society; difficulties for women; problems students face; difficulties old people face; the drugs problem.
So, naturally, we need to develop a program that covers all these social problems.
Popularize program amongst broad masses.
The third task of a political party like Lalit is, after an analysis has been made of the situation, after a program of demands has been outlined, to find the best ways of popularizing the program and the demands.
This implies communicating your Program, making it known in working class milieus, amongst workers and the poor, until the entire country knows what your positions are, what you are demanding, why you demanding it, and how the demands will lead to genuine solutions to the crises in society.
This work of popularizing your Program, from the very moment when you put it forward, is totally different from the way parties like the MMM and Labour proceed. Their leaders just stand up on a lorry, give a speech, and the people are left to stand and listen, applaud and cheer, and set off firecrackers.
You don’t just put forward your program in the course of an electoral meeting.
You have to discuss it with trade unionists, discuss it with members of associations, and as discussion begins, you will notice that you start to develop your program further.
It is not the kind of program the party drafts here in GRNW and then goes out and tells other people about.
In the process of being discussed, you will find the program will be enriched, broadened, it may also narrow down, but what is important is that you, as a party member, as you talk to other people, you all begin to share a common understanding, and to develop a common understanding.
And this may just be the most difficult task of all.
Transitional Demands and Taking Power.
In the tradition of the working class movement, the demands like those being put forward by Lalit are known as “Transitional Demands”.
To explain a bit better, I will talk a bit about the particular period of the worldwide crisis in the capitalist system at the time this idea of “transitional demands” was born.
Transitional Demands were made consciously for the first time in 1938 on the eve of the World War II (WWII).
They were put forward just before war was declared, at a time when the fascist movement in Germany and in Spain was causing such terrible destruction to the workers’ movements and organizations, that eventually the working class movements in these countries were crushed physically through killings, assassinations, imprisonment, and these defeats were the precursor to WWII.
In this period, just before the beginning of the WWII, Leon Trotsky with the help of his other comrades developed a program called a “Transitional Program” (In French it is usually known as “Programme Transitoire”, but in Lalit we understand you use the term “Program tranzisyonel” because transposition from French into Kreol gives the idea that it is ephemeral).
The full name of the Trotsky Program is “The Death Throes of Capitalism and the Tasks of the 4th International”.
The 4th International is an organization, which Trotsky created on the basis of this program.
The Program on the Death Throes of Capitalism also spoke of the mass mobilization around a transitional program as the preparation for taking power.
It’s on this last aspect mentioned that I would like to lay stress, that is to say on popular mobilization, the mobilization of workers and poor people on the basis of the demands, as a process that prepares the way to taking power.
Obviously, in the Trotsky book at the time, there was a series of demands for that period of history, but even now, some of the demands are still up-to-date.
As I will be explaining later, a demand can be valuable, but not necessarily valuable at a particular time in history.
If there is not an analysis of what is actually happening in the country, of the particular economic conditions that are prevailing, and of the condition the working class finds itself in, then we might say that this is a “good demand” and go ahead and fight for it, when in fact it can be a “good demand”, but we also have to be sure that when we raise the issue, when we explain the demand, it will, in fact, be capable of mobilizing people around it.
I will come back to this point later.
What is important is that the trade union movement already has a list of demands put forward for the workers.
However, a transitional demand is directional, it gives an orientation to workers towards the seizing of power.
But, if today you go and say to the working class in Mauritius, “We are in crisis, lets go and seize power”, workers will think you are crazy.
And they will be right to think you’re crazy [laughter].
Transitional demands have to start from where workers actually are, and from there, put forward the path towards seizing power.
We need to understand that many people are angry.
Bérenger for instance is saying, “The mood out there in the country is not good”.
We have to look at why it is that, despite the fact that people see it is an unacceptable budget, and even before the presentation of the budget when people knew they were becoming poorer and poorer, despite the fact that many workers are being sacked, despite many factory closures over the past 2 or 3 years, despite so many people loosing their jobs in the sugar industry, despite all the suffering due to price rises, why is it that despite all this, people are not saying, “Let’s go and take power, these ministers don’t know how to govern”?
On the contrary we hear people saying, “Chuck Bérenger out, chuck Pravind Jugnauth out as Minister of Finance, Ramgoolam is telling us that he will ‘put the people first’ and we are the people, so they will put us first, so let us vote for Ramgoolam.
Let’s vote Sithanen.
This is what actually happened.
And if we are not careful in 5 years’ time, we will hear people saying, “Ramgoolam lied to us. Bérenger is saying ‘Put people really first’, Bérenger is finally talking sense. Let’s vote for Bérenger!” [Laughter] If we aren’t careful, this is what is going to happen once again.
In fact, if we look at the last four elections, we find that this is exactly what happened. If we can’t go beyond replacing one politician by another, and if people think we’re crazy when we say, “Let’s take power ourselves”, the question is “What is to be done?”
What is to be done?
Capitalists manipulate ideological questions.
To understand the question of “What is to be done?” we should start from an initial point of departure, something which sounds very simple but is very important: We should start from the reality of daily life in a capitalist society, which means starting with all the complexity of the way in which the capitalist system is organized and the way in which a pro-capitalist government acts so that it manages to control society.
How on earth does it succeed in governing the way it does, that is to say, in the interests of the bosses?
How does it manage this?
We can’t just say it’s because there’s a police force, and the Riot Police that can charge against us with tear-gas, and “batons”.
It’s not just by means of repression that the government can govern as it does.
It’s not only because of their capacity to repress us if we rise in rebellion or take part in demonstrations.
Of course, they can do this.
They have got their police and army.
But this is not the main explanation for how year in year out, they govern in ways that are against your interests and yet they stay in control of government.
In fact, the government and capitalists control the economy, and they control society.
We need to understand a fundamental point, that it is not through violence that the bosses and capitalists control you, or that government controls you.
They control you by means of manipulating you ideologically.
For example, they make you believe that “private property” is a good and normal thing.
They say it means you have your little bit of land or a nice wristwatch or a good pair of glasses, and that these are yours.
They say our laws, our Constitution, itself, protect your right to enjoy private property.
That is, they mean while each of us has a watch, or a motorcycle, you own your house, they, the capitalists, have a right to own three-quarters of Mauritius.
They, unlike us, have the right to own a sugar estate.
They have the right to own a whole bank.
They have the right to own the things that make society function.
That means they have the right to own hundreds, even thousands, or hectares of land.
They need to own their own factories.
They need property rights over what we call the means of production.
And they put these two kinds of ownership on the same level.
And then you end up saying, “It’s quite natural. They are owners of property and I am also an owner of property because I’ve got a motorbike, I own my house. So, it’s a just law and we have a fine Constitution”.
They make you believe that your ownership and his are the same thing.
They make you believe that “private property” is a good thing, just the same for everyone.
And especially they make you believe that all private property is the same thing.
This belief is very thoroughly rooted in us.
If you go and ask a worker, he will tell you, “Everybody has the right to become a property owner. Absolutely everybody. Mr. Capitalist and I, on this matter at least, are in total agreement. It isn’t an issue.”
And obviously, on the question of private property, it is safe to say that the totality of the legal system protects it.
And just in the same way as, if someone steals your motorbike, the police will open an inquiry, so, in exactly the same way, if you steal the bosses’ sugar mill, you will also have to be locked up, or shot at.
It is through this type of ideological manipulation that the capitalists remain in control of society.
So, this kind of control on the very way we are made to think needs to be exposed.
Elections and Bourgeois Democracy.
Elections and the right to vote are a good thing.
It’s a good thing for everyone.
But what they succeed in making you think is that because you have the right to vote once every 5 years or in a by-election from time to time, that this is what is called “democracy”.
They tell you you are living in a democratic country.
So, the politicians invite you to a public meeting, provide you with some firecrackers, a hamper of food and some drinks, and they explain that there is an electoral campaign to organize, so here are the flags, or here’s the cloth, you make the flags, and we’ll organize a big rally.
They tell you to do all this and then say, “This is what democracy is”.
They make you believe it firmly when they tell you, “Your country is not Africa. Mauritius is not X or Y country, because here we are democrats”.
Why are we democrats?
Every 5 years you vote for Jugnauth, Bérenger, and then the other Jugnauth, then the other someone else.
This is what democracy is all about, they say.
One thing they don’t want you to know is who exactly they govern for, once you’ve voted.
They tell you “You’ve got democratic rights”.
It’s a lie.
You do not really have democratic rights.
It’s not a real democracy, when in the police you have people like Raddhoa beating up so many people!
You have the right to vote, but this does not mean that you have your democratic rights in practice, in everyday life, for real.
No sooner have you cast you vote than they dish up a budget like this one.
No sooner have you cast your vote than the Government, instead of governing in your interests, instead of developing an economy in your interests, governs in the interests of someone else.
What is the point of having voted for people, who will serve the interests of a handful of capitalists, a minority?
Democracy does not mean the rule of the minority to the detriment of the majority.
Democracy means, and should mean, that the majority interests rule.
In our “democratic system”, the one we have until now, things are run in the interests of a minority.
You hear people saying, “We won the majority.
We won 50 seats.
Our political party is strong.
Our demands will become a reality!”
It is not true!
People say it, but they don’t realize the irony.
When people mobilize behind their demands, when they struggle to make practical, real life gains that are in their own interests, they could, in fact, succeed.
This is a demand that has been won in many capitalist countries in the world, in Britain, Italy, France, Germany.
In many countries, the working class movement has succeeded in imposing on the capitalist economy that when a worker can’t get work, when a young person is looking for a job, he or she has to get an unemployment benefit in order to live.
We should always bear in mind that it is not government or the boss who out of their generosity give us things.
These are demands that, after World War II the capitalists knew they had to concede otherwise they would end up without a capitalist system at all in those countries!
Sometimes the capitalists and their political lackeys agree to concessions on certain demands in order to avoid losing everything.
It is always the balance of forces between you, as the working class, and them as the capitalists, that determines whether your demands will be met.
It doesn’t just depend on whether you’ve got a good trade union negotiator, a clever lawyer, a good judge, as to which concessions the capitalist will make to your demands.
It depends on your capacity to organize, and on the strength of your organization and also on its independence from the capitalists.
It also depends on what your strategy is, what program you have and where it is leading you.
People who are already members or supporters of a political party, workers who go to political meetings, already know all this.
However, the ideological manipulation that I referred to earlier (on things like private property and elections) makes this kind of knowledge of where your interests lie difficult to acquire.
Without going into too much detail, just think for a moment of the amount of brainwashing we get through the newspapers and TV?
There are so many sources of division and so much intentionally spread confusion that many workers, hundreds of thousands, in fact, who don’t manage to discern where their own interests lie within the capitalist system, nor to realize the danger that capitalism represents for them.
For these reasons, it is often only when people are actively struggling on the basis of demands that they themselves find sensible and reasonable as well as in their own interests, demands that they come to actually see clearly and to understand in practice and agree to stand up for when confronted with the inevitable resistance they meet, only then do they find themselves in a position to oppose this bourgeois ideology.
It is not only workers who need to be rallied. Nor just the unemployed that happen to have a free day to be present. Nor is it just numbers. We’ve seen from the Kaya rebellion in 1999 that numbers, however huge, are not enough. There needs to be unity, not just in the sense of everyone is at the same place at the same time, but unity in our heads. By that, I mean unity on the question of what program there is in our heads and on the questions of how and when we can make progress on our demands.
This is the process that takes the most time in struggles.
It is also what needs the most experience.
Because people will not all have the same ideas on what to do and what not to do, for the simple reason that the workers’ movement, the trade union movement and the political movement are made up of many different organizations, and people with many different ideas. The ideas of one organization are not the same as those of another.
They can even be diametrically opposed.
And even in the development of the program itself, as I mentioned, it isn’t a question of sitting and writing something.
You can’t content yourself to draft something and show people and ask them if they agree or don’t agree.
The program must be constantly, permanently discussed, convincing new people of its pertinence, and being convinced by other peoples’ ideas which, after discussion, get incorporated. But what is important and takes time and experience is to constantly be in discussion with the organizations that agree to struggle on the basis of the demands in the program.
What exactly is a program of demands, and how does it function?
It contains analyses of how we understand the capitalist system, and it involves communicating this understanding not only to the most advanced sections of the working class, who understand a lot already and who have a highly developed political consciousness already, but to the greatest number of workers and the greatest number of other people who suffer because of the capitalist system.
This is the aim of a program of demands.
But, as you fight for these demands, and you get the kind of resistance we have just mentioned from the government and the capitalists and particularly from the pro-capitalist press, you have to, as part of your program, have the capacity to justify it in the face of criticism and resistance against it, and to convince more and more people during the course of the confrontations, that these demands are what in reality represent the solution to our problems.
And at this point, something very important happens. The people who have already mobilized behind the demands, find that the more they mobilize, the more explanations they have to develop, the more debates they win, the more resistance hardens against these demands, and this means you have further opportunities to argue in favour of your demands.
You won’t win demands that are against the political strategy of your adversaries if you allow the government and the bosses to win during the course of these confrontations.
The demands are ours, and it is us that mobilize behind them.
And this is the kind of consciousness that develops during the course of a number of conflicts.
It is the consciousness that some kind of revolution will be necessary. People begin to realize, in the course of the struggle that it will have to be us, ourselves who put into practice our demands.
If we say to the bosses, “OK, give us unemployment benefit, give us, say, Rs3,000 a month”.
What will you learn in practice?
You can negotiate with Finance Minister Sithanen 20 times, and on the 21st time around, you will find that the Special Mobile Force fires on you if you persist.
He’s said no to your demand, and you are persisting.
If you become too threatening, then he will take very serious measures to prevent you making your demands.
This realization is something that has to be reached collectively if you are to win gains in your interests.
You can’t count on the government or on the bosses for your demands.
As people realize this, this is what makes the masses of the people stand up for the program.
So we have to persist with our demands, and it is possible that the masses of the people will rapidly develop an understanding. Sometimes in history, the speed with which people develop an understanding is must faster than you expect. People just come to the conclusion, collectively, that now is the time to abandon past hollow hopes placed in the government and bosses.
If we want a truly good education system, or if we want a truly good service in the hospitals, if we want to create employment, we can’t just sit around and expect the Mauritius Employers’ Federation to invest.
They are lying to us. In fact, they have lied to us for far too long.
This is why it is so important that all past experience is accumulated, and that workers coming into the mobilization for the first time keep in mind all that’s happened in past struggles.
What past mobilizations were there?
Which demands have already been put forward?
Why was the past struggle for the demands lost?
Because past defeats are important because they bear lessons for us today and for the future.
Why did the big 1971 general strike not bring the fall of the repressive government that voted the Public Order Act and that postponed elections?
Especially as the MMM had extraordinarily wide support in the country.
We have to remember that the MMM won a by-election, controlled all the Municipalities in Mauritius, and in the 1976 General Election, it won 34 seats out of 70 in Parliament, almost half of Parliament.
Why did this not end in the taking of power and a socialist government?
There are important reasons why not.
When you mobilize behind socialist demands and demands in favour of the poor, these demands cannot be satisfied by a group of people, like a political party saying, as its strategy, “What you do is you vote for me, and then I’ll do this for you!”
These demands will only be met when the people, the workers themselves through their organizations, whether clubs, associations, unions, or political parties like Lalit or Muvman Premye Me, realize that it is only through their own struggle and their own mobilization that their demands will be able to be met.
This is very important.
Socialist power will not be brought about by a group of people sitting in Parliament and voting a law.
Of course, Parliament can vote laws.
They can for example vote to introduce unemployment benefit, but they will only do it if you are mobilized strongly enough outside of Just as they might five years later revoke the same law and do away with unemployment benefit. If the bosses and government see that the workers’ movement has perhaps weakened, that the capitalist system is heading for some crisis, that profits are falling, that bankruptcies are on the rise, then they will stop unemployment benefit.
And that is, in fact, exactly what is happening right now.
What the workers’ movement of the past had won, when today’s workers try to defend rights acquired in the past, the Prime Minister Ramgoolam says that in Mauritius all acquired rights have been lost.
That’s what he says in the newspaper.
He says, “What acquired rights are you talking about? The Labour Act, Severance Allowance, tax-free lump sums?”
He announces that acquired rights are over.
The whole of Mauritius, he announces, has lost acquired rights.
But notice that some rights have not been lost at all, for example the bosses still have the right to exploit people, the right to make profits, these are still acquired rights for them!
This is the important thing about crises like the one we are facing: You, unlike the bosses, lose all your rights.
Whether there’s a crisis or not, the bosses’ rights continue unchallenged.
You can be humiliated, you can even die of hunger, and they will go on keeping their same living standards.
They will go on changing their Mercedes every year or two.
Crisis or no crisis.
This is what Ram [Seegobin] was explaining just before me. How they want you to bear the entire brunt of a crisis, which is of their making, it is a crisis in their system.
Start where people are.
A Program of Demands, to continue, must always start with the working class movement in its existing, present state.
For example, today the working class movement is on the defensive. Right now Public Sector workers are mobilizing, rising up in protest, making demands.
And it seems that on some questions, like the tax on the lump sums, Sithanen is making concessions.
The question is why does this happen like this?
Because there was a problem, then the federations took the issue to the Minister, then workers demonstrated, then there were negotiations, and yet everything went back to how it was before.
Mobilization dies down as demands are supposed to have been met, even though you didn’t win them all.
And then the merry-go-round just continues.
A transitional program aims to stop this phenomenon where mobilization ends abruptly after concessions. A transitional program continues to give direction to workers even after certain demands have been met.
It shows that the interests of workers as a whole have not been assured by the concession.
You need an economy that creates jobs and that gives a guarantee that everyone has a job and a house and a certain standard of living.
When you get one concession, it does not mean you have got these things.
This is why the very way that you organize the demands in a transitional program, the way you present them, is special.
The demands form part of a whole. You don’t just tick one demand off your list, and go back home.
By contrast, a revolutionary organization that mobilizes on the basis of demands in a transitional program is completely different.
It understands that working peoples’ problems will not be resolved in the interests of working people so long as politicians like Sithanen or Bérenger are in power, or so long as the bosses still control the factories, the banks and everything else they control.
A revolutionary organization has understood that the experience of history has shown that this is just not possible.
But, however difficult, you have to work with the trade union organizations, work at convincing them that your program is in the interests of workers’ demands, because you need support from the trade unions and you often have to work with the leaders they happen to have.
So, you will work at this, in the knowledge that it will never ever happen that all the union leaders at the same time agree with you.
But what is interesting in the nature of a transitional program is that as you mobilize around it, the unions throw up new leaders.
We saw that in the August 1979 strike.
In fact, you see it all over the world when there is mobilization.
During the course of the struggle around a transitional program, you will have workers who didn’t even know they were leaders of the union movement, because they had never been elected to the committee before.
If you tell one of them they’re a leader, they will laugh.
They will say they are a worker who has understood things.
But you will notice that he is someone who can make proposals at the level of his neighbourhood, at his worksite or in the union.
He might indeed get into trouble with the President of the union, “What are you talking about? You get locked up for that kind of thing!
And this is how, in history, you do find that you can take power through mobilization, and not just take power by some coup d’etat or through a guerrilla war which then gets declared “socialism”.
Through mobilization that involves action by the workers themselves on the basis of their demands that respond to today’s pressing problems and, at the same time show you that your interests will not be taken care of or even maintained without addressing the biggest of all problems that workers have.
How to take political power?
How to take economic power from the hands of the capitalist class?
Thank you.
I want to thank Ram for his introduction, on who I am, and on the topic we are going to talk about.
Although I am hoping to stick quite closely to the notes that I made so that Lindsey can translate and sum up my notes, I do have to start with two small digressions.
Already I’m disrupting my arrangement with Lindsey!
Times of creativity.
I think there is an important thing that may be we don’t talk about enough and which I thought was important to throw in at the beginning so that maybe we can come back to it later.
I think that the party, in particular, (and I want to talk more about this at the end of the talk), has to prepare itself psychologically.
I mean that it prepares itself not just theoretically, in terms of looking at its objectives, its analysis of the situation, but also in terms of the psychology of its militants.
Party militants need to realize that they are looking, throughout the period, at a historical period that will test their energy, their adaptability, the speed with which they respond;
their preparedness, basically, to come to terms with the fact that there are new ways of learning, there are new ways of doing things, and that inasmuch as it is important that we go through the crisis with all the preparation that is needed, it is also very important that we understand that crises are very new situations, and they require new kinds of energies.
In fact, the biggest problem in crises has tended to be the political parties of the working class.
And I’m not talking about political parties which are reformist, those that are abandoning the working class.
Those are immaterial to this issue.
But I’m talking about the difficulties that the revolutionary parties have in coming to terms with the need for a shift in their own psychology.
Not in their parties’ analyses – because they spend a long time preparing their politics, reading about and grounding themselves; but it’s the shift in the psychology that’s necessary during crises, because of the way a whole new tempo of struggle develops, the way in which things are posed differently.
We know that the biggest fight in the Russian Revolution was fought within the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party.
It was about whether: should we move with the mass, should we slow the mass down, what should we do?
As luck has it, the Russians resolved that problem, and they managed to catch up with the mass and move in step with it.
The Communist party of Germany, the KPD, on the other hand, faced the same problem, and was killed by its paralysis in the face of major shifts within the working class.
So I think these two points are a kind of preface to our discussion: much as we are talking about the problems facing the working class in crises, it is important that we be mindful of the fact that we are talking about potentially exciting political periods.
If you are a social justice activist, if you are for socialism, crises are exciting periods where new energies are unleashed.
All the tiredness of meeting after meeting evaporates, and new energies are released.
Crisis of expectations among all classes.
Now, the importance of a crisis and why it has to be treated as a special situation is certainly that the crisis represents a very profound change for all sections of society.
Totality of society.
The second thing is a point Ram has already made in his introduction; around this concept of understanding this new totality of things affected.
That is, that an economic crisis affects everything as a totality.
Usually, when not in times of crisis, in our normal everyday life, our very lives get compartmentalized by the way capitalism functions and the way capitalism is institutionalised: We go to “work”, come back, and then we close the door.
Then we are in “the family”.
Then when we go out, and later close another door, and then we go to “associations” that we are in, a sport club or something like that.
So we create compartments.
The fact is that all these compartments, behind our backs, so to speak, are related, are connected to each other, in quite fundamental and interesting ways.
During a crisis, all these connections suddenly become visible.
What were issues that were hidden from us, because we made assumptions about our pensions, for example, or we made assumptions about our relations to our partners, we made assumptions about all kinds of things.
suddenly what happens is that capitalism as such almost comes to the fore, as it were, in the crisis.
It reveals all its interconnections.
Sometimes Parliaments and other powerful institutions are taken up by the crisis.
They can be paralysed by it.
They are moved by it.
Because the connections between these economic and social, these political and cultural issues suddenly become apparent to us.
So, the important thing is that, although as a matter of shorthand we talk about an “economic crisis”, we should be mindful of the fact that an economic crisis can never really unfold in one compartment (called “economic”) in society.
If it is serious and deep enough – and I think that the crisis that is unfolding in Mauritius is showing signs of being quite deep – then we will have the entirety of society thrown into crisis.
So every time we talk about an “economic crisis”, it is important that we are mindful of the fact that the economy is a social relationship, it is not a production of mere “things”, but it is how we relate to society, how the power balance is organised.
And that power balance, in strategic terms, is what holds the players in society together.
When we talk about what Lalit is doing at the moment, with a program of economic alternatives; in order for such a program to be able to respond to the totality of the crisis it cannot be restricted merely to what the bourgeois press understands as the “economy”.
The bourgeois theorists always try to keep that compartmentalization.
They say there is a small problem in sugar, textiles is in difficulty, but let’s leave all the other things in place.
By doing that, they are creating areas, almost fortifications, where you cannot challenge them.
Now I want to talk a little bit about what constitute the main elements of what we should conceive of or think about, when we talk about an economic program that wants to put an alternative view of society, an alternative approach to resolving the crisis.
I’ll go through my points quickly then, and I’ll make a few remarks on some of the issues raised in the Lalit paper and then talk more about some of the general questions of strategy afterwards.
I think in the first instance, (and this is undertaken in the Lalit paper), we speak of one having to provide a coherent analysis of the economic problems of the country, of the socio-economic structure, of the sources of the crisis.
In this case you are talking of the crisis in the sugar industry, of the textile industry.
More importantly, I think when we are talking about the economy, we are talking about a whole set of class relations.
The issue is that, in the course of such an analysis, we have to isolate, identify and underline the class relationships that underlie such an economy: how are the various social classes aligned in the way that they make possible the accumulation of capital, which is the primary concern of the capitalists.
In other words, to provide a criticism of political economy. Political economy is not about just production; it is about the class relations that underpin it.
Classes and strata to defend the program.
The second issue is that such a program has to quite clearly identify for us the classes that underpin this whole program of the revolutionary party.
In other words, a program cannot be an appeal to society in general.
We have to try and make clear who does this program speak to?
Which are the class forces that have got to be there to defend this program, that are going to go out on to the streets and fight for it, and if necessary, are going to put up the barricades to defend this particular program?
So our analysis must reveal these classes.
Now generally we say socialism is presumed to be in the interests of the working class.
Well that is true.
And it is important for the way that we conduct our struggle.
But at different moments in history, at different times and in different places, different sections of the working class, different strata within the middle classes, or within the peasantry, these different strata and sections, constitute almost what are advanced or leading sectors within a struggle for change.
What is important here is that while the proposition that the program rests on the working class as a whole is true, (which is of crucial importance because in the struggle it is in the interests of the class as a whole that concern us), in our analysis we need to see how the different strata within the working class are aligned;
and in what way can we therefore say what sections we expect to move in the direction of our program.
So we need to identify the social classes and the strata within the society that constitute the social basis of our programme.
Who then are the primary social forces that will defend this program, but also who will be other allies around this program?
Which are the other classes that we must speak to?
Must our program speak to the small producer?
Must our program speak to the small petty bourgeoisie?
Or does our program only speak to the worker, who is exploited in particular ways in the course of the production process?
Is there a peasantry in our country?
And does our program speak to the peasantry?
What about the attitudes of the intelligentsia?
In other words we must have an analysis of the totality of social classes, and of where our program is positioned relative to these social classes.
Is the bourgeoisie’s block breaking up.
Another thing, of course, is that a crisis is a shake-up in the relations of the entire society.
Now as socialists sometimes we tend not to pay a lot of attention to the bourgeoisie – except in terms of how its actions affect us negatively.
For questions of strategy, it is quite crucial that we begin to look a little more closely at how is the hegemonic block organized.
Who makes it up?
Who constitutes the ruling class?
The ruling class might be just the bourgeoisie proper.
Again we will find that when we talk about Mauritius, there is an understanding that given all the sections of the ruling class, the bourgeoisie proper, there are certain strata which are quite dominant in there i.e. within the bourgeoisie.
These ones determine its structure, political culture, even determine its habits, habits of how it responds to things, how it does things and in that sense, its political culture.
This gives us an understanding of the internal configuration of the bourgeoisie as a class, as well as the relationship it has with other sections of society.
The bourgeoisie never really rules alone.
It’s too small.
It’s too isolated to rule alone.
It normally rules in blocks of alliances with other classes.
Either Labour can make up one such block.
Organized Labour sometimes, in other countries, enters into an alliance, supports the party of the bourgeoisie.
Sometimes the peasantry, sometimes other different sections of society which do not belong to the bourgeoisie join its ruling block.
It is important that a program understands the way the ruling block is constituted, and the place of the bourgeoisie within that block.
Power relations that will need to change.
Now we will look briefly at the changes within the political power relations that are necessary for a program to be realized.
Sometimes there’s a call, “Let’s get together, let’s put a program together, a set of demands that we will draw up together,” but what we need to ask also is what assumptions are we making about the nature of the power relations that need to be changed in order for these demands to be realized.
Now trade unions, in many instances, for historical reasons, they sometimes suffer from the problem that they imagine that they can achieve demands without any changes in the power relations.
I know that South African trade unions get very aggrieved when their demands are ignored. Because their analysis does not try to look at what kinds of changes in power relations are necessary in order for their program to be realized.
Sometimes unions go into blocks and alliances without a clear understanding of what this is all about, and it tends, as someone has put it, to all end in tears.
Because you hit against this wall.
So, it is important to understand the changes necessary in power relations, implied by a program.
The practical measures must be discussed also: what practical measures are we talking about.
And lastly, this program must spell out a political strategy of mobilization.
Because an economic program becomes a shopping list, if it is not underwritten by a concept of how political mobilization is necessary to make it realizable.
The program must include the development of such a political strategy, and it must identify the forces that are going to move that strategy forward.
Without that, what we clearly have is not a program but a shopping list.
We find that within a lot of working class forces, like trade unions, they imagine that it is just enough to have a list of demands, without spelling out a strategy for their realization.
Now by way of illustration, I will just make one or two points, to update what we understand as important considerations in the way we develop, and discuss and refine our program.
I’ve taken these observations on the program to look at, although clearly much more discussion has already taken place in Lalit around statements in the program.
Showing the centrality of sugar and textiles.
The first thing, by way of example, is to open up discussion about the need for the program of the party or the movement to make clear the centrality and importance of sugar and textiles in Mauritius.
There are historical reasons for the position of sugar in the economy and so on.
The challenge, and what we need to demonstrate, is how they relate to other strata in society, and to demonstrate that the crisis of the sugar industry and textile industry constitutes a crisis of Mauritian society as a whole.
Now this is not always self-evident.
Especially in the light of the fact that bourgeois ideologues like to defend their project by saying, for example in South Africa, “Don’t be ridiculous, the textile sector has been under assault for the past 10 years.”
They say, “Our textile sector is just not competitive enough; we should move towards other competitive sectors, IT, we should do something or something else.”
It becomes imperative for us to demonstrate that the organic relationships within the Mauritian economy are of such a nature that the crisis of sugar and textiles is a crisis of the Mauritian economy.
It’s not a crisis of a part of the Mauritian economy; it is not because we want to deal with the special interests, and the special problems of a section of the working class. What we are observing, what we are looking at, is an unfolding generalized crisis.
Therefore an analysis of the position of these industries, and their interconnections with other industries becomes quite crucial, and needs to be made a much more visible part of our program.
Also what is crucial, is that equally from the side of the bourgeoisie in Mauritius, if the crisis of the sugar industry is the crisis of the rest of the bourgeoisie, then we can expect that we are dealing not with the responses of the sugar oligarchy or the textile bosses, but we are dealing with the responses of the entire bourgeoisie.
Now the crucial point about this here is that when the bourgeoisie responds to crisis, obviously each section responds in ways that are consistent with its own interests.
Now, in the main, the bourgeois parties are not in the habit of acting collectively.
It is in their own nature to act for their particular interests, unless they are forced by the development of the class struggle to act in the interests of other classes.
So this analysis becomes quite crucial; for instance, analysis of the bourgeoisie in its relationship to other classes with which it has ruled as a block.
Will the small planters stay in ruling block?
Now, it would be instructive to look at the evolution of Mauritian society and the sugar oligarchy.
An important political block that has reproduced the hegemony of the sugar bosses is the relationship the bourgeoisie has had with small planters: the small petty bourgeoisie in agriculture.
That is quite a crucial relationship, because it must now face the crisis of this industry.
The critical point in history was when the organizations of this stratum, this class of small planters, staked its claim on the sugar industry, and reached an accommodation with the sugar oligarchy.
This accommodation allowed the sugar oligarchy to continue exercising its hegemony in the post-independence period.
Now, this particular issue, therefore, needs to be developed in an understanding of the way the crisis unfolds.
The fundamental question we need to ask is whether the crisis is re-organizing the historical block, or whether the historical block will be left unchanged.
In other words, what will be the basis of the political hegemony of the sugar bosses in this country?
Up to now, it has exercised it through partnerships with the historical working class, through the Labour Party, which in the analysis of Lalit’s paper, was seen to have been taken over by the small planters.
Now that was a crucial political moment which allowed the production of a particular form of class rule in which the sugar bosses were able to extract all kinds of concessions that it did.
I think, just to tie up this section, many of us are aware that, as this crisis begins to make itself felt, there are already underfoot within the bourgeoisie attempts to preserve the hegemonic block under new conditions.
For example, we know that the State has started to act.
With the impending collapse of the sugar industry, it has already tried to put aside money, to lock the small planters into some ongoing relationship with the sugar barons particularly.
We can see here how the state is underwriting the infrastructure of the small producer in the face of the impending crisis - and I think that people in Mauritius have commented on the absurdities of this arrangement whereby the State is going to pay money to bring into cane cultivation more land, to de-rock these areas, and all other kinds of actions kind.
Now it is quite clear that, if you leave aside the immediate economic interest of certain sections of the people as you interpret their needs, it is quite clear that there is also an attempt here to preserve the hegemonic block in a particular way.
Whether they preserve it or not, is going to be a matter for history to tell, as the crisis unfolds.
But I think just as an illustration of how there are attempts to preserve this block, and for us, as a Left party, we need to understand and to analyze these attempts.
And of course with the intention of intervening in the way that block either fractures or is able to be maintained.
Restructuring of dominated classes under crisis.
And of course, equally important is an analysis of how is the crisis re-structuring the dominated classes.
The working class is not always “the” working class.
It does not always exist nor is it preserved in exactly the same form as it has been in the past.
It changes with changes in the development of capitalism.
It changes with the development of new sectors of production.
It changes as old sectors close, new sectors emerge.
And those sectors might not be organized or structured in a way that they used to be in the old sectors.
They might have fractured.
They might have a very different relationship to the bourgeoisie.
And therefore a concrete analysis of how the crisis is re-organizing the social weight of the different sections of the working class and the implications that this has for strategy, for the forms of organizing, for the kinds of traditional practices that we have inherited from past instances of struggle.
This is an important exercise for the party to undertake.
Party strategy & kinds of crises.
I would now like to talk about some of the considerations in the development of working class strategy, of the strategy of the political party in times of economic crisis.
I would like to begin by saying that it’s common sense - and it’s true and valid - that we think of the crisis as a “problem”.
And the crisis is a problem.
People have to struggle.
People have to face difficulties.
But from the view of the capitalist system as a whole it is not “a bad thing” or an “alien phenomenon”, so to speak.
It is important for us to understand that under capitalism, crisis also occupies a very different place.
For capitalism, crisis is also a way in which the system self-regulates.
It is the necessary “oil” that facilitates the working of the system.
It even cleanses the system of old or antiquated sectors, propels the development of new sectors and technologies.
Crisis, in the words of one historian of economic ideas, represents capitalism’s moment of “creative destruction”.
As Marx said, capitalism is a kind of anarchy.
All the various producers do not consult each other about how much they are going to produce, they do not consult each other about what they produce, when they will produce it, where they are planning to sell it to.
They don’t consult each other.
In other words, they plan their own production very carefully within their enterprise, through the most sophisticated planning systems.
And then, in society, these individual plans are integrated in an anarchic fashion.
In other words, you throw your shoes into the market, and then you wait and see what happens.
If you sell them fine, if not, bad luck and you go somewhere else.
Then you cut your losses, look for something else to do, or for another market.
Now, the point is that Capitalism, because of this anarchy, has to continually re-establish its balance.
And it does it through “crises”.
And therefore every so often, even in bourgeois economic literature it has now become accepted that crises are a normal part of capitalism.
And so in bourgeois economics, when you learn about economics, you learn about the business cycles which means basically an acceptance that it is in the very nature of the capitalist economy to have crises, to have these periodic breakdowns.
It is also important for us to appreciate these kinds of crises as a mode of self-regulation of the system, because it leads us to ask, as the first point of departure in planning our strategy, as to what kind of economic crisis are we looking at?
Is this particular crisis one of capitalism’s normal modes of self-reproduction?
Because these modes of self reproduction can be quite useful to it, in the sense that they can allow the closing down of an industry and the opening up of a new industry.
This can lead to a major shift in the allocation of labour forces within capitalism as different industrial sectors get reorganized to come out of the crisis period.
The question we are asking is, “Is this a crisis of self regulation”?
In other words, if I borrow from the way Gramsci described it, “Is this crisis conjunctural?”
Or is this crisis what Gramsci called “organic”?
In other words it’s got a much deeper historical character, and it goes far beyond the normal modes of self-reproduction of capitalism as a social system.
Conjunctural Crisis.
Gramsci distinguishes between these two forms of capitalist crisis: Conjunctural or Organic.
The conjunctural crisis gives rise to what he called day-to-day criticisms from people.
In other words, when these problems happen within society we see a focus of the criticism on the political leadership, on the personalities within the political leadership, you know in South Africa we would see this is a case of “mismanagement” of the economy.
In other words, the consciousness of the dominated classes discerns between a major crisis and this kind of crisis which is cyclical, leads to a minor realignment within the system, leads to what the bourgeois economists call “frictional unemployment”, when workers move from one sector and they are absorbed into another.
So, in such an instance the crisis is conjunctural. (This doesn’t mean that it might not be important.)
Now discerning between the two types of crisis is important for a political party.
The second kind of crisis is, of course, of a much more fundamental character.
Systemic Crises.
Systemic crises, also called “organic” crises, give rise to “socio-historical criticism” (Gramsci), whose subject is a wider social group, and goes beyond the public figures involved and the top leaders.
People will no longer say “It’s just Berenger who’s the problem, must replace him with Sithanen, or somebody else”.
They begin to discern that this is a much deeper systemic problem that is facing them.
They begin to realize that all the parties of the bourgeoisie have been unable to do anything.
They have been tested, tested over and over again.
People begin to see that it is the interest of the oligarchic groups that are at stake.
And that this group is just greedy.
They only look after themselves.
And the criticism begins to swing over from day-to-day problems, from day-to-day concerns with personalities, to a much more historical criticism.
Crises of that kind may last for extended durations, say, decades.
This is important when we are organizing on the grounds of an organic crisis; we need to gauge the tempo and the synchronization of that crisis.
The important issue is that the fairly extended period of the crisis can pass through periods of calm, where things appear to have been resolved, and then problems start up again.
But the fact that it is of exceptional duration means that incurable structural contradictions have revealed themselves, reached their maturity.
Here it is important for us to establish as a point of departure whether our analysis is suggesting that the crisis is of a conjunctural or more systemic kind.
This is because there is a whole range of implications for strategy.
Conjunctural or systemic?
Now, how will we establish if the crisis is conjunctural or systemic?
Firstly, for me, it is a question of dialectics, so to speak.
On the one hand, there is the mass work of the party, and this is quite fundamental.
On the other, theoretical work.
The party cannot establish, a priori, while sitting in a room having discussions that a crisis is systemic or isn’t - just through theoretical analysis or its critique of the political economy.
Nor can it do so by only doing mass work.
Of course, even there, there is another dialectic - of the party’s own interaction with the masses.
The party doesn’t just act like political scientists do, read up, and then go home to supper.
The party does mass work.
In its mass work, it promotes perspectives of the world; it helps promote the ideology of socialism, discerns the immediate interests of the working class, and imposes on the agenda for debate the kinds of issues that the earlier sessions spoke about.
On the one hand we have dealt with the important element of establishing and confirming the validity of our analysis that the crisis is deeper than usual, that people feel it is deeper than usual.
We need to validate this.
On the other hand, of course, the party has inherited a whole period of work and a whole set of tools of analysis, with which to analyze the evolution of social classes in society, and the place of different industries within that society, and the importance of the fractures taking place in the sugar industry, and the processes going on in tourism.
That analysis is then brought together with this process of mass work, and this abstracting of the interpretive diagnosis going on within the working class. In this way the party, through this historical process of testing, is able to establish the peculiar character of the crisis.
It is on these grounds that it will design its strategies in the long run.
It goes without saying that once an organic crisis begins to unfold, its form of existence is a series of conjunctural crises.
Lets take an example.
I think in South Africa, from our own experience, South African society, in general, experienced a very profound historical crisis, which first broke out visibly at the end of the 1960’s.
It found its expression most strongly in two major strike waves.
One in Namibia, where there was a major strike (1971), the other in South Africa the Durban strikes (1973).
Another major rupture was that of 1976 (Soweto students’ uprising); we went on to a major crisis in 1980-83, and further on to another one in 1985, which was followed by a chain of other crises in the “Homelands” at the tail end of the 1980s, at the beginning of the 1990’s.
This was a sign of a cycle of sustained crisis in the social structure.
When therefore one says that the crisis can extend for decades, this is not an exaggeration.
The important point is, when the crisis that we characterize as an organic crisis begins, it leads to a chain of conjunctural crises.
It is not just one long crisis.
It goes from one upsurge to a time of calm, to another upsurge and another crisis, as the different social classes are taking stock of their different solutions in the upturns, and especially in times of calm.
One can then observe the very deep dialectic between the organic crisis and its waves of conjunctural crises.
And the important point again is that the role of the party is to keep in the minds of the working class the continuity of the crisis.
Because every time the ruling class will present it as a new set of “disturbances”, or another act of violence or another example of unrest or some new agitators.
So the importance of the party is that throughout, through its insight and experience, it is able to keep an understanding of the continuity of those sources of “unrest”.
The party has the role of pointing to the fact that all these different problems are pointing to a crisis, to an organic crisis.
I think on the grounds of this unfolding of the organic crisis, two key things can, or need to be done.
Shifts in centre of struggle.
The first one, an important task for the party, is to analyze, and to work closely with the masses, and to be able to discern any shift in the general composition of the revolutionary forces.
A South African example: In the 30-35 year period, an interesting feature of that period was the way that the centre or epicentre of the revolutionary outbreaks kept shifting from one part of the working class to another one.
In the very beginning you have as front-runners, the university students.
At that time, the revolutionary forces were exhausted, were defeated, there was fear in the country, then you have the first outbreak of popular dissent against apartheid amongst the university students.
You saw the formation of the South African Students’ Organisation (SASO) as one of the important landmarks, the student's organisation, which organised in the tertiary institutions.
The next important event represents a major shift in centre of gravity to the factories.
The 1973 strikes, which changed everything completely.
The strikes reversed almost a decade and a half of repression against the trade union movement.
Suddenly, workers were bold enough to organise their own unions, and to strike.
About 100,000 workers come out in Durban and this lead to the birth of many of the modern trade unions.
That was the second kind of shift, to a second stratum.
The next wave broke out in education, but not in the tertiary institutions which was the case in the first wave, but in schools, in 1976.
What we saw, and this is instructive, is the shift in the centres of gravity within the working class - the working class was not just one block.
It is important, both from the point of view of analysis and obviously from the point of view of the positioning of the party itself, in the context of the unfolding crisis, to keep a close eye on these shifts as they develop.
The important lesson from South Africa about this is that first of all there were groups on the Left that, through a theoretical schema, decreed the primacy of the industrial working class.
So every time these waves broke outside of the industrial proletariat, they were unable therefore to be in contact with the revolutionary parts of the working class, and to inform other classes, and to keep the historical continuity of the change in the tide of the revolution.
The important lesson is that one cannot decree in advance which section of the working class will come into action.
Now, it can be the case that the immediate attack by the bourgeoisie takes place in the sugar industry, but that may not tell us that the first wave of opposition will emerge in that sector. Our ability to establish where that next wave breaks is a test of the party’s capacity. But the party cannot decree.
The second issue of course is the party’s own penetration into the working class, in its various strata.
Another point is an analysis of the internal structure of the working class, and how that is being changed as the organic economic crisis unfolds in time.
It is important so that the party isn’t always playing catch-up.
I don’t think the party can ever catch up with the working class; in upturns, the working class is always that much faster.
And the important point is that, if you do get left behind, don’t get paralyzed.
Try and keep close enough to the working class to be able to catch up.
Historical ruling block.
A similar kind of analysis and interaction needs to take place concerning the way a crisis is re-organizing the ruling block.
I want to spend some time on this.
At certain times, in the evolution of the crisis, we find that certain elements of the historical bloc, in order to resolve their own disagreements within the block, begin to organize outside the ruling block.
Normally you could have an apparently very quiet historical period, a lull within this long-term organic crisis, and then suddenly a fight begins to break out, which then exposes a very soft under-belly to the crisis.
Old thieves, as they say, are falling out.
In their attempt to shore up their own positions, they begin to organize outside.
So crises are not only triggered because the working class is under pressure, but the crises are sometimes triggered by re-organization of the ruling block.
The crisis’ vigour and tempo can also be determined by the internal re-organization of the ruling block.
Especially, as I said, when a section of the ruling block attempts to organize outside the ruling block; for example, when we discussed how the Labour Party got captured in a sense by the planters in the 1950s.
But the important thing about the problem is that the planters, through the Labour Party, had to reach a new historical accommodation with the sugar oligarchy, so that these classes could continue to act together, under a new balance of forces within the ruling block.
It happens sometimes that these parts of the block can’t identify together anymore.
As I think, when we get nearer 2009, when the whole issue of the money for sugar comes up.
When the crunch of the crisis comes up, we might find that the traditional parties of the ruling block are not able to contain the contradictions within that block.
And in those moments you find out that the structure of these parties, of one of the parties within that block, requires support, and therefore it begins to fish outside the usual support for the ruling block, and look for possible allies in the re-organization of the ruling block.
Now, it’s crucial for the revolutionary party to be sensitive to these movements between the ruling classes, without of course accommodating itself to them.
As we see in South Africa at the moment, what the Zuma affair really comes down to is the fact that the structure within the ruling block (of ANC-SACP-COSATU) finds labour wanting to latch on to one part of that block, as a way of resolving its own crisis.
And now the crucial political character of the party comes in.
Its implantation in the mass, the nature of its program, both prevent it from just becoming attached as a support to one or other elements of the ruling classes.
It is quite important that the party of the working class is able to anticipate, and understand and intervene decisively in the political debate within the society, a debate that is unleashed by these conflicts in the ruling class, and to have the structures in its own party that permit this debate.
So in terms of strategy, the question of how this structure in the party enables debate becomes an important part of the strategy.
Tempo of the crisis.
Now, there are two last things I would like to talk about, before coming to my concluding remarks.
In the development of the strategy of the Revolutionary Party, there are 2 issues, which become quite important especially when there’s a crisis of an extended character, and society goes through this chain of struggles.
The first one has to do with the issue of the tempo of the crisis.
I will talk about that very shortly.
The second one is what I call the problems of synchronization of the crisis.
The crisis is not always moving in step.
I think we can see sometimes how these issues play themselves out in the course of actual history.
Firstly, let us talk about the tempo of the crisis.
One is obviously talking here about the pace at which the crisis unfolds.
It appears that in periods of organic crisis, you have both periods of very slow development of the crisis and of swift movement.
The crisis can sometimes develop a step at a time, when there are no major breakouts of any major struggles, and there’s a bit of defensive action in this or that corner.
Again this slow tempo can punctuate a period of upsurges.
The period in South Africa from the 1960s to the early 90’s is filled up with alternating tempos in the class struggle.
Periods where there was very little organizing taking place, the revolutionary forces are exhausted, they are retired, and suddenly periods of enormous acceleration in the class struggle when just about everyone is prepared to join an organization.
No one is scared of the police.
Everyone wants to put a barricade in the street.
That goes on for months, and then suddenly they go back again to normal life.
These tempos alternate.
So, the issue of the tempo is, of course, important to us because the whole range of different tactics is appropriate to each period characterized by a different tempo of struggle.
The working class reacts differently in the different phases.
Sometimes it will take you months to try to explain a certain demand, and then suddenly the working class will understand directly.
“This is all old stuff,” they will tell you, “We know that already! We are looking for more new things.”
We find again that sometimes it takes years of organizing in schools and universities, and suddenly there’s a spark and we find that we cannot keep up – with the demands for literature, demands for speakers, and so on.
So we see that new ways of learning, new ways of doing politics correspond to different phases of the struggle.
And I think again, importantly, and this again makes the party crucial, is that from one successive wave in this alternating tempo to the next, there are important changes in the psychology of the working class.
The working class creates new organizations and they begin then to sustain them.
So these are never the same.
And I think there are important debates and discussions in the history of revolutionary strategy.
And with the Russians again, to whom we owe so much, though they are impoverished nowadays, there was a whole debate on what we call the theory of the “offensive”.
We see a whole group within the party, which kind of believes that once the first wave of the crisis breaks out, it’s a one-way street now, and the party is on the offensive all the time.
And I think there is the need for a lot of debate about the fact that the crisis is extended, and that the existence of a crisis does not always imply that the working class is ready everyday to have a march in the streets.
In fact you might have to go back to much slower tempos of political work within and between the waves in the struggle.
That was also important in the civil war period in Russia as well, with the White Army, and so on, because the theory of the “offensive” was transferred from the theory of the offensive in revolution into the civil war.
It also became important and was unfortunately the source of many defeats in Europe in the 1930’s where the working class was ordered, when this group dominated the Comintern, to be on the offensive against the bourgeoisie., and told that this is the last fight against the bourgeoisie, and will be an all out fight.
So this indicates the importance of the dialectics in the kind of interchange in tempo in the class struggle.
I think I will talk briefly about the second problem, that is, the problem of synchronization, in the development of the class struggle.
Now it is also an interesting and very difficult problem for the parties of the working class.
And when comrades discuss this, we think it found its sharpest expression in the “July Days” in Petrograd in the Russian Revolution.
Now what are the important issues?
What are the problems?
In a period of an extended struggle, one that goes on for decades, or even for months, in a very intensive period, we get all the problems of tempo and so on.
But there is another problem, which is very systemically rooted in the very nature of the working class, - which is that the working class’s different sectors and different strata experience capitalism and the crisis differently.
And they sometimes have very different traditions of organizing; they have different strengths, and different psyches of combativity.
Some will take to the streets, as they are always “hot-headed”, they’re always ready to fight; at any suggestions of the bourgeoisie that they are going to temper with their rights, they take to the streets immediately.
Others are much slower and take much longer.
And what this produces then, as the crisis unfolds, is the difficulty of synchronization between these different sections we are talking about.
What is important for this synchronization to occur?
Sometimes, it is one section of the working class taking a solo attempt on the ruling class and staffing the barricades alone.
And they get mowed down, one by one, and this is where demoralization translates to the other sectors.
In the historical problematic, I mentioned the July Days, it became quite a major issue because comrades realized that the future of the revolution was at risk.
Because the more militant sectors in Petrograd wanted to go and take power, and the peasantry was not prepared, other sections were not interested, and the danger emerged that the more militant sections would be able to be mowed down in isolation from the other sections.
A kind of the repeat of the experience of the Parisian working class in 1871 where it rose up in isolation from other social classes, because there were no other social forces that were able to take part in the revolution at that time.
So now again, when we talk of the different considerations of strategy, the issue here is what is the authority of the party in being able to facilitate an almost approximate kind of synchronization?
This is what counts.
Theoretically or otherwise, even with a party’s growing, deepening authority within the working class, it is not an easy task.
The party often has to struggle hard to hold the working class, to hold back those who want to act too fast alone, to keep the working class together.
Another issue is how do we respond when these different sections of the working class take these solo attempts?
And what does this say about the capacity of the party to emerge with prestige.
The difficulty is, at the time, do you say, “Ah, we have got nothing to do with it! We told you not to do this now! You won’t listen!” and then leave them to their devices?
Or do we deal with the problem as they dealt with it in July in Russia, working out to what extent we march with them, even as they head to extreme instances of defeat that they can suffer?
So to come to some of the most important issues of political debate: What do you do when there is a riot?
Do you stop them?
Join them in the streets?
This is the historical problematic that we have to deal with in this context.
Concluding Remarks: The final Crisis?
The final thing I want to talk about is this: Is there such a thing as the final and catastrophic crisis, one out of which the bourgeoisie can never emerge?
Lenin said that there are no absolutely hopeless situations from which the bourgeoisie cannot emerge.
The bourgeoisie is exceptionally resourceful.
It has deep reserves in the whole international block that looks after it, that is entrusted with its welfare.
There is also the fact that it is the one class that has access to the largest part of permanently available resources, and to ideologues who are defending its attitudes and its ideology, defending the system until the last.
And I think it is important, as we enter a period of crisis, that we do not repeat the mistakes of some of us in the struggle in South Africa, who said Apartheid cannot end without the end of capitalism.
We found out that it can.
We can say that there is still racism, but objectively the idea that it was impossible to conceive of capitalism in South Africa without the juridical form of Apartheid was obviously, with hindsight, quite wrong.
Therefore my last point is that there are no final crises.
It’s all conditional on the conduct of the revolutionary forces, whether they can solve the issue in their own interest, in the interests of the classes they represent, or whether the issue again gets resolved in the interests of the bourgeoisie.
Or, a third option, which I think Marx and Gramsci talked about, which is the “peace of the graveyard”.
In other words those classes in the battle are so exhausted that the whole thing disintegrates.
And sometimes we get a strong man emerging to stitch up everyone.
The rise of the strong man, in a reactionary storm of fascism.
We need to think big.
The Mauritian economy is in big enough trouble to warrant it.
For 200 years the Mauritian private sector bosses have been in charge of the economy.
They have kept a tight monopoly control on big capital.
They have taken all major decisions as to when to invest in what and how much to invest in it.
They have kept a tight control on investment in what they refer to as “labour”, meaning one of the inputs into production.
So, it has been the private sector bosses who have decided how to create jobs, in what sectors and under what conditions.
This same capitalist class has kept a monopoly control over most of the land, deciding all by themselves what to plant and how to organize production.
So it is that the bosses take all the decisions about how to feed us.
In the past 10 years, this monopoly situation has, if anything, deteriorated.
When the rate of return to private investment has started, as usual, to go down, the private bourgeoisie has sent its tentacles out into the public sector.
It has taken over control of Mauritius Telecom, which was a department of Government.
It is trying to get control of CEB and CWA, thus adding electricity and water to its list.
It is bent on controlling pension funds, and has already started investing in health and education.
It has gone deeply into muck-collection.
It has even gone into policing.
Government after government has perpetuated this state of affairs.
From colonial times through the Labour Government of the 1960’s and 1970’s, up until the MMM and MSM Governments during the 1980’s and 1990’s, and until today, all Governments have organized everything so that the bosses continue their rule, continue taking decisions off their own bats.
At most, the government has sometimes intervened so as to ensure a bit of extra profit from cane and sugar for the bosses.
For example, government has organized pre-payments to small planters for their cane.
It has set up the factory area system, to share planters out amongst mills.
And it is governments who negotiate sugar prices with European governments and the EU.
And whenever workers have risen up in rebellion against the bosses and the Government, then and only then has the Government seen fit to intervene; the colonial Government introduced the first old-age pensions and the Village Election system after the rebellions of 1937 and 1943; then around the mobilization for Independence, it introduced permanent employment on sugar estates from 1964; and nationalized one sugar Estate, Rosebelle, and the CEB; new labour laws and the system of Awards were introduced; under pressure Government forced the bosses to recognize the sugar sector trade unions SILU and UASI after the August 79 general strike; laws were introduced to prohibit the estates from having their own shops for their workers, and later forced the estates to close down the system of tied housing.
But, it is still the bosses that continue to take all decisions of importance for the entire people and our survival on the planet. And they do it single-handed. They continue their monopoly on land control, on capital, and on decisions about how to deploy “labour” and what jobs to create or not.
And now today, the bosses and the Government have come forward to begin to admit that their project is a failure.
The sugar industry is already in a deep crisis.
And for the three next years, this same crisis will deepen further into a cataclysm.
The “Sugar Protocol” under the Lome Convention has reached its limit.
So, the crisis is, in some ways, “the chronicle of an anticipated crisis”.
Everyone with any nouse knew the crisis was coming.
But those who take decisions persisted in doing absolutely nothing to prevent it, avoid it, or transcend it.
The Government has allowed mill after sugar mill to close down, with more and more job-losses leaving the countryside without any serious employment prospects at all.
We suppose the MCB and other banks just went and announced bad debts of Rs 800,000,000 for each economic disaster.
The free zone textile industry is also at the beginning of an absolutely major crisis.
Many factories have already shut down.
The Multi-fibre agreement ends now, in January 2005, making this crisis yet another “chronicle of an expected crisis”.
This kind of export processing zone was doomed from its very inception to be a non-sustainable type of so-called “development”. It was always a “stop-gap”.
Now, all the profits produced by 30 years of workers’ sweat and tears, flies off to be invested elsewhere, leaving no profound traces of economic development in Mauritius.
When the first place the textile bosses ran to was Madagascar, they bumped into a major political crisis, and there too, lost everything.
Over the past 30 years, productivity of labour has increased 50-fold.
Agricultural production has been helped by mechanization, and the mills and textile factories have been helped by centralization and the introduction of electronic machinery.
So, how on earth, at times like this can the Government and bosses have the cheek to come and announce that “unfortunately” old age pensions as a right are no longer affordable?
How can they announce that Government can no longer afford to pay 1/2 the SC and HSC examination fees as of right?
That certain hospital services may need to be paid for by the patient at the moment of the service?
Paul Berenger and Pravind Jugnauth have even set about destroying agricultural land now.
Instead of building a Cyber-City on rocky land somewhere, they spread concrete all over the finest land in the country at Ebene.
So long as the sugar estate bosses get lots and lots of money for selling their land.
Instead of developing agriculture and industry to assure food security and food for export, they go ahead with a slave-minded plan to attract the millionaires of the planet to come and build big villas here, thus reducing Mauritian citizens to being virtual servants on a permanent basis.
What kind of bankruptcy are they admitting to for their very own development strategies?
It is an important moment to think about political economics.
In fact, it is already late.
Berenger, Ramgoolam and Jugnauth, all of them have contributed to bringing us to the brink of a grave economic crisis, one on a scale never known in the history of the country prior to this.
And it is not just Lalit that says so. The bosses and Government have finally come around to agreeing that that is the case. The sugar industry has no future. Free Zone-style development has none either. There will be further mass sackings with new VRS (the so-called Voluntary Retirement Schemes that are all but compulsory) and with further mill closures. Unemployment can be expected to continue to rise. Recently Prime Minister Berenger was so het-up about the rate of unemployment that he took to blaming the Central Statistical Office for it, accusing them of not calculating accurately.
It is in such a context that Lalit is launching this campaign on a national level to force the Government and the bosses and their lackey-ideologues to open their eyes and look at what the future holds for all the humans of this land.
It’s in this context of generalized flux that Lalit has begun a national campaign to force Government and the bosses, and their accredited ideologues, to wake up and act in the interests of the people of this country.
A KEY MOMENT IN HISTORY.
As long ago as in 1983-84, Lalit was already in the middle of a campaign to warn of the dangers of leaving the Sugar Oligarchs to dictate agricultural politics of the whole country. What happened then, was that we bumped into State repression.
We had prepared a Slide Show and Talk Series called “Disik, Ki Lavenir?” that was touring towns and villages of Mauritius.
We were, even then, proposing a legal framework that would oblige the Sugar Estates to plant their rows of cane in a format that allows inter-line cropping of food crops every year, and not just when there is new cane planted every seven or so years.
In our campaign against ‘fermtir sovaz’ of Sugar Mills, which had only just begun, we were, even then, envisaging forcing the Oligarchs to convert all mills closing down into agro-industries of modern types (canning, freeze-drying, freezing, transformation into juices, soups, etc).
SLAVERY, INDENTURE, WAGE SLAVERY AND THE NEED FOR AGRARIAN REFORM.
STRUCTURAL CRISIS IN THE SUGAR INDUSTRY.
The sugar industry has gone into a crisis so deep that it cannot be alleviated by the depreciation of the rupee, nor even by a devaluation.
The measures the Government and bosses are proposing now will not have any really positive affect, and this neither in the short nor long term.
This kind of crisis has dangerous social repercussions in addition to the obvious economic effects.
Even when there are tourist hotels and free zone factories in the countryside in Mauritius, it is still, until today, life around the sugar mill and cane plantation that provides the social cohesion of village life.
The crisis in the sugar industry today is a direct and predictable result of the introduction of WTO rules and of the restructuring of agriculture in a European Union, which is growing in size all the time.
The protectionist regime under which the sugar industry grew and survived in colonial times, is now being dismantled really fast: there will no longer be the same quotas and guaranteed prices that ex-colonies like Mauritius have had when they produce for and export to Europe.
THE BACKGROUND TO THE CRISIS.
We all know about the times of the  “sugar boom” in the mid 1970’s which quickly became the economic crisis of the late 1970’s, when the revenue from sugar was no longer enough to assure the cost of imports of basic needs, and when there were two devaluations which aimed at making workers and ordinary people bear the brunt of the crisis.
Instead of thinking about what long-term future the sugar industry really had, the ruling classes just went into textiles and tourism, while gradually giving more and more tax concessions to the sugar bosses, mainly reducing the Sugar Export Levy.
We all remember the notorious 57 million rupee “tax relief” that the first MMM-PSM Government introduced.
Instead of diversifying agriculture so as to assure food security and to increase the productivity of agricultural land, the sugar companies went on planting cane and investing in textiles and tourism for the short-term profits these offered them.
Later these companies would take the surplus made by Mauritian workers and go and invest in other countries, where often they lost all that social capital.
In the 1980’s, the export levy on sugar was further reduced, until it disappeared altogether.
At the same time mill concentration and mechanization of the fields went ahead full steam, supposedly to lower production costs.
But once again it was just that the working class was being made to bear the brunt of the crisis, because jobs themselves (not just individual workers’ salaries) were being lost ever.
Already, the price sugar was bringing was not increasing in real terms, nor in comparison with increases in the price of imports.
But the sugar industry went on surviving because of the protectionism that Europe offered through the Sugar Protocol.
Under the present MMM-MSM Government all this has accelerated further: rapid mechanization of planting and harvesting has brought the VRS, which destroyed some 10,000 labourers’ jobs; a mill on average has closed each year, with a reduction in mill workers’ jobs; piece rate “speed-ups” for labourers and mill workers continue, while the salaries and bonuses of the management remain a secret; the IRS (Integrated Resorts Scheme) projects are converting thousands of arpents of good agricultural land into holiday camps for millionaires from abroad.
All these measures aim at nothing else but floating the profits of the sugar estates, without the least regard for the futures of the 30,000 to 40,000 small cane planters, let alone the workers.
But, as early as 1995, with the setting up of the WTO and all its new trade rules, it had become clear that the subsidies that the beet-producers of Europe as well as the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) countries got, would be bound to become illegal.
That is precisely what is happening today. Under pressure from countries that produce sugar for the world market and earn about one-third of what the producers for Europe earn, countries like Australia, Brazil, and Thailand, the WTO has declared the subsidies on beet sugar “illegal” under WTO rules, because Europe sells some of this very sugar on the world market, thus helping depress its price further.
Another factor that has accelerated this process is the fact that Europe has grown from 15 to 25 members now, and has to decrease its agricultural subsidies, especially as many of the new members are agricultural producers.
So when the European Commissioners come and propose a reduction of 37% in the sugar price they will guarantee over the next 2 years all we can say is that such a proposal was eminently predictable.
And all the measures in the world to assure short-term profitability for the sugar estates will not suffice to rectify that scale of price reduction.
For small planters, this scale of price fall will be a veritable catastrophe.
WHAT ARE WE PROPOSING?
Already the rupee is depreciating rapidly relative to the Euro and the Pound Sterling and this is bringing inflation;
is the Government feeling tempted to precipitate a devaluation so as to increase the sugar revenue in rupee terms to absorb the price reduction?
At the moment, Government is putting all its efforts into “diplomacy”, to try to put off or decrease the amplitude of the price reduction that Europe has already announced, and to negotiate some sort of temporary “compensation”;
they are also working on a new speeded up “re-structuring” plan. This will mean more of the deadly job destruction of VRS and mill closure.
Until almost all employment in the sugar industry will be seasonal and casual, with lower wage rates than at present.
No doubt the Sugar Syndicate (The bosses organization in charge of the sale of sugar in general) will demand a price increase for sugar sold in shops in Mauritius. But this will be difficult because the shop-keepers will be able to import sugar cheaper from the world market and sell it at the same price as it is now.
The long-term proposal to use molasses to make ethanol for energy production to replace some of the imported petroleum products is also problematic under WTO-type logic. Will Mauritius be able to produce it cheaper than it can be bought from other big producers like Brazil?
QUESTIONING THE BASICS.
Has the time not come to put into question why we grow cane and make sugar?
Is it not time to start thinking instead about if we are using our agricultural land and our climate in an optimal way when we persist with this cane and sugar?
Is it not time to consider other agricultural and agro-industrial production that creates jobs, for now and for future generations?
There is no doubt that unemployment has already become the most urgent and most basic question in the country: it is not possible to go on looking at the sugar industry without considering diversification and new agro-industries which have potential for job-creation.
But before looking into agricultural diversification in more detail, let us look at what kind of institutional “backing” it is that has kept everyone believing that sugar is the best thing, when it is only (and maybe that too is not true) good for the “sugar oligarchy” as a class.
GOVERNMENTAL BACKING FOR THE SUGAR INDUSTRY IN MAURITIUS.
For decades the sugar industry has benefited from an array of supports, set up from before Independence and on until the present.
This support is what gives the appearance that sugar and cane are “the best thing” for “Mauritius” to be investing in.
In 1951 under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, the sugar industry benefited from a guaranteed market for sugar.
This agreement was included into the “Sugar Protocol” under the LOME Convention in 1974 when Britain Jointed the European Economic Community.
The Mauritian sugar bosses thus remained couched in the “comfort” of a guaranteed market, and were not interested much in agricultural diversification or in food production.
The sugar industry bosses thus continued pocketing their short-term profits year after year. Plus they benefited from all sorts of State aid, mainly through a series of institutions and fiscal concessions.
The “bureaucracies” and political nominees at the head of all these institutions, in turn, for their own “comfort” developed a kind of vested interest in the continuation of the Sugar Oligarchs’ profits.
This means that these very bureaucracies and political nominees have always been colluding with the bosses and government in attacking jobs and in threatening the future of the people of the country, as a whole.
THE INSTITUTIONS AND CONCESSIONS SET UP BEFORE AND AFTER INDEPENDENCE.
1853  Mauritius Chamber of Agriculture.
1919  Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, which got a new status in 1951.

It was this institutional support, arbitrarily handed out by Governments and regimes, one after the other, to pump up sugar profits, that has been a brake on the kind of agricultural diversification that would have averted the present crisis.
HISTORY OF THE DEBATE ON AGRICULTURAL DIVERSIFICATION.
In the history os Mauritius, there have been numerous attempts to put the question of agricultural diversification on the agenda.
During the 2nd World War, the Colonial Government took a number of measures to assure food crops, so as to assure food security, since shipping was interrupted.
In 1944 the Colonial State had a Land Resettlement Scheme (a kind of land reform plan) to allow small planters access to land for food crops.
But the capitalists who controlled most of the land and who were attached to sugar production did not agree and forced the State to abandon this plan very quickly.
THE MEADE REPORT: AN ENLIGHTENED REPORT IN FAVOUR OF AGRICULTURAL DIVERSIFICATION.
Before Independence, the State appointed Prof. Meade to study the economic and social structure of Mauritius.
His report, published in 1961, outlined the danger of a mono-crop economy based on cane and sugar.
He explained how this kind of economy would not be viable in the long term. He said that if ever the sugar quotas were called into question, this would have a very serious effect on the whole country’s economy.
He referred to existing studies that showed that the land and climate in Mauritius suggested many other forms of agriculture than cane and sugar.
He proposed that the State should discourage and limit sugar production and encourage diversification.
Among the measures he proposed was the Export Levy on sugar.
To encourage diversification he proposed institutions like what would later become the Marketing Board.
WHY NO DIVERSIFICATION THEN?
The historical bourgeoisie, which owns and controls most of the land and especially most of the prime agricultural land did not agree to diversify.
They were too attached to their sugar.
But they were not the only ones with a vested interest.
Towards the end of the 19th Century, there was a change when the estates got together to form companies and began the process of modernization and centralization.
This increased their output so fast that they became “hungry” for cane. This means the estates had a vested interest in small planters supplying cane to keep their mills running.
The increase in the number of small planters also meant that the estates gained a “reserve army” for the cane cutting season.
At the end of the 19th Century there thus came the time of “parcellization” when estate sold marginal land to planters who would provide them with cane, in return.
The production of vegetables would thus fall considerably.
From 1900 the number of planters continued to grow.
Planters thus developed a vested interest in the sugar industry.
The working class had its interest elsewhere. Agricultural diversification was in its interests.
This would keep employment stable, and bring food security. This would have created the basis, in turn, for the development of a modern economy.
The workers in the years 1930-40 were organized in unions, and also politically in the Labour Party and the Bissoondoyalist movement.
But the colonial State used repression systematically against workers.
On the other hand, the associations of small planters became stronger and developed a political voice through the Advance Group, a team led by SS Ramgoolam, who stood against the Labour Party in the 1948 elections, and would later actually “take over” the Labour Party.
Advance represented the voice of a petty-bourgeoisie in trade, planting and in the professions, whose rise was blocked by the alliance between the sugar oligarchs and the colonial State.
This group also wanted to accumulate capital.
As, from about 1950 the Labour Party in fact represented the planters who were partly in conflict with the Estates but who also had an interest in the continued production of sugar.
All this helps explain who even after Labour was in power, even after Independence, there was no political will to reform land nor to diversify agriculture.
A section of Labour’s base was dependant on sugar production, which was dependent on the Estates.
DEBATE ON AGRICULTURAL DIVERSIFICATION AFTER INDEPENDENCE.
After Independence, the working class re-organized: the MMM, between 1969 and 1982, became its political voice.
The first political programs of the MMM put a lot of emphasis on the need for land reform, on nationalization of the estates and on the need for diversification (Pour une Ile Maurice possible 1970, Socialisme et Developpement 1971).
The MMM’s governmental program for the 1976 General Elections still put emphasis on job creation through diversification and industry, and on the development of marine resources and the need to nationalize 5 estates and 20,000 arpents of land for the purposes of this diversification.
DEBATE FALTERS ON SELF-RELIANCE.
Early in 1979, a group in the MMM called LEL GOS (Madan Dulloo, Jack Bizlall, Habib Mosaheb, Rama Poonoosamy, Rajiv Servansing, the late Siven Chinien) brought out a program for self-reliance.
They said it was an economic strategy based on local resources.
They did not intend reducing sugar production, but thought it needed to be limited.
They sought an alliance for the working class with a section of the capitalist class (against the imperialists) for their plan for a “national reconstruction” project.
Mauritius was to produce food for its own needs, and at the very most develop a common market for the Mascarene zone.
Their project was not convincing because it persisted in seeing agricultural diversification only in terms of national production, separate from the rest of the world.
This kind of “isolationism” was not on, and at the time Lalit criticized their plans, as nationalist in the extreme.
Mr. Michel de Speville, director of Food & Allied, pleaded publicly for diversification in order to assure food security, to assure foreign exchange, and to decrease imports, keep inflation down and get more value-added.
He also warned of the possible end to the Sugar Protocol under the Lome Convention, and said that war could also isolate Mauritius and leave us without our food imports.
He called on the State to encourage food production, agricultural diversification through subsidies, marketing, and to tax imports.
He estimated that 13,500 arpents of land would suffice for self-reliance in food.
The MMM leadership quickly picked up on the class collaboration involved in the Lel Gos line, and announced that there were indeed “Patron du progres”.
The MMM made “self-reliance” its reason for land reform.
In Lalit we have a different philosophy. We believe it is necessary to develop diversified agriculture and agro-industry not just for “self reliance” but as part of an export strategy as well.
At the time, in Lalit de Klas we criticized the concept of “self-reliance” as one that was back-ward looking.
In historical terms what happened was that, because the “self-reliance” project was not viable, and it took centre-stage in debates, the debates on agricultural diversification came a cropper.
Soon the MMM abandoned the concept of self-reliance and by the time they came to power in 1982 they were already the best defenders of the sugar oligarchy that the oligarchs had ever had.
AFTER 1982.
Lalit has always worked for land reform, for agricultural diversification and for the development of a modern agro-industry.
Since 1982, Lalit is really the only political force to have systematically warned against the kind of economic strategy based on sugar, free zone and tourism.
Today we are being proven right.
AGRICULTURE, SCIENTIFIC BREEDING, PRESERVING FOOD.
In Mauritius, work in the agricultural sector has always been associated with hard and heavy labour due to the semi-feudal working conditions, which characterize labourers work on the sugar estates.
In fact, the economic policy applied by different governments has perpetuated this situation.
Working conditions in the agricultural sector stayed archaic compared to other sectors.
It is not surprising to find much more work accidents in this sector.
This has greatly contributed to discouraging people from working in agriculture.
Alternative agriculture does not only mean a “return to the soil” in a romantic fashion as was promoted by people like Rousseau in Europe long ago.
In our modern times it will be agriculture based on scientific methods of cultivation and breeding, built on existing traditional knowledge, and for the amelioration of working conditions and production.
It will also mean the integration of the preserving of agricultural products into the sector.
Nowadays satellite photos are being used in some European countries for an assessment of the better use that land can be put to.
This technology is even used on tractors.
But technology and science does not necessarily mean better working conditions: it depends on who has the economic power and on, what social class has control over the economy.
Therefore all new forms of agriculture must include the question of how to bring more democracy to the workplace, how to establish democratic control and free circulation of knowledge on agriculture, how scientific progress can bring about the welfare of every human being and the protection of the environment from pollution.
KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE.
In Mauritius some people already have a profound knowledge about farming, including cow-keeping, other animal rearing and planting all sorts of food crops.
But the government has consistently attacked small scale agricultural production, especially compared with sugar production.
To give just a few examples. In Montagne Ory, for example, chicken rearing by people in the locality has decreased because sanitary inspectors have forbidden shops to stock chicken feed.
This reminds us of how dholl puri sellers were driven away from Port-Louis by the authorities at the exact time when MacDonalds was opening its fast food there.
There is a political will on the part of the government to destroy all that is traditional, and they tend to turn to the new WTO-style phyto-sanitary controls as their main pretext.
They want to destroy all sectors that they qualify as “inefficient”.
Instead of developing the will to modernize and rationalize this traditional form of agriculture, the MMM-MSM governments economic policy relies on slogans like “bio-technology”, which, in the way they intend to use it, will in fact bring about the destruction of this sector.
Pravind Jugnauth’s positions on traditional methods of cultivation, when the law on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) was being passed in Parliament clearly demonstrates this.
They want to “eliminate” small planters, for example, and thus risk losing all the already-acquired knowledge possessed by them and passed from generation to generation, sustaining humans on the planet.
Their political will, as far as we can decode it, is to destroy the knowledge on the preservation of seeds, and the transmission of seeds “free”, so as to replace this system by the system of seeds produced by Monsanto and sold in cans.
In fact Monsanto seeds have the feature very often of being “terminator”.
This in turn endangers (through cross-pollination) seeds that small planters have been using for years.
It is true that some forms of cultivation and cattle rearing can be done on a large scale and that big investments are needed, even if small scale farming is to develop.
But it does not mean that the knowledge and tradition that has been developed in this sector must be “eradicated”, as the Government intends to do.
Traditional cultivation and cattle rearing must not be eliminated.
We must use already acquired knowledge and experience.
The MMM-MSM governments true consideration is to produce as per the WTO philosophy, not with and for scientific progress.
Only commercial considerations, that is a narrow definition of productivity and efficiency, and short-term profit are their only motivation.
The link between agriculture and transformation of agricultural produce is not new in Mauritius.
It already exists here, even though it is on a small scale.
One advantage that we have in Mauritius is that we already have a long tradition of knowledge in the preservation and transformation of food. People know how to make jam, pickles, chutneys, and conserves from a diverse range of fruits and vegetables.
It is based upon this know-how that certain family enterprises have started to commercialize jam, jelly, fruit juice, crystallized fruits, pickles, chutneys, sometimes on a semi-industrial scale: either in cans, in bottles or plastic bags.
These technologies are already mastered, and are very successful.
As for cattle rearing, the situation is similar.
Nowadays there are factories, which produce pasteurized milk, yogurt or ghee.
There is also a great diversity of products from chicken, pork, fish and shrimps that are sold in plastic bags.
Some of those products are exported.
These kinds of local produce are the possible basis for a transformation and preservation industry for local, regional, and international demand.
The economical crises that we are witnessing today are certainly creating a new kind of initiative amongst the people to think deeply and collectively about a new form of agriculture and new forms of agro-industry.
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO?
Facilities should be provided to those who are interested in developing this sector on an industrial and scientific level.
For example tax should be removed on all machinery used in this sector.
Non-polluting form of energy, which will also decrease our dependence upon petroleum products, should be encouraged to be used in these small industries.
Research institutes must be encouraged to direct their work towards the amelioration of this industry’s products.
Exchanges between the University of Mauritius, planters and breeders must be made so as to develop not only traditional but more rational methods.
Facilities should be given to people to learn from other countries like China, Cuba and other countries advanced in this sector.
Necessary facilities should be given to modernize agriculture in Rodrigues.
In sum, we need an economic policy, which will encourage the development of scientific agriculture based on what is already used in Mauritius, which will produce not only for the local market but also for exportation.
The government must invest in this kind of industry instead of spending large sums of money for the benefit of the textile, tourist and sugar sectors capitalists.
The government slogans about “bio-technology” are not solutions, neither are new techniques like GMO, which aims only at guaranteeing the profit of multinationals which has control on this technology.
THE THREAT OF GMOs.
In the 90’s the multinationals financed laboratories to invent methods of genetically modifying living organisms.
They called it GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms).
Some traditional and conventional methods have been used over the ages, so as to increase production of plants; but when genetic transfers are being used in food production, it can be very dangerous.
They have used this new invention to put patents on living things, and this has been done with the help of the WTO (World Trade Organization).
With this new form of agriculture, nature and people’s health on our planet earth are in great danger.
The first introduction of GMO in Mauritius has been done by the MSIRI in May 1999 with the presentation of a new transgenic sugar cane, but there was no legal framework in those days.
Following this research, Maurice Le Court De Billot, a Monsanto laboratory representative visited Mauritius and declared that the “Mauritius Sugar Industry Research Institute is well ahead concerning the utilization of GMO in the sugar cane sector and that they were interested” (From an interview in L’Express newspaper 22 October 2000).
Multinationals like Monsanto, Novartis, Aventis are striving so as to get the monopoly on seeds through control over distribution, thus they will have control over our food supply.
The Mauritian Government helped them by passing a law, the “Genetically Modified Organisms Act” in March 2004; this gave legal support for the utilization, marketing and application of GMOs in the alimentary and agricultural sectors.
We must stress that this law is in conflict with the United Nations convention on biodiversity called ‘FAO Concept of Farmers’ Rights’, which points to the necessity of the “Precautionary Principle”, which allows the concerned parties to refuse to produce and commercialize GMOs as long as it has not been proven to be harmless to health.
An organism is genetically modified when genetic materials from other or from the same species are added to it.
Through this process, the organism will produce new proteins, which will give them new functions.
Those who promote GMOs are saying that its quality and quantity will increase, that it will be more resistant to bacteria, parasites, and climatic conditions.
They also say that GMO will wipe out hunger from the earth.
What they are keeping secret, is that:
* No GMO commercialization concerns increase in food production.
It is always in the interest of the multinational’s profit.
With 99% of the seeds produced, the firm produces herbicides and insecticides, which can be used only with their seeds.
This means they will also sell more of their different kinds of poison.
Thus they will control each stage in the food production chain.
They will only produce GMOs that will be resistant to their herbicides.
This also means that it will encourage people to use more herbicides and pesticides, and thus we will consume more herbicides and pesticides.
* Most of the GMO seeds can be used only once, implying that for us to get seeds for the next season, we won’t be able or we won’t have the right to use seeds from the fruits of our previous harvest.
So we will be forced to go back to Novartis each time we sow, and they will probably have the monopoly on this species and the price will thus depends only on them.
They name this “Intellectual Property Rights” or “Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights” (TRIPS).
* Research has shown that with the wind and pollinating insects, transgenic plants contaminate other plants nearby.
This can risk endangering the ecological balance by killing species of insects and plants.
It is not only a danger to our ecology but also to cultivation as well, where GMOs are not used.
* No research has been done on the effect of GMOs on human health in the long term.
A scientist who studied the effects that genetically modified potatoes had on rats, observed that the consummation of GMOs during 3 weeks has shrunk the brain, increased the volume of the pancreas and affected the immune system of these animals.
This process cannot be reversed because these plants will keep these genetic manipulations forever.
All this goes to show that GMO utilization might in fact end up increasing hunger in the world because of the risks to nature and to people’s health.
Even if the catastrophe scenarios do not occur we will live under the slavery of these multinationals, which will control our food supply.
In the feudal period the lords controlled the peasants by proclaiming themselves as the owners of the land, nowadays their descendants are proclaiming themselves to be the owners of plant seeds, and as if this was not enough they are setting about destroying our planet earth.
But today there is an international movement fighting this theft of the multinationals over agriculture:  a movement regrouping peasants, planters, cattle breeders, progressive unions, left political parties, ecologists, women and youth organizations.
In Mauritius, we have seen these types of organizations group together to protest against and to warn the MMM-MSM Government against the utilization of GMO seeds and products, at the time that the Government brought in its own GMOs.
Lalit was one of the organizations in this movement.
Even though there have been protests, the law was passed in the national assembly in March 2004.
COMMON PROTEST AGAINST THE GMO BILL (GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS).
Given that there is sufficient food production for everybody on planet earth and that the problem of hunger and famine is instead due to the politics of distribution;
Given that 99% of the research on GMOs is done by private multinational companies which aim at profit-maximization for their stake holders;
Given that multinationals which are engaged in the production of seeds (MOSANTO, etc), produce 99% of GMO seeds so as to tolerate their herbicides (poisons) such as Round-up or to transform the tree itself into insecticides (more poison), that is they are increasing the dangerous products dosage in food;
Given that multinationals aim at a monopoly on the production of seeds, they made it illegal to re-use their seeds (with WTO agreement), or impossible to use it more than once (due to the fact that it is a ‘terminator’ seed and it cannot reproduce itself);
Given that studies done in the United States of America have shown that American food production has been contaminated in a more vast way than scientists had predicted, in fact through wind and pollination insects;
Given that pollinating insects can be affected by it, this results in great risk of contamination for agricultural reproduction of other foods;
Given that nature itself (beyond agriculture) is being affected by the GMOs, which are not being controlled;
Given that the WTO allows private companies to take out “patents on life”, this means that food security of the worlds people is critically under threat;
Given that the consequences on human beings and human health, on animals, are totally unpredictable, and given that recent studies in United Kingdom show an increase in “allergic” reactions due to GMOs;
Given that the change brought about by GMOs can be irreversible because it deals with genetic materials;
AND IN MAURITIUS,
Given that there is a risk of popular boycott of our sugar in Europe if it is not “GMO-FREE”,
Given the awareness of tourists on GMO contamination,
Given that Mauritius is constituted of islands and Archipelagoes, we have the possibility of an agriculture, which is really “GMO-FREE”, thus giving it a great commercial value,
Given that the first GMOs that have been manipulated by the MSIRI has been done specifically to make sugar cane resistant to Round-Up herbicide,
WE THE UNDERSIGNED:
* Denounce all the propaganda of multinational companies and local private companies, which say that GMOs are designed to decrease suffering in the world.
* Demand a prompt withdrawal of the bill proposed by the MMM/MSM/PMSD/FTS/LES VERTS government.
* Demand that the government come forward with a new bill which:
a) Insists that imported food should be labeled “GMO-FREE”.
b) Insist that all research and development be done by the government without any influence or funding from the private sector or the multinational companies.
c) That all commercialization of all future GMO plants, which are not necessary in our world, should be done under the ‘Precautionary Principle’, that is it is the duty of the company, which is selling something to the public, to prove that it will not have any harmful effect on any future consumer.
The list of organizations which endorsed this common protestation in March 2004: Institute for Consumer Protection, Ledikasyon pu Travayer, Rodrigues Government Employees’ Association, Muvman Liberation Fam, Mouvement pour l’Autosuffisance Alimentaire, Lalit, ABAIM, Federation of Pre-School Playgroups.
In the past, due to the fact that cultivation and cattle rearing had been done only on a commercial basis for profit, there has not been enough thinking on how to integrate different types of plant cultivation and also cattle rearing within the same project.
According to the narrow-minded capitalist economists, sugar produced by the sugar industry must be profitable, inter-line cropping done by planters must be profitable, cattle rearing must be profitable.
The absence of any thought on the development of an integrated agriculture is very serious for Mauritius, given that our resources in terms of the amount of arable land is obviously very limited.
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURE.
The present system evaluates agricultural production on the amount of “profit” that land owners make.
There are other ways to evaluate agricultural production.
For example it is essential to assess whether this production can be maintained over time.
This is called “sustainable agricultural production”.
It also questions whether this agricultural production takes into account our environment, our ecology?
Furthermore, it is necessary to take into account human knowledge, that of planters and cattle breeders, and guarantee the continued transmission of this knowledge from one generation to the next.
There are many experiments that have been done on different kinds of agriculture, which in fact do respect these criteria.
For example “integrated farming” in China, where profit-making is not the main motive, but other questions are taken into consideration.
Whether water supply in the long term is protected?
Whether there is misuse of resources, when it is not necessary?
Then, they can actually re-allocate resources when necessary;
for example, they can increase or decrease the proportion of workers on the farm, or in the related industries.
Researchers are also closely linked into production.
The proportion of researchers can also be changed – if the ‘integrated nature’ of this approach is respected.
Researchers are directly linked to the real needs of those who cultivate the land, and those working in the agro-industrial factory.
It is not unconnected like in the ordinary capitalist system.
There have been 100 million of workers that have shifted from ‘on farm’ to ‘off farm’ in China’s agro-industry, without diminishing agricultural production.
On the contrary, food production in different forms has increased: in cans, frozen, freeze-dried, pickled, dried, and preserved in all forms.
The capitalist system is always on the look-out for a quick “profit”.
But what is even truer is that they are always looking at profit in the short term only.
In the long run even capitalist production will lose out, in lots of ways: the soil will get impoverished; the environment spoilt; underground water supplies will decrease drastically; the capitalist negligence will destroy insects and animals which contribute to the perpetuation of life on our planet.
In the mid-west of the United States, the soil has been so impoverished (through uncontrolled cultivation and petrol exploitation), that today there is desertification over there.
In Israel in the 1950’s the Kibbutz cooperatives developed integrated farming with an adapted irrigation system in the desert of Negev.
This shows how cooperation and integrated development can develop a new agricultural system.
Planters and farmers in regions where there is a scarcity of water like in India and Australia have also carried out this experiment.
To cultivate in deserts and arid and semi-arid regions, is worthy twice-over.
Firstly it is worthy, because it allows the development of seeds, which can resist the desert climate, and it allows cultivation in regions where water is scarce.
Secondly, it helps to prevent desertification.
These kinds of long term vision will not be possible with agriculture based on the profit motive.
In Mauritius there have been experiments on cattle rearing, cultivation and fish breeding.
The St Martin project has been one of those experiences, where waste from one production unit is recycled naturally into the next stage without it being of any cost (e.g. chicken waste becomes fertilizer).
This is an advantage because it increases the value of one waste product, and makes it become useful, replacing the need for fertilizers which cost money, pollute the earth and water, and can be harmful for the flora and the fauna.
This kind of production (like in China or Mauritius) can be done on a large scale or can be done through the link between different projects (small planters and cattle breeders, cooperating in the same process).
See references at the end of the book for articles on cooperative like the Plaisance & La Ferme Mixed Farming Society and on experiments in China.
This system brings the land ownership question into focus.
Landowners have short-term interests; more profit can be made through speculation very often, than through agriculture.
For example IRS (Integrated Resort Schemes) will seem more profitable to land-owners than the development of the food sector, even though the latter would enhance the economy for everybody.
As long as land will be under private control, it will be very difficult to get the degree of food security that is essential for the people.
We must move towards a collective control and ownership of land.
The consequence of private control of land is that most human beings have no access to land at all.
This means that their contribution toward agricultural and economic development is absent, and thus our overall production of ideas is impoverished.
Productivity growth is limited.
Dynamic development comes through research, observation and the transmission of millenarian knowledge.
There is urgency in this work.
If we lose this millenarian knowledge, we will never get it again.
This means that we, the people of the planet, could be under the direct control of the big multinationals, registered in the United States, and which want to make profit through registering patents on life (seeds and animals), and where our food security will be endangered.
In the present context, it is important that we put the question of the production of energy together with agriculture and agro-industry.
The traditional petroleum sources of energy (fossil fuels) are becoming more and more expensive, and represent a serious and irreversible threat to our ecology.
Thus it is necessary to think on a new politics for the supply of energy.
All modern production is dependant on energy.
RENEWABLE ENERGY.
LALIT’S DEMANDS.
So, these are some of the real alternatives that are part of the Lalit campaign.
Everywhere in the world as well as in Mauritius and Rodrigues, the public is fed up with development, which is only in the interest of some capitalists short term profits.
We are fed up with governments which act as facilitators for these capitalists who are making profits.
Lalit is proposing to mobilize the public, and particularly working people and those who work the land, on these demands which will allow us to get out of the “economic catastrophe” that we about to experience.
In the present context, people will easily understand the transitional nature of our proposals.
That is, they are not only reasonable but they are necessary.
The present system will be put into question when we put forward these eminently reasonable demands.
The present system cannot deal with these demands.
Simultaneously they are demands, which will only be possible when the political and economic balance of power gets to be in favour of the working class and the people, and when we will be able to make the ruling class to bear the brunt of the present crisis where there economic policy has brought us.
Here are our demands and propositions:
* A conversion to a massive food production through ‘organic’ and ‘green’ method on a big scale, for our local needs and for exportations.
(This big scale can be either ‘big unit’ like the sugar estates are nowadays, or composed of many ‘little units’ that work together like a true cooperative.)
Thus Mauritius will be able to deal with the disaster of the sugar industry faced with the dismantling of the Sugar Protocol, and at the same time be the avant-garde of a “GMO-free guarantee” food producer.
This will create employment and at the same time protect Mauritius’ natural heritage.
We have the advantage of being a nation of islands, so that we can be free from “contamination par les OGM”.
* The compulsory conversion of all sugar mills that are closing into agro-industrial factories, especially for massive exportation.
This will create employment and can decrease the perilous effect of globalization that is threatening every country in the world.
* In the fisheries, Lalit proposes that the government compels the private sector into investing in fishing on an industrial level, or the government might itself invest in this sector.
We must claim our rights on our Economic Zone around all the islands of our Republic, including Chagos and Tromelin.
Chagossians must have the priority to work in every economic development in Chagos.
At the same time the Government must invest in the Barachois, fish breeding in marine farms, and the transformation of marine products, not only a “Sea-Food Hub” that will be like a fish free-zone.
* The government must use the “European Compensation” for which negotiation are taking place in exchange for the Sugar Protocol dismantling, for this food production campaign, and stop perpetuating a squandering sugar industry.
* We need an “Optimal Land Utilization Authority” instead of a “Sugar Authority” which is obsolete.
* We need to oppose any new WTO “round” and put off the ancient WTO agreement till a “World-Wide Audit”.
* No to the privatization of the CEB.
This process must be reversed now, and the CEB bureaucracy replaced by a democratic structure.
Yes to a massive development of ‘clean’ and ‘renewable’ energy like solar energy, wind energy, tidal and wave energy.
With this kind of vision, and a well-planned CEB, Mauritius can become a world leader in clean, durable and, in the long term, cheap energy.
This will create employment as well as decrease pollution.
* Stop privatization of any new sector and stop the processes of privatization.
* Stop any form of politics, which try to destroy traditional agriculture. – Yes! To politics, which build scientific knowledge on knowledge and experience which planters, cattle breeder and fisherwoman/man had learned and accumulated from generation to generation.
* The University of Mauritius should orientate research towards agricultural production based on traditional knowledge, not on its substitute.
This kind of research should become conversant with the agro-industrial sector instead of the main objective of commercialization of product in short run.
*Profit based GMO product must be stopped.
The government must change the law on bio-technology so that it will be based on the ‘Precautionary Principle’.
Mauritius must develop a market for ‘Guaranteed GMO-Free’ products.
* To begin the immediate processes for the re-orientation of institutions that were set up to support Sugar Industry, to decline the emphasis made on sugar, and put more effort in the direction to develop agro-industry.
* There is an urgency to set up an insurance to protect and encourage planters who engaged in the agricultural diversification production.
MODERN TECHNOLOGY.
Modern technology had allowed conditions for a greater form of democracy in the organization of the economy.
We should be able to have the necessary political mean to demand to ask for more democracy.
Technological progress increase the capacity of production in a sufficient amount so that workers who are occupied in production had the ability to run production, instead of only following the instructions from an employee who’s only interest is the making of profit.
OUR PROPOSALS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN?
Basically, Lalit says that the government must compel the sugar factories ( and private sectors in general) to create employment, production of food, investing in agro-industries for the local market and also for exportation purposes, and to produce clean and renewable energy.
But however it is not acceptable for people having land to refuse to produce food and that people who wants to produce food do not have land.
It is not acceptable that people who possess capital do not create employment and people in need of a work do not have the capital that they themselves produced.
Eventually this bankrupt capitalist system must be overthrown and replaced by a socialist system where people organize collectively.

Association Against Police Violence.
Fundamental Principles.
Bearing in mind that the Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads : “Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.” ;
Recalling that one of the most important uprisings of the whole of the people in our history was sparked off by the death of Kaya in police cells on the 21st of February, 1999;
And remembering that Kaya’s death, unelucidated up to today, is not the first case of suspicious death in police cells.
Since independence, there have been about thirty unexplained deaths in detention;
Noting that since the death in police cells of Kaya, there have been a further ten cases of unexplained deaths during arrest and detention, the most recent being those of Lorlène Dumazel in February 2001, Vijay Nancy in June 2001, Josian Bayaram in July 2001 and Clifford David in March 2002;
Bearing in mind all those who have been victim of police violence, of inhuman torture, and sadistic behaviour of police officers, who while on duty, abuse their position of power conferred on them by Law, with impunity;
Recalling that the State of Mauritius is signatory to:
•	The 1976 “International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights” that guarantees the right to liberty and security of each person,
•	The 1986 “African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights”;
•	The 1997 “Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment” that specifically declares that the “term ‘torture’ means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official or other person acting in an official capacity”;
Recalling that Article (3) (a) of the Constitution of Mauritius similarly guarantees “the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and the protection of the law”,
Given that the rule of law renders the State responsible and liable for the actions, omissions, misdemeanours and crimes of its police agents and that, in addition, they must be brought to justice for their breaches of the criminal law or infringements of human rights, as all other citizens;
Aware of the fact that such police officers are in a position of power and abuse this power in their relations with to certain categories of citizens such as youth, the unemployed, people who are poor or otherwise socially oppressed, who do not have the means to defend themselves to ensure that their rights are respected;
Considering that we are all equal before the law, and that every person, without distinction, has the right to equal protection of the law, it is worth noting that every person, charged by police is presumed innocent until proven guilty by an open Court of law in which the person is ensured a proper defence;
Bearing in mind that it is essential that the media, especially the press and journalists, be conscious of their key role in denouncing cases of police violence and promoting and protecting human rights.
However, this contribution should be made in a professional and ethical manner.
The media must be made aware of its influence on public opinion, and should exert caution in publicizing photographs of a shocking or sensational nature so as to respect the privacy of victims and their families;
Rejecting all attempts by public institutions to cover-up or minimise cases of police violence by accusing victims or their families of exaggeration or of fabricating allegations, so as to renounce their responsibilities or to try to justify such violence by claiming that it is part of “Mauritian culture” and thus accept it with cynicism and doom.
Agriculture, Agro-Industry and Electricity.
It is a key moment in Mauritian history for us to stop and think.
Economic disaster could easily be looking us in the face very soon.
And it is not just Lalit saying so anymore.
The bosses and the Government are finally coming to terms with the bankruptcy of their economy.
The Sugar Industry, even they admit it now at long last, has no future.
Free-Zone-style industries haven’t either.
Mass redundancies in the Sugar Industry under the notorious VRS are now being more than matched by textile factory closures on a scale never seen before.
And the bosses now openly promise worse to come.
Unemployment will begin to reach mortal levels soon.
Government is doing no more than taking measures that ultimately only serve to aggravate these two major problems.
While all these key things are taking place, there is also an important debate going on about the future of the CEB, a sector central to long-term planning.
Lalit’s Demands.
Here is an outline of our campaign:
1.	We demand mass conversion of land to planting of food, and this to be done by “organic” and “green” methods on a huge scale, for peoples’ food needs and, on a larger scale than ever before, for export.
This way Mauritius can get around the disaster that the sugar industry is facing as the Sugar Protocol runs out.
This way Mauritius can become a world leader in food production, which is guaranteed GMO-FREE.
This will create employment on a large scale, and, at the same time, respect Mauritius’ natural heritage.
2.	We demand compulsory conversion of ex-sugar mills into agro-industrial plants, for exporting produce.
This will create employment and absorb the shock of the ruinous globalization that the multinationals are subjecting us to.
3.	oppose all new “rounds” at the WTO and to call for suspension of existing WTO agreements until a “World-wide Social Audit”.
4.	We oppose privatization of the CEB.
Unfortunately the present debate on CEB is very parochial, never ever touching on the key issues being addressed world-wide in this epoch, i.e. kinds of energy that are neither polluting nor blindly reliant on finite stocks of fossil fuels that are being depleted irrationally.
5.	We demand massive investment into research and production of genuinely renewable and clean energy. In particular Solar, Wind and Sea (tidal and wave) energies.
This can create a lot of employment and keep our islands’ ecologies balanced.
Food production for export.
As long ago as in 1982-83, Lalit was already in the middle of a campaign to warn of the dangers of leaving the Sugar Oligarchs to dictate agricultural politics of the whole country. What happened then, was that we bumped into State repression.
We had a Slide Show and Talk Series called “Disik, Ki Lavenir?” that was touring towns and villages of Mauritius.
We were, even then, proposing a legal framework that would oblige the Sugar Estates to plant their rows of cane in a format that allows inter-line cropping of food crops every year, and not just when there is new cane planted every seven or so years.
The MMM-PSM Government did not take kindly to our Slide Show and Talk Series.
The Sugar bosses were furious too.
The police banned the Slide Show.
Now, when it is almost too late, when the Sugar Oligarchs have even gone and aggravated the situation by producing electricity from cane bagasse, now the Bosses and the Government, twenty years too late, find themselves in a blind panic.
We call on Government to get out of the rut of a ‘Sugar Authority’ and to break away from its obsession with sugar (an obsession which seems to blind them) and to think big for once.
What we need, in organizational terms, is something like an ‘Optimal Land Utilization Authority’ that proposes and helps research into crops that, for example, produce harvests three times in one year.
The Mauritian climate and soil is ideal for this kind of diversified food crop.
The peoples’ interests were never served by this kind of blinkered thinking.
The debate on electricity is part of this overall debate.
At the moment when Jack Bizlall, Swaleh Kasenally, Jean Mée Desvaux are arguing, it is mainly about the cost of production.
It’s about whether the CEB is producing electricity cheaper than the Sugar Estates.
It’s about whether, based on the cost of production,  it should be the Sugar Estates, multinational corporations, or the CEB itself that produces power.
And sometimes the debate also scouts around the edges of the equally important question of privatization.
In Lalit’s campaign, we are linking two-or-three important issues into the debate.
Firstly, we believe it is a fundamental human right to have a power supply in one’s home.
At the same time, we believe that the new generation of “ecological rights” gives us a basic right to an unpolluted environment.
This means we believe that the debate should not be limited to the question of the selling price of what is a “factor of production” for some consumers and a mere “commodity” for others.
With the increases in our electricity bills coming so regularly, with a number of families being burnt to death because of having to use candle-light in times when the precautions for these are no longer even known, with increasing unemployment, and with work that is here today gone tomorrow, the right to an electric supply in the home (as well as other things like running water, telephone, public transport) has to be respected.
If this means subsidy, it must be subsidized. We must point out that Mauritius is a signatory, and that since 1976, to the UN Convention on Social and Economic Rights.
At the same time, with the pollution being caused by “fossil-fuels”, and with the Sugar Industry (responsible for bagasse) imploding; Lalit is thus launching a double element in this campaign: No to privatization of the CEB! And pressure for CEB to turn to research and massive investment in sources of modern, clean and genuinely renewable energy.
Let us not now, as we finally get free (forcibly, as it turns out) from the prison of sugar, become prisoners of cane-for-bagasse. Land must be freed for the huge food production for export that is necessary.
Renewable sources of power create employment as well as keeping the environment in harmony.
The future lies in renewable power sources.
And it is Government that should be made to take the initiative.
Everywhere in the world where there are developments in the use of Wind Power, for example, it is through “government-enabling initiatives”, whether in Germany, Denmark, USA, Spain, India, the UK and the Netherlands, in the first generation, and now in China, Canada, various South American countries, and Australia.
In the USA, the biggest ever Wind Farm took only one year to set up.
Thousands of jobs were created.
Instead of paying for increasingly expensive fossil fuels, the same money pays workers for the ongoing upkeep of the farm.
Wind Power is already cheaper than coal-produced power (if you include as a cost the health bills of miners).
Mauritius, Rodrigues and Agalega are blessed with constant South East Trade Winds that make wind energy very easy.
CEB is planning already to set up 3 Wind turbines in Trefles, in Rodrigues.
As well as Wind Power being an enormous potential, there is also power production from the movement of the sea, which is ideal for islands like Mauritius, Rodrigues and Agalega.
There is both Wave Energy (one type of technology, where turbines are turned by the coming and going of each wave near the edge of the sea) and there is Tidal Energy (the constant rise and fall of the tide turning turbines).
Britain has recently invested 1.1 million pounds in a Tidal plant.
So, instead of Mauritius continuing to accept old technology (and often ‘dumping’ of obsolete technology from Europe and elsewhere), we propose massive investment in new, modern forms of power-production.
World-wide (and here it is the same) people are sick to death of development plans that are concocted in the interests of facilitating capitalists and their profit.

Declaration of Grande Riviere on Chagos.
The Conference on Diego Garcia & Chagos held at Grande Riviere, Port Louis, Mauritius, bringing together 150 participants from 30 October to 2 November 2010, reached consensus that we will keep the following struggles firmly bound together, never bartering one against the other:
- the struggle for the complete decolonization of the Republic of Mauritius, the dismantling of the British Indian Ocean Territories colony, and the re-unification of the country,
- the struggle for the closing down of the US military base on Diego Garcia, and its ecological clean-up by the US.
- the struggle for the right of return and full reparations for all Chagossians,
And that to advance these aims, and given that there are some actions that can be set in motion only by the State of Mauritius,
we commit ourselves to putting pressure on the Mauritian State towards its acting in practice so as:
- To organize a formal State visit on the Trochetia ship to Diego Garcia and the whole of Chagos, which is part of Mauritian territory defined as such by the Constitution, and that the State delegation should include the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition;
- To enter a case in the UN International Court of Justice at the Hague through at once inscribing a Resolution to this precise effect on the agenda for the next UN General Assembly due in 2011, and continuing to ensure that the Resolution is not later withdrawn from the agenda;
- To make a formal demand for UN inspections under the Pelindaba Treaty, as soon as the mechanism for doing so comes into force later this year.

Communique of Ledikasyon pu Travayer for its 2004 UNESCO Literacy Prize.
2004 UNESCO LITERACY PRIZE AWARDED TO LEDIKASYON PU TRAVAYER.
The 2004 International Reading Association Literacy Award, has been awarded to Ledikasyon Pu Travayer(LPT), a prize that UNESCO awards to organisations that are contributing in a significant way in the struggle to promote literacy for all.
What does this prize means for LPT?
This award represents an international recognition for the work done by LPT for 28 years.
According to a UNESCO Press release dated 18th May 2004, it is mentioned that LPT has been awarded this prize "for its adult literacy programme, which places emphasis on women, its respect for cultural context and the use of mother languages".
Secondly we think that this award attributes a special value to the work of promoting literacy itself. It recognises the importance of making literacy accessible to everyone.
This correspond to UNESCO campaign "Education For All".
And in LPT we have always been promoting education as a right.
This award is a form of recognition of the contribution of women in LPT.
LPT was born in the wake of the student protest movement of May 1975 where college girls were in the forefront.
Since our foundation our women members have made a significant contribution in all aspects of our work and in the internal life of our organisation itself.
Whether it is in our literacy courses, our teacher training sessions or in the struggle for the recognition of mother languages in Mauritius.
This award is the recognition for our persistent and constant work in the use of mother languages in adult literacy.
We are known for being obstinate on this issue and we are still like that.
Today this UNESCO award is saying that LPT was right in maintaining this basic pedagogical principle that every person learns better in his or her mother language. No expert in education would say the contrary on this matter.
Through this award UNESCO also wanted to draw world attention on the necessity to produce written materials in mother languages.
Today UNESCO is recognising the contribution of LPT in the production, publication and circulation of every kind of literature in the Kreol and Bhojpuri languages.
We dedicate this award to:
every women and men, from villages, coastal areas and towns who have participated in our literacy courses all voluntary teachers who have organised, run and nurture our literacy courses and at the same time contributed in the development of the pedagogy that we are using now.
All our members who year after year have been nurturing our association and have contributed to its development.
all our supporting members who have actively participated in our activities and supported our work.
all local and international organisations with whom we have cooperated and who supported our work.
all writers, poets, artists, academics, journalists, teachers, students and other individuals in Mauritius, Rodrigues and other countries who have been associated with our work to promote our mother languages, for the right to education and for linguistic diversity.
We take note of all this human effort put together into the work and action for the mother languages of the people of the Republic of Mauritius to develop and flourish.
UNESCO will give this prize to LPT on the 8th September 2004 on the occasion of International Literacy Day.
Ledikasyon pu Travayer (Mauritius) has been awarded UNESCO's 2004 International Literacy prize.
Ledikasyon pu Travayer (LPT) has been awarded UNESCO's 2004 International Literacy prize.
This prize is called The International Reading Association Literacy Award.
Ledikasyon pu Travayer won this award for its adult literacy work, which places the emphasis on women, its respect for cultural context and use of mother languages.
UNESCO also mentions that Ledikasyon pu Travayer has also produced, printed and distributed books - including the Mauritian Creole dictionary - and reading materials covering every aspect of learners' lives.
This prize will be awarded on 8th September 2004 on the occasion of the World Literacy Day.
Since 28 years Ledikasyon pu Travayer is undertaking the literacy work.
In the same time LPT, one among the pioneer organisations which is still promoting Mother tongue based Education LPT is dedicating this award to all participants, animators, members, supporting members, and all Associations and individuals in the Republic of Mauritius and abroad who are still struggling for the recognition of mother tongue.
In the context of the World Kreol Language Day Ledikasyon pu Travayer has sent this letter to the Minister of Education of Mauritius.
Ledikasyon pu Travayer,
153 Main Road, Grand River North West,
Port Louis, Republic of Mauritius.
Minister of Education, Hon. Steve Obeegadoo, Ministry of Education and Science, Phoenix.
Dear Minister,
We are writing this letter to you about the medium used in schools.
We would like you to take this letter as a formal notice that your language policy is harming children.
You have been in charge of the Ministry of Education for the past three whole years now.
As the Minister in charge of education, you are responsible for children who go to school in Mauritius, Rodrigues, and Agalega.
In particular you are now legally even more directly liable for any harm that children come to, once education has become compulsory, and after your recent hard-hitting campaign to force parents to send their children to school.
Your Department therefore doesn't provide education only to parents who choose to send their children to school now, but actually compels parents to send their children to school, failing which you can bring criminal charges against them.
It is, thus, imperative that school does not do any harm to children.
If children do suffer harm from attending school, whether the harm is inflicted on purpose or through negligence, or even ignorance, and especially if the harm has long-term effects, it is you that will be liable for damages.
And more importantly, it is you that will have been responsible, and thus you who will have this harm on your conscience for the rest of your life.
Hence, this letter is to warn you that your politics on the medium of education amounts to no less than "linguistic genocide" being perpetrated in schools.
And today, in the context of the World Kreol Language Day, we are making a formal and public appeal to you to stop killing children's mother tongues in school, through the politics of excluding Mauritian Kreol and Mauritian Bhojpuri from schools, thus forcing children to change from their own linguistic group to the group of another.
We are formally making an appeal to you to stop making children suffer the severe mental harm that is provoked by the constant insinuation in schools that children's mother tongues are inferior, are of no use or are not real languages.
The damage done is inestimable.
This letter is to explain to you in detail the harm that you are causing to children in Mauritius.
This letter is to explain to you that everywhere in the world all linguists and all human rights activists agree with us when we accuse you of the crime of 'linguistic genocide'.
And once you have been formally informed by this letter, you cannot then continue the same harmful policies.
We are writing because maybe you don't know about the genocidal effects of your policies.
May be in the future you will plead "ignorance".
May be the Government will plead ignorance.
We note that you had announced that you would decide about the use of mother tongue in school after consulting UNESCO.
It depends, you announced, what UNESCO tells you is best.
Then in an interview in Le Mauricien of Saturday 27th September, you say that UNESCO says that the mother tongue/s must be used.
Naturally, UNESCO says that.
All experts in the world have been saying this for a very long time now.
Then, when UNESCO gives you this reply, you change your story. You now announce, in that same interview, that you will not listen to UNESCO.
You will, instead have two small pilot projects, one school in Mauritius, one in Rodrigues with the maternal language.
This means that you intend to continue pretending, though UNESCO has informed you of the contrary, that you are unaware of the harm that school is doing to EVERY CHILD because of an erroneous policy on the use of the medium of education.
The issue of what medium to use in school is not just a question of "Which medium will get children better test results".
Although we should put on record that clearly all studies in the entire world, as you well know, have already proved beyond all doubt that mother tongue instruction produces better results in all subjects, from science to additional languages, from subjects that involve creativity to subject that demand reasoning.
We have a section on all this research later in this "Open Letter".
What is much more important in the use of mother tongue (and here we are speaking, in the first instance, of Kreol and Bhojpuri) is that it permits all children to develop their intelligence better.
Their cognitive progress is very much faster and gets to a higher level (throughout the rest of their lives) if they learn through their mother tongue at school.
It is not just a question of exam results.
Human language is a natural capacity that all human beings have.
It is our means, par excellence, of understanding the world around us.
Our linguistic capacity develops before we ourselves even realize it in small babies, and then during all their childhood, and on for the rest of their lives.
If we develop a child's mother tongue well, and if there is no policy forbidding or hampering this development, if the child becomes high-level literate, he or she will be able to operate up to a high level, he or she will be able to study to a high level, he or she will be able to make an academic contribution to a high level.
There is a world of difference between what in the education profession are called Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP).
In Mauritius, most children, even those who get as far as University, show signs of having severe problems in cognition, that is to say in CALP.
A university lecturer attests to this difficulty with her students.
In a second or even third language, we cannot pretend to outstrip our development in our mother tongue.
And in school, you are responsible for systematically hampering the crucial natural development of children's intelligence through their own mother tongue.
If we develop this capacity (i.e. high level cognitive and academic proficiency) in our mother tongue, then we will be able to become equally capable in other languages.
This is what is called high-level bilingualism.
It means the mother tongue to a high level, plus another language that can develop to the same high level, too, that is to the level of CALP.
High-level trilinguals are those who have developed their mother tongue to a high level plus two other languages to the same high level.
High-level multilingualism means the ability to operate at a high level in the mother tongue and then in many other languages almost as well.
Your school system, M. Obeegadoo, is continuing making our children "demi-lingual".
What do we mean by this "demi-lingual"?
You are making children suffer serious incapacity as a result of harming the natural development of high-level linguistic skills in any language.
What we are accusing you of is of preventing children from developing high-level cognitive and academic proficiency.
If somebody is "mono-lingual" to a high level (that is, they have CALP only in Kreol or only in Bhojpuri), that person will still, theoretically, be able to get along in terms of cognitive and academic proficiency.
But, more to the good, he or she can then become a high level bilingual or trilingual (CALP), provided that he has reached a high level in his or her mother tongue.
In LPT, as far as we are concerned, we are in favour of all our children becoming high level multilingual.
If someone does not develop his linguistic skills in his mother tongue up to a high level, then, after formal schooling, it can take up to an additional nine years of formal education to compensate for the loss of the reduced development of the child who has been subjected to education not in his mother tongue.
We also accuse certain high up officers at the Ministry and at the MIE and some academics at the University of having a fawning attitude towards you as Minister of Education.
They pretend that they think that Kreol and Bhojpuri are not good as the medium because they "get the signal" from politicians in power, like you, that this is what they must say to be in your good books.
But, when Prof. Derek Bickerton was here, at a seminar with high-up officers, all of them agree with him vocally that the only possible medium of instruction is the mother tongue.
The same thing when Prof. Tove Skutnabb-Kangas was here.
All sorts of lecturers and top academics agree with her when she says that Kreol and Bhojpuri must be medium of instruction.
When Dr. Neville Alexander was here, no linguistics academic in Mauritius challenged him, when he said we must use the mother tongue.
There is a simple reason for this.
No linguist anywhere in the world can say in front of a panel of his colleague linguists, that it is advisable to use a language which is not mother tongue as medium in schools.
The prejudice against the Kreol and Bhojpuri languages, that they are supposedly inferior languages, comes directly from colonial times, when the colonists and their academia, the civil servants and even the religious hierarchy, believed and spread the false belief that these languages are inferior.
Do you, Minister, still think this?
Or you just apply your politics as if you still think this?
Human Rights.
Sir, imposing either totally or partially unknown (or erroneously grasped) languages as medium in education flies in the face of all established pedagogical principles that have been established and continue to be established.
No child's mother tongue is inferior to any other language.
We say that your Department is, by the following policies and practices, giving the clear and harmful signal that Kreol and Bhojpuri-speaking children's language is inferior.
Absence of any text books in either Kreol or Bhojpuri.
Failure to teach even literacy and numeracy through Kreol or Bhojpuri.
Absence of books to read, failure to develop songs and games, in Kreol and Bhojpuri.
Absence of any examinations in Kreol or Bhojpuri
Absence of Kreol and Bhojpuri as subjects in schools.
Tendency, because of your language policy, for teachers to transmit to children a feeling of disaffection for their parents' language.
Failure to train teachers in how to use the children's own language so that children understand with any precision in class, and express themselves with the precision necessary.
Tendency for children to be forced into rote learning as a last resort, in the effort to continue to exclude Kreol and Bhojpuri.
Tendency to flaunt all pedagogical principles by creating an immense and useless social distance between the child's home and the school, by imposing a language hierarchy.
Tendency to increase the trauma of school and to and cause moral damage to children, and this, in turn; works to hamper full development during schooling, and even long after a child has left school.
Tendency to flaunt the basic pedagogical principle of starting with the known and moving to the unknown. Instead you encourage the ridiculous practice of using the unknown to learn the unknown.
Tendency to consciously increase the linguistic distance between teacher and books, on one hand, and the pupil, on the other.
Mr. Minister, you cannot just continue with the old colonial interpretation of language rights.
Your department must also begin to show a little respect for the science of linguistics, which has, for over fifty years now, proven that Kreol and Bhojpuri are the equals of any other language.
If you do not, you are showing disregard for the elementary rights of the child.
Some aspects of linguistic human rights are even already in the Mauritian Constitution and in the International Human Rights Conventions, even if they are, so far, still in an embryonic form.
It is in the spirit of all the human rights legislation that all human languages are "equal".
This is independent of their written status, the number of people who speak them, whether they are spoken or sign languages, or any other factor whatsoever.
We would like to point out that Kreol and Bhojpuri, incidentally, are amongst the "big" languages of the planet.
It is in this spirit of human rights that we must stop the colonial prejudice that allowed education to be dispensed in languages the children do not speak naturally.
Through generations of heroic struggles against colonization and through the struggle for Independence, we have gained a number of Constitutional Rights.
Section 12, for example, of the Constitution protects and guarantees our freedom of expression, which includes the right to receive and impart information and spread ideas and information without any interference. Using the wrong language is an impediment to free expression.
Internationally, the struggle for children to be free to learn through their maternal language has, so far, culminated in Article 13 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
This Convention, ratified by States including the Mauritian State (in 1990), assures children the right to education, and the freedom to seek, receive and spread information and ideas orally and in written and printed form without any discrimination.
Despite this, you continue in your discriminatory policy of blocking the children's use of their own language.
Sir, we remind you that in 1994, the United Nations Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ECOSOC) in its Report on Mauritius noted with concern that Kreol and Bhojpuri, the languages used by a vast majority of the population, were not being used in the Mauritian education system, and that the Government was actively discouraging the use of these languages in all its institutions.
Are you going to continue to flaunt the concern of this august body?
In 1996, the UN Human Rights Committee under the Convention on Civil and Political Rights in its Report on Mauritius recommended that measures be taken to at once begin to publish educational materials, especially for children, in the vernaculars, i.e. Kreol and Bhojpuri.
Your predecessors did nothing about this - with the notable exception of Mr. Kadress Pillay, who in the first draft of his Plan, did address the issue, but later capitulated.
Sir, you will remember that the May 1975 students strike was a rebellion whose main thrust was for the decolonization of education, and for the use of Kreol in schools.
The strike did have one positive effect, when it directly brought in free secondary education, but otherwise the degree of colonization in education is still overwhelming, especially as concerns the medium of instruction.
At the level of the African continent, the process of decolonization is more advanced. In 1987 the Language Plan of Action, initiated by the OUA (now incorporated into the African Union, one of its documents) spoke out for the use of African languages as official language and as medium in education.
Mauritius, which is a signatory to the Language Plan of Action, has an undertaking, therefore to introduce Kreol and Bhojpuri as medium.
But the Government has never respected its commitment.
Today you are announcing the construction of schools all over the country, which is a good thing, and you are imposing compulsory education, while at the same time continuing the measure of forcing a foreign medium on Kreolophone and Bhojpuri phone pupils.
Your actions make you act against the spirit of both the Constitution and the International Conventions adhered to by Mauritius. And of course, you continue to harm generations of children, generations of peoples.
Linguistic genocide.
The State is, in fact, hindering our people in the natural expression of our languages, Bhojpuri and Kreol. It is this that makes the Government responsible, through the schools in particular, for a crime against humanity, the crime of linguistic genocide. That is what we are accusing you of, Mr. Minister.
Any authority or any individual in a position of power that hinders a people in the natural expression of his language, is responsible for linguistic genocide, and we will explain exactly how. There are two instances. Firstly, linguistic genocide is when the State forces children to abandon the language of their parents, through, for example, a wrong language policy at school.
Government is forcing children to acquire additional languages in a way that is called "subtractive", and it is this "subtracting" of the natural language of our people, that causes the Government to be guilty of "linguistic genocide".
When we use the term "linguistic genocide", we are using United Nations definition on linguistic genocide, crime against humanity.
Children are learning the language that school teaches at the cost of the mother tongue and this represent linguistic genocide, because it is removing a child from his or her group (Kreolophone or Bhojpuriphone linguistic group) and placing him or her in a different linguistic group (Francophone or Anglophone).
Article II (e) of the United Nations Convention on Genocide reads: "Genocide is forcibly transferring children of a group to another group".
Government is forcibly transferring children from their own group to another linguistic group through education of children being dispensed in a dominant and foreign language, English and French, at the expense of their mother tongues, Bhojpuri and Kreol, as medium of education.
Linguistic genocide means prohibiting the use of language of the people, either in every day life, or as concerns us in this letter, in schools, or prohibiting the printing, circulation or publication in the language of the people.
Government is responsible for this "linguistic genocide" by refusing to prepare and publish books for school in Bhojpuri and Kreol.
Government is prohibiting the use of Bhojpuri and Kreol by failing to make it an official language, while imposing other official languages in school.
Bhojpuri and Kreol do not have official status nor political status and are not used as the principal medium in education.
Last year, Ledikasyon pu Travayer invited a linguist of international reputation, Prof. Tove Skutnabb-Kangas, to give a Public Lecture on this theme, and this is what she said: "If a child does not learn in his mother tongue and is forced to learn in a foreign language (what you are doing), this will do serious mental harm to the child."
Testimony in Mauritius.
Now we are going to take three examples in Mauritius, our country, where many intellectuals congratulate themselves that "we are a country of multi-lingual people", but who would do better to admit that your policies are making us a "country of demi-lingual people".
We hope that these three brief testimonies will help you and your advisors understand the gravity of your error, Minister Sir.
First testimony (woman now 30 years old):
In my family we all speak Kreol, and my mother and father never spoke French or English at home.
My father never went to school. He is a thinking and intelligent man, who can hold conversation in Kreol, English and French.
As if he is an example of "additive" apprenticeship of languages.
I went to school in Richelieu Cité for my first two school years, and every thing went well.
When my parents moved house to Port Louis, I had to change school.
This was upsetting, but inevitable.
One day, in Standard 3, I felt sick at school hours.
My tummy was sore.
I urgently needed to go to the toilet.
When I went to ask the teacher permission to go to the toilet, she said no because I must address her in French.
She told me that I would have to write 200 lines of "Je dois m'adresser a mon Miss an Francais."
That day, when I was not permitted to go to toilet, I defecated in my clothes.
For the next year, I was bullied and mocked for two things: that my French was poor and that I had "tata dan lenz".
My father was very angry and wanted to take me out of school.
And sometimes, until today I wonder if that would not have been better for me, because I remained miserable at school right through to college.
I am, like my father, self-taught, really.
2nd testimony (man now 43 years old):
In French,, when I was in Standard 6, the teacher (a man called Mr. I.D.) made us to this remarkable exercise, supposedly to develop our capacity to speak French with a good accent.
He made us put a pencil inside our mouths, cross-wise, like a horses' bit, and then read aloud.
With a pencil in your month like that you look like an animal being trained.
It was terrible exercise, it was violence against children.
3rd testimony (a child 11 years old now):
When I was in Standard I, my teacher told us that we must speak French so as to seek permission to go to toilet.
This made me unhappy in class.
These three testimonies show, to what extremes this "mental harm" can go.
But in fact, every day, when your policies serve to insult children's mother tongues, it, too, is extreme "mental harm" being caused.
Government is continuing to encourage English and French to be "killer languages" in Mauritius, instead of additional advantages.
English and French are the two biggest "killer languages" in the world.
In Mauritius too.
This is because of your policy to force children to learn these languages subtractively, i.e. at the cost of the mother tongue, rather than additively, i.e. in addition to the mother tongue.
Now that we are making this grave accusation against your policies, it will be clear to you that we are going to step up our campaign for the use of Kreol and Bhojpuri in schools, and for other languages to be introduced additively, so that we can put an end to this linguistic genocide.
Research and studies on medium and schooling.
Since 1953 UNESCO has publicly recognized that "It is axiomatic that the best medium for teaching a child is his (or her) mother tongue".
This UNESCO position is based on scientific research by expert pedagogues of international repute.
Right up today, UNESCO has continued re-affirming this position.
Recent studies have again and again continued to confirm the UNESCO stand. All thinking experts are in agreement.
Let us look at the major findings of the recent research.
1. All researchers agree that use of the mother tongue, especially in the first years of schooling, is unquestionably of benefit to the cognitive development of the child.
The conclusions of the research by Nadine Dutcher read: "The most important conclusion is that, when learning is the goal, including that of learning a second language, the child's first language should be used as the medium of instruction in the early years of schooling.”
For optimum results, the first language should be continued as the language of instruction through primary school.
If feasible, the first language of the student should be included among the subjects in secondary school when the language of instruction has changed.
The first language is essential for the initial teaching of reading, and for comprehension of subject matter.
2. Many researchers openly claim, and they almost all agree implicitly, that mother tongue education gives the child self-confidence and a stable identity.
Children are known to participate more and with more enthusiasm in class if the mother tongue is used.
The degree of personal assurance and critical engagement with teachers is greater.
Studies in 64 different classes in Mozambique in 1997 and in two Provinces of Bolivia where children speak Quechua have confirmed this.
3. Development at school in the mother tongue helps in the acquisition of new languages.
The research shows that if children are forced to learn through a language that they are not at ease in or do not master, that they suffer immense disadvantages and that the disadvantage can almost never be compensated for later.
The clearest study is that of David Ramirez in the USA.
He did an eight-year longitudinal study, 1983 to 1991 in 51 different primary schools in the States of California, Texas, Florida, New York and New Jersey.
In all 2,000 students whose mother tongue was Spanish took part in the study, which also involved their parents.
The aim was to compare three groups of children relative to how they were using Spanish and English in education.
The primary schools where the studies were conducted were divided into 3 categories:
(i) Where at school the children were taught entirely through English;
(ii) Where at school the children had up to 40 minutes a day until the end of the second or 3rd year of primary school;
(iii) Where at school the mother tongue was used as medium for at least 40% of the time every day until the end of 6th year of primary school.
This study showed that the longer the mother tongue was used, the better the child performed academically.
Those who learnt through the mother tongue until the 6th Standard did much better than the other two groups, even in the English language itself. The children not only caught up with the Anglophone children, but tended to do better than them.
See attached graph.
Other studies in Haiti, for example show that Creolophone children who learnt through Haitian Creole in school developed a better competence in French, their 2nd language, than those who learnt through French, plus naturally they did better in cognition and other non-language subjects.
What the studies show is that the development of a child's mother tongue is more important for later acquisition of a second language, than using a second language for teaching.
Many people used to think that using the medium of a second language (say English or French) was an advantage, and that the earlier this started the better.
But all the studies only go to prove that this was a myth.
A harmful myth at that.
A famous study in Nigeria showed that children who speak Yoruba and who were taught through their mother tongue from 1st to 6th Standard do much better than the children taught through English, in all subjects, including in English.
We read the same results from a study by the Guatemala National Program for Bilingual Education. Children taught in their mother tongue have a better performance in all subjects including second language learning.
An example from Papua New Guinea
The population in Papua New Guinea is around 5 million, and it is the country, which has the highest number of languages in the world.
There are more than 850 different languages. Before, education was mostly through the medium of English.
But, there has been a great development, and during the year 2002, education in the pre-school, and the first two classes in school were made in 470 languages.
Not 2, as we are asking, Kreol and Bhojpuri, but 470.
Papua New Guinea is not one of the richest countries in the world.
What are the results?
They started this experiment in 1993, or 10 years ago.
I will read the results from David Klaus's study.
Children become literate more quickly, and easily.
They learn English very quickly and easily than their siblings did under the old English-medium system.
They do not drop out.
Children including girls stay in school.
After the first six years, the children have an obligatory examination.
In those provinces, which started first in 1993, children who had mother tongue media education had much higher results, in the end-examination, in English, than those provinces, which still taught, through the medium of English from Day I.
A comparison from neighbouring countries, Zambia and Malawi.
There is an example from Zambia and Malawi, according to a study made by Edward Williams where there was a study with 1,500 children in grades I-VII, from 6 to 14 years.
The study showed that all the Zambian children were educated through the medium of English. The study concludes that there was large numbers of Zambian children (all educated in English) have very weak or zero reading competence in 2 languages.
In Malawi the children were taught in various local languages, which were mostly there mother tongues.
During the first four years of school they had English as a subject, and from fifth year they started learning all in English.
When Edward Williams compared their English language competence to that of the Zambian children, he could see that the Malawi students had a better test result in English that the Zambian students.
Statistics on Languages usually spoken in Mauritius
These figures show the extent of the use of Kreol and Bhojpuri.
Whereas in 1990, 70.6 % people said they speak Kreol or Kreol & another language, in 2000 80.5% said so.
In 2000 those who say they speak Kreol and Bhojpuri has progressed from 91. 8 to 93.2%.
Only 5% of the population even claims the high status languages English, French and Other Oriental Languages.
What Ledikasyon pu Travayer proposes.
Ledikasyon pu Travayer, says that the Ministry of Education must stop murdering the intelligence of children.
We propose that the Ministry of Education once and for all begins to use the mother tongue of children, Kreol and Bhojpuri, as the medium of education.
Ledikasyon pu Travayer is proposing that all necessary measured be taken for the gradual introduction of Kreol and Bhojpuri as medium from 2004.
We propose that the Minister of Education organizes a series of "National translation Competitions" for all the textbooks used. Government must offer prizes of (Rs 100,000 or more) to the teacher who does the best translation of each text into Kreol and Bhojpuri.
We propose that the Minister of Education offers Kreol and Bhojpuri language as a subject as from when children go to primary school.
Ledikasyon pu Travayer proposes that government recruit a group of professional linguists with experience to draft a full-length Mauritian Kreol grammar, and to continue to develop the scientific study of the Kreol language.
The same thing for Bhojpuri.
We propose that government create a Department for the Study of the Kreol language, and another Department for the study of Bhojpuri at the University, MIE, MCA, MES.
The fact that many teachers, through their trade unions have already taken a stand in favour of the introduction of the Kreol language as medium of instruction, the fact that many teachers already use the mother tongue when they are teaching children because it is most efficient means that the co-operation of teachers can be expected.
This change will also permit parents to contribute to the education of their child.
A second type of genocide.
In conclusion, we would like to draw your attention to another serious problem once schooling has become compulsory.
Till today, there are many regions where there is only an RCEA primary school and no government school.
This means, if we understand Government's position, that an education of a religious "specificity" is dispensed.
Once you make it legally compulsory for parents to send their children to school, how can you force parents in Tamarin or St Pierre (or any number of other areas) to send their children to have religiously "specific" education dispensed? This will, we are obliged to inform you, be another form of genocide, this time based on transferring children from one religious group to another.
As you can see, once schooling becomes compulsory, you as Minister have additional responsibilities not to hard children.
You are legally and morally bound to build secular schools in all areas.
If not, you will be liable to pay reparations for genocide.
And, more importantly, you will be responsible for an immense harm done to children.
You must, as from now, since we have made you aware of the problem of linguistic genocide, immediately make preparations to introduce the mother tongues as medium in schools.
We hope that you will immediately start a process to put a stop to the persistence of these colonial policies, which have gone on too long.
We wish to assure you that we in Ledikasyon pu Travayer will continue the fight for the liberation of children from the domination you are continuing to impose on them.

Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the popholes.
With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.
As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a fluttering all through the farm buildings.
Word had gone round during the day that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strange dream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals.
It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as Mr. Jones was safely out of the way.
Old Major (so he was always called, though the name under which he had been exhibited was Willingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an hour’s sleep in order to hear what he had to say.
At one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was already ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam.
He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he was still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut.
Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their different fashions.
First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw immediately in front of the platform.
The hens perched themselves on the window-sills, the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud.
The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in the straw.
Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal.
Boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together.
A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work.
After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey.
Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered.
He seldom talked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical remark for instance, he would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies.
Alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed.
If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at.
Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer.
The two of them usually spent their Sundays together in the small paddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking.
The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which had lost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering from side to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on.
Clover made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep.
At the last moment Mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who drew Mr. Jones’s trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of sugar.
She took a place near the front and began flirting her white mane, hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with.
Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer and Clover; there she purred contentedly throughout Major’s speech without listening to a word of what he was saying.
All the animals were now present except Moses, the tame raven, who slept on a perch behind the back door.
When Major saw that they had all made themselves comfortable and were waiting attentively, he cleared his throat and began:
Comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that I had last night.
But I will come to the dream later.
I have something else to say first.
I do not think, comrades, that I shall be with you for many months longer, and before I die, I feel it my duty to pass on to you such wisdom as I have acquired.
I have had a long life, I have had much time for thought as I lay alone in my stall, and I think I may say that I understand the nature of life on this earth as well as any animal now living.
It is about this that I wish to speak to you.
Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours?
Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short.
We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty.
No animal in England knows the meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old.
No animal in England is free.
The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth.
But is this simply part of the order of nature?
Is it because this land of ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell upon it?
No, comrades, a thousand times no!
The soil of England is fertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in abundance to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it.
This single farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that are now almost beyond our imagining.
Why then do we continue in this miserable condition?
Because nearly the whole of the produce of our labour is stolen from us by human beings.
There, comrades, is the answer to all our problems.
It is summed up in a single word: Man.
Man is the only real enemy we have.
Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever.
Man is the only creature that consumes without producing.
He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits.
Yet he is lord of all the animals.
He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.
Our labour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin.
You cows that I see before me, how many thousands of gallons of milk have you given during this last year?
And what has happened to that milk which should have been breeding up sturdy calves?
Every drop of it has gone down the throats of our enemies.
And you hens, how many eggs have you laid in this last year, and how many of those eggs ever hatched into chickens?
The rest have all gone to market to bring in money for Jones and his men.
And you, Clover, where are those four foals you bore, who should have been the support and pleasure of your old age?
Each was sold at a year old you will never see one of them again.
In return for your four confinements and all your labour in the fields, what have you ever had except your bare rations and a stall?
And even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their natural span.
For myself I do not grumble, for I am one of the lucky ones.
I am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children.
Such is the natural life of a pig.
But no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end.
You young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one of you will scream your lives out at the block within a year.
To that horror we all must come: cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone.
Even the horses and the dogs have no better fate.
You, Boxer, the very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will sell you to the knacker, who will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds.
As for the dogs, when they grow old and toothless, Jones ties a brick round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond.
Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings?
Only get rid of Man, and the produce of our labour would be our own.
Almost overnight we could become rich and free.
What then must we do?
Why, work night and day, body and soul, for the overthrow of the human race!
That is my message to you, comrades: Rebellion!
I do not know when that Rebellion will come, it might be in a week or in a hundred years, but I know, as surely as I see this straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice will be done.
Fix your eyes on that, comrades, throughout the short remainder of your lives!
And above all, pass on this message of mine to those who come after you, so that future generations shall carry on the struggle until it is victorious.
And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter.
No argument must lead you astray.
Never listen when they tell you that Man and the animals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others.
It is all lies.
Man serves the interests of no creature except himself.
And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle.
All men are enemies.
All animals are comrades.
At this moment there was a tremendous uproar.
While Major was speaking four large rats had crept out of their holes and were sitting on their hindquarters, listening to him.
The dogs had suddenly caught sight of them, and it was only by a swift dash for their holes that the rats saved their lives.
Major raised his trotter for silence.
Comrades, he said, here is a point that must be settled.
The wild creatures, such as rats and rabbits are they our friends or our enemies?
Let us put it to the vote.
I propose this question to the meeting: Are rats comrades?
The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming majority that rats were comrades.
There were only four dissentients, the three dogs and the cat, who was afterwards discovered to have voted on both sides.
Major continued:
I have little more to say.
I merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards Man and all his ways.
Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to resemble him.
Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices.
No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade.
All the habits of Man are evil.
And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind.
Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers.
No animal must ever kill any other animal.
All animals are equal.
And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night.
I cannot describe that dream to you.
It was a dream of the earth as it will be when Man has vanished.
But it reminded me of something that I had long forgotten.
Many years ago, when I was small, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words.
I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind.
Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream.
And what is more, the words of the song also came back  words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations.
I will sing you that song now, comrades.
I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves.
It is called Beasts of England.
Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing.
As he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something between Clementine and La Cucaracha.
The words ran:
Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland, Beasts of every land and clime, listen to my joyful tidings Of the golden future time.
Almost before Major had reached the end, they had begun singing it for themselves.
Even the stupidest of them had already picked up the tune and a few of the words, and as for the clever ones, such as the pigs and dogs, they had the entire song by heart within a few minutes.
And then, after a few preliminary tries, the whole farm burst out into Beasts of England in tremendous unison.
The cows loved it, the dogs whined it, the sheep bleated it, the horses whinnied it, the ducks quacked it.
They were so delighted with the song that they sang it right through five times in succession, and might have continued singing it all night if they had not been interrupted.
Unfortunately, the uproar awoke Mr. Jones, who sprang out of bed, making sure that there was a fox in the yard.
He seized the gun which always stood in a corner of his bedroom, and let fly a charge of number 6 shot into the darkness.
The pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barn and the meeting broke up hurriedly.
Everyone fled to his own sleeping-place.
The birds jumped on to their perches, the animals settled down in the straw, and the whole farm was asleep in a moment.
Three nights later old Major died peacefully in his sleep.
His body was buried at the foot of the orchard.
This was early in March.
During the next three months there was much secret activity.
Major’s speech had given to the more intelligent animals on the farm a completely new outlook on life.
They did not know when the Rebellion predicted by Major would take place, they had no reason for thinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly that it was their duty to prepare for it.
The work of teaching and organising the others fell naturally upon the pigs, who were generally recognised as being the cleverest of the animals.
Pre-eminent among the pigs were two young boars named Snowball and Napoleon, whom Mr. Jones was breeding up for sale.
Napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way.
Snowball was a more vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character.
All the other male pigs on the farm were porkers.
The best known among them was a small fat pig named Squealer, with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a shrill voice.
He was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail which was somehow very persuasive.
The others said of Squealer that he could turn black into white.
These three had elaborated old Major’s teachings into a complete system of thought, to which they gave the name of Animalism.
Several nights a week, after Mr. Jones was asleep, they held secret meetings in the barn and expounded the principles of Animalism to the others.
At the beginning they met with much stupidity and apathy.
Some of the animals talked of the duty of loyalty to Mr. Jones, whom they referred to as Master, or made elementary remarks such as Mr. Jones feeds us.
If he were gone, we should starve to death.
Others asked such questions as why should we care what happens after we are dead?
or â€˜If this Rebellion is to happen anyway, what difference does it make whether we work for it or not?
The pigs had great difficulty in making them see that this was contrary to the spirit of Animalism.
The stupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie, the white mare.
The very first question she asked Snowball was: will there still be sugar after the Rebellion?
No, said Snowball firmly.
We have no means of making sugar on this farm.
You will have all the oats and hay you want.
And shall I still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane? asked Mollie.
Comrade, said Snowball, those ribbons that you are so devoted to are the badge of slavery.
Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than ribbons?
Mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced.
The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by Moses, the tame raven.
Moses, who was Mr. Jones’s especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker.
He claimed to know of the existence of a mysterious country called Sugarcandy Mountain, to which all animals went when they died.
It was situated somewhere up in the sky, a little distance beyond the clouds, Moses said.
In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges.
The animals hated Moses because he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed in Sugarcandy Mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place.
Their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover.
These two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves, but having once accepted the pigs as their teachers, they absorbed everything that they were told, and passed it on to the other animals by simple arguments.
They were unfailing in their attendance at the secret meetings in the barn, and led the singing of Beasts of England, with which the meetings always ended.
Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier and more easily than anyone had expected.
In past years Mr. Jones, although a hard master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days.
He had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit, and had taken to drinking more than was good for him.
For whole days at a time he would lounge in his Windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers, drinking, and occasionally feeding Moses on crusts of bread soaked in beer.
His men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed.
June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting.
On Midsummer’s Eve, which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and got so drunk at the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday.
The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals.
When Mr. Jones got back he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the News of the World over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed.
At last they could stand it no longer.
One of the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with her horn and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins.
It was just then that Mr. Jones woke up.
The next moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions.
This was more than the hungry animals could bear.
With one accord, though nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors.
Jones and his men suddenly found themselves being butted and kicked from all sides.
The situation was quite out of their control.
They had never seen animals behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them almost out of their wits.
After only a moment or two they gave up trying to defend themselves and took to their heels.
A minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph.
Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening, hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way.
Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking loudly.
Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out on to the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them.
And so, almost before they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfully carried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.
For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune.
Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it.
Then they raced back to the farm buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones’s hated reign.
The harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives with which Mr. Jones had been used to castrate the animals, were all flung down the well.
The whips also went into the fire.
All the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames.
Snowball also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses’ manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.
Ribbons, he said, should be considered as clothes, which are the mark of a human being.
All animals should go naked.
When Boxer heard this he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in summer to keep the flies out of his ears, and flung it on to the fire with the rest.
In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that reminded them of Mr. Jones.
Napoleon then led them back to the store-shed and served out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for each dog.
Then they sang Beasts of England from end to end seven times running, and after that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before.
But they woke at dawn as usual, and suddenly remembering the glorious thing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture together.
A little way down the pasture there was a knoll that commanded a view of most of the farm.
The animals rushed to the top of it and gazed round them in the clear morning light.
Yes, it was theirs everything that they could see was theirs!
In the ecstasy of that thought they gambolled round and round, they hurled themselves into the air in great leaps of excitement. They rolled in the dew, they cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass, they kicked up clods of the black earth and snuffed its rich scent.
Then they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm.
They surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney.
It was as though they had never seen these things before, and even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own.
Then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence outside the door of the farmhouse.
That was theirs too, but they were frightened to go inside.
After a moment, however, Snowball and Napoleon butted the door open with their shoulders and the animals entered in single file, walking with the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything.
They tiptoed from room to room, afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kind of awe at the unbelievable luxury, at the beds with their feather mattresses, the looking-glasses, the horsehair sofa, the Brussels carpet, the lithograph of Queen Victoria over the drawing-room mantelpiece.
They were just coming down the stairs when Mollie was discovered to be missing.
Going back, the others found that she had remained behind in the best bedroom.
She had taken a piece of blue ribbon from Mrs. Jones’s dressing-table, and was holding it against her shoulder and admiring herself in the glass in a very foolish manner.
The others reproached her sharply, and they went outside.
Some hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out for burial, and the barrel of beer in the scullery was stove in with a kick from Boxer’s hoof, otherwise nothing in the house was touched.
A unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse should be preserved as a museum.
All were agreed that no animal must ever live there.
The animals had their breakfast, and then Snowball and Napoleon called them together again.
Comrades, said Snowball, it is half-past six and we have a long day before us.
Today we begin the hay harvest.
But there is another matter that must be attended to first.
The pigs now revealed that during the past three months they had taught themselves to read and write from an old spelling book which had belonged to Mr. Jones’s children and which had been thrown on the rubbish heap.
Napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led the way down to the five-barred gate that gave on to the main road.
Then Snowball (for it was Snowball who was best at writing) took a brush between the two knuckles of his trotter, painted out MANOR FARM from the top bar of the gate and in its place painted ANIMAL FARM.
This was to be the name of the farm from now onwards.
After this they went back to the farm buildings, where Snowball and Napoleon sent for a ladder which they caused to be set against the end wall of the big barn.
They explained that by their studies of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles of Animalism to Seven Commandments.
These Seven Commandments would now be inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all the animals on Animal Farm must live for ever after.
With some difficulty (for it is not easy for a pig to balance himself on a ladder) Snowball climbed up and set to work, with Squealer a few rungs below him holding the paint-pot.
The Commandments were written on the tarred wall in great white letters that could be read thirty yards away.
They ran thus:
THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS
1 Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
2 Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
3 No animal shall wear clothes.
4 No animal shall sleep in a bed.
5 No animal shall drink alcohol.
6 No animal shall kill any other animal.
7 All animals are equal.
It was very neatly written, and except that friend was written freind and one of the S’s was the wrong way round, the spelling was correct all the way through.
Snowball read it aloud for ‎the benefit of the others.
All the animals nodded in complete agreement, and the cleverer ones at once began to learn the Commandments by heart.
Now, comrades, cried Snowball, throwing down the paint-brush, to the hayfield! Let us make it a point of honour to get in the harvest more quickly than Jones and his men could do.
But at this moment the three cows, who had seemed uneasy for some time past, set up a loud lowing.
They had not been milked for twenty-four hours, and their udders were almost bursting.
After a little thought, the pigs sent for buckets and milked the cows fairly successfully, their trotters being well adapted to this task.
Soon there were five buckets of frothing creamy milk at which many of the animals looked with considerable interest.
What is going to happen to all that milk? said someone.
Jones used sometimes to mix some of it in our mash, said one of the hens.
Never mind the milk, comrades! cried Napoleon, placing himself in front of the buckets.
That will be attended to.
The harvest is more important.
Comrade Snowball will lead the way.
I shall follow in a few minutes.
Forward, comrades! The hay is waiting.
So the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest, and when they came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared.
How they toiled and sweated to get the hay in!
But their efforts were rewarded, for the harvest was an even bigger success than they had hoped.
Sometimes the work was hard; the tools had been designed for human beings and not for animals, and it was a great drawback that no animal was able to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs.
But the pigs were so clever that they could think of a way round every difficulty.
As for the horses, they knew every inch of the field, and in fact understood the business of mowing and raking far better than Jones and his men had ever done.
The pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the others.
With their superior knowledge it was natural that they should assume the leadership.
In the end they finished the harvest in two days less time than it had usually taken Jones and his men.
Moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen.
There was no wastage whatever;
The hens and ducks with their sharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk.
And not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful.
All through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork.
The animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be.
Every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was truly their own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled out to them by a grudging master.
With the worthless parasitical human beings gone, there was more for everyone to eat.
There was more leisure too, inexperienced though the animals were.
Boxer was the admiration of everybody.
He had been a hard worker even in Jones’s time, but now he seemed more like three horses than one; there were days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest on his mighty shoulders.
From morning to night he was pushing and pulling, always at the spot where the work was hardest.
He had made an arrangement with one of the cockerels to call him in the mornings half an hour earlier than anyone else, and would put in some volunteer labour at whatever seemed to be most needed, before the regular day’s work began.
His answer to every problem, every setback, was I will work harder! which he had adopted as his personal motto.
But everyone worked according to his capacity.
The hens and ducks, for instance, saved five bushels of corn at the harvest by gathering up the stray grains.
Nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his rations, the quarrelling and biting and jealousy which had been normal features of life in the old days had almost disappeared.
Nobody shirked or almost nobody.
Mollie, it was true, was not good at getting up in the mornings, and had a way of leaving work early on the ground that there was a stone in her hoof.
And the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar.
It was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found.
She would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or in the evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened.
But she always made such excellent excuses, and purred so affectionately, that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions.
Old Benjamin, the donkey, seemed quite unchanged since the Rebellion.
He did his work in the same slow obstinate way as he had done it in Jones’s time, never shirking and never volunteering for extra work either.
About the Rebellion and its results he would express no opinion.
When asked whether he was not happier now that Jones was gone, he would say only Donkeys live a long time.
None of you has ever seen a dead donkey, and the others had to be content with this cryptic answer.
On Sundays there was no work.
Breakfast was an hour later than usual, and after breakfast there was a ceremony which was observed every week without fail.
First came the hoisting of the flag.
Snowball had found in the harness-room an old green tablecloth of Mrs. Jones’s and had painted on it a hoof and a horn in white.
This was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse garden every Sunday, morning.
The flag was green, Snowball explained, to represent the green fields of England, while the hoof and horn signified the future Republic of the Animals which would arise when the human race had been finally overthrown.
After the hoisting of the flag all the animals trooped into the big barn for a general assembly which was known as the Meeting.
Here the work of the coming week was planned out and resolutions were put forward and debated.
It was always the pigs who put forward the resolutions.
The other animals understood how to vote, but could never think of any resolutions of their own.
Snowball and Napoleon were by far the most active in the debates.
But it was noticed that these two were never in agreement: whatever suggestion either of them made, the other could be counted on to oppose it.
Even when it was resolved a thing no one could object to in itself to set aside the small paddock behind the orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work, there was a stormy debate over the correct retiring age for each class of animal.
The Meeting always ended with the singing of Beasts of England, and the afternoon was given up to recreation.
The pigs had set aside the harness-room as a headquarters for themselves. Here, in the evenings, they studied blacksmithing, carpentering, and other necessary arts from books which they had brought out of the farmhouse.
Snowball also busied himself with organising the other animals into what he called Animal Committees.
He was indefatigable at this.
He formed the Egg Production Committee for the hens, the Clean Tails League for the cows, the Wild Comrades Re-education Committee (the object of this was to tame the rats and rabbits), the Whiter Wool Movement for the sheep, and various others, besides instituting classes in reading and writing.
On the whole, these projects were a failure.
The attempt to tame the wild creatures, for instance, broke down almost immediately.
They continued to behave very much as before, and when treated with generosity, simply took advantage of it.
The cat joined the Re-education Committee and was very active in it for some days.
She was seen one day sitting on a roof and talking to some sparrows who were just out of her reach.
She was telling them that all animals were now comrades and that any sparrow who chose could come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept their distance.
The reading and writing classes, however, were a great success.
After a few months, almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree.
As for the pigs, they could already read and write perfectly.
The dogs learned to read fairly well, but were not interested in reading anything except the Seven Commandments.
Muriel, the goat, could read somewhat better than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the others in the evenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap.
Benjamin could read as well as any pig, but never exercised his faculty.
So far as he knew, he said, there was nothing worth reading.
Clover learnt the whole alphabet, but could not put words together.
Boxer could learn A, B, C, D.
In the dust with his great hoof, and then would stand staring at the letters with his ears back, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with all his might to remember what came next and never succeeding.
On several occasions, indeed, he did learn E, F, G, H, but by the time he knew them, it was always discovered that he had forgotten A, B, C, and D.
Finally he decided to be content with the first four letters, and used to write them out once or twice every day to refresh his memory.
Mollie refused to learn any but the six letters which spelt her own name.
She would form these very neatly out of pieces of twig, and would then decorate them with a flower or two and walk round them admiring them.
None of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter A.
It was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens, and ducks, were unable to learn the Seven Commandments by heart.
After much thought Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could in effect be reduced to a single maxim, namely: Four legs good, two legs bad.
This, he said, contained the essential principle of Animalism.
Whoever had thoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences.
The birds at first objected, since it seemed to them that they also had two legs, but Snowball proved to them that this was not so.
A bird’s wing, comrades, he said, is an organ of propulsion and not of manipulation. It should therefore be regarded as a leg.
The distinguishing mark of man is the hand, the instrument with which he does all his mischief.
The birds did not understand Snowball’s long words, but they accepted his explanation, and all the humbler animals set to work to learn the new maxim by heart.
FOUR LEGS GOOD, TWO LEGS BAD, was inscribed on the end wall of the barn, above the Seven Commandments and in bigger letters.
When they had once got it by heart, the sheep developed a great liking for this maxim, and often as they lay in the field they would all start bleating Four legs good, two legs bad!
Four legs good, two legs bad! and keep it up for hours on end, never growing tired of it.
Napoleon took no interest in Snowball’s committees.
He said that the education of the young was more important than anything that could be done for those who were already grown up.
It happened that Jessie and Bluebell had both helped soon after the hay harvest, giving birth between them to nine sturdy puppies.
As soon as they were weaned, Napoleon took them away from their mothers, saying that he would make himself responsible for their education.
He took them up into a loft which could only be reached by a ladder from the harness-room, and there kept them in such seclusion that the rest of the farm soon forgot their existence.
After some time other animals completely forgot about their existence.
It was mixed every day into the pigs’ mash.
The early apples were now ripening, and the grass of the orchard was littered with windfalls.
The animals had assumed as a matter of course that these would be shared out equally;
one day, however, the order went forth that all the windfalls were to be collected and brought to the harness-room for the use of the pigs.
At this some of the other animals murmured, but it was no use.
All the pigs were in full agreement on this point, even Snowball and Napoleon.
Squealer was sent to make the necessary explanations to the others.
Comrades! he cried. You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege?
Many of us actually dislike milk and apples.
I dislike them myself.
Our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health.
Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig.
He makes our brains work well so that we can take care of the animal farm as needed; so that we can look after them soon.
By the late summer the news of what had happened on Animal Farm had spread across half the county.
Every day Snowball and Napoleon sent out flights of pigeons whose instructions were to mingle with the animals on neighbouring farms, tell them the story of the Rebellion, and teach them the tune of Beasts of England.
Most of this time Mr. Jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the Red Lion at Willingdon, complaining to anyone who would listen of the monstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property by a pack of good-for-nothing animals.
The other farmers sympathised in principle, but they did not at first give him much help.
At heart, each of them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn Jones’ misfortune to his own advantage.
It was lucky that the owners of the two farms which adjoined Animal Farm were on permanently bad terms.
One of them, which was named Foxwood, was a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm, much overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition.
Its owner, Mr. Pilkington, was an easy-going gentleman farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting according to the season.
The other farm, which was called Pinchfield, was smaller and better kept.
Its owner was a Mr. Frederick, a tough, shrewd man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains.
These two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.
Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on Animal Farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning too much about it.
At first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of animals managing a farm for themselves.
The whole thing would be over in a fortnight, they said.
They put it about that the animals on the Manor Farm (they insisted on calling it the Manor Farm; they would not tolerate the name Animal Farm were perpetually fighting among themselves and were also rapidly starving to death.
When time passed and the animals had evidently not starved to death, Frederick and Pilkington changed their tune and began to talk of the terrible wickedness that now flourished on Animal Farm.
It was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism, tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in common.
This was what came of rebelling against the laws of Nature, Frederick and Pilkington said.
However, these stories were never fully believed.
Rumours of a wonderful farm, where the human beings had been turned out and the animals managed their own affairs, continued to circulate in vague and distorted forms, and throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through the countryside.
Bulls which had always been tractable suddenly turned savage, sheep broke down hedges and devoured the clover, cows kicked the pail over, hunters refused their fences and shot their riders on to the other side.
Above all, the tune and even the words of Beasts of England were known everywhere.
It had spread with astonishing speed.
The human beings could not contain their rage when they heard this song, though they pretended to think it merely ridiculous.
They could not understand, they said, how even animals could bring themselves to sing such contemptible rubbish.
Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot.
And yet the song was irrepressible.
The blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells.
And when the human beings listened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom.
Early in October, when the corn was cut and stacked and some of it was already threshed, a flight of pigeons came whirling through the air and alighted in the yard of Animal Farm in the wildest excitement.
Jones and all his men, with half a dozen others from Foxwood and Pinchfield, had entered the five-barred gate and were coming up the cart-track that led to the farm.
They were all carrying sticks, except Jones, who was marching ahead with a gun in his hands. Obviously they were going to attempt the recapture of the farm.
This had long been expected, and all preparations had been made.
Snowball, who had studied an old book of Julius Caesar’s campaigns which he had found in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive operations.
He gave his orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at his post.
As the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball launched his first attack.
All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over the men’s heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs.
However, this was only a light skirmishing manoeuvre, intended to create a little disorder, and the men easily drove the geese off with their sticks.
Snowball now launched his second line of attack.
Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, with Snowball at the head of them, rushed forward and prodded and butted the men from every side, while Benjamin turned around and lashed at them with his small hoofs.
But once again the men, with their sticks and their hobnailed boots, were too strong for them; and suddenly, at a squeal from Snowball, which was the signal for retreat.
All the animals turned and fled through the gateway into the yard.
The men gave a shout of triumph.
They saw, as they imagined, their enemies in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder.
This was just what Snowball had intended.
As soon as they were well inside the yard, the three horses, the three cows, and the rest of the pigs, who had been lying in ambush in the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting them off.
Snowball now gave the signal for the charge.
He himself dashed straight for Jones.
Jones saw him coming, raised his gun and fired.
The pellets scored bloody streaks along Snowball’s back, and a sheep dropped dead.
Without halting for an instant, Snowball flung his fifteen stone against Jones’s legs. Jones was hurled into a pile of dung and his gun flew out of his hands.
But the most terrifying spectacle of all was Boxer, rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion.
His very first blow took a stable-lad from Foxwood on the skull and stretched him lifeless in the mud.
At the sight, several men dropped their sticks and tried to run.
Panic overtook them, and the next moment all the animals together were chasing them round and round the yard.
There was not an animal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own fashion.
Even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman’s shoulders and sank her claws in his neck.
It had to hear him yelled horribly.
At a moment when the opening was clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main road.
All the men were gone except one.
Back in the yard Boxer was pawing with his hoof at the stable-lad who lay face down in the mud, trying to turn him over.
The boy did not stir.
He is dead, said Boxer sorrowfully.
I had no intention of doing that.
I forgot that I was wearing iron shoes.
Who will believe that I did not do this on purpose?
No sentimentality, comrade! cried Snowball from whose wounds the blood was still dripping.
War is war.
The only good human being is a dead one.
I have no wish to take life, not even human life, repeated Boxer, and his eyes were full of tears.
Where is Mollie? exclaimed somebody.
Mollie in fact was missing.
For a moment there was great alarm;
it was feared that the men might have harmed her in some way, or even carried her off with them.
In the end, however, she was found hiding in her stall with her head buried among the hay in the manger.
She had taken to flight as soon as the gun went off.
And when the others came back from looking for her, it was to find that the stable-lad, who in fact was only stunned, had already recovered and made off.
The animals had now reassembled in the wildest excitement, each recounting his own exploits in the battle at the top of his voice.
An impromptu celebration of the victory was held immediately.
The flag was run up and Beasts of England was sung a number of times, then the sheep who had been killed was given a solemn funeral, a hawthorn bush being planted on her grave.
At the graveside Snowball made a little speech, emphasising the need for all animals to be ready to die for Animal Farm if need be.
The animals decided unanimously to create a military decoration, Animal Hero, First Class, which was conferred there and then on Snowball and Boxer.
It consisted of a brass medal (they were really some old horse-brasses which had been found in the harness-room), to be worn on Sundays and holidays.
There was also Animal Hero, Second Class, which was conferred posthumously on the dead sheep.
There was much discussion as to what the battle should be called. In the end, it was named the Battle of the Cowshed, since that was where the ambush had been sprung.
Mr. Jones’s gun had been found lying in the mud, and it was known that there was a supply of cartridges in the farmhouse.
It was decided to set the gun up at the foot of the Flagstaff, like a piece of artillery, and to fire it twice a year once on October the twelfth, the anniversary of the Battle of the Cowshed, and once on Midsummer Day, the anniversary of the Rebellion.
As winter drew on, Mollie became more and more troublesome.
She was late for work every morning and excused herself by saying that she had overslept, and she complained of mysterious pains, although her appetite was excellent.
On every kind of pretext she would run away from work and go to the drinking pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her own reflection in the water.
But there were also rumours of something more serious.
One day, as Mollie strolled blithely into the yard, flirting her long tail and chewing at a stalk of hay, Clover took her aside.
Mollie,she said, I have something very serious to say to you.
This morning I saw you looking over the hedge that divides Animal Farm from Foxwood.
One of Mr. Pilkington’s men was standing on the other side of the hedge.
And I was a long way away, but I am alvmost certain I saw this he was talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose.
What does that mean, Mollie?
It isn’t true! cried Mollie, beginning to prance about and paw the ground.
Mollie, Look at me in the face.
Do you give me your word of honour that that man was not stroking your nose?
It isn’t true! repeated Mollie.
but she could not look Clover in the face, and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the field.
A thought struck Clover.
Without saying anything to the others, she went to Mollie’s stall and turned over the straw with her hoof.
Hidden under the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of different colours.
Three days later Mollie disappeared.
For some weeks nothing was known of her whereabouts, then the pigeons reported that they had seen her on the other side of Willingdon.
In January there came bitterly hard weather.
The earth was like iron, and nothing could be done in the fields.
Many meetings were held in the big barn, and the pigs occupied themselves with planning out the work of the coming season.
It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were manifestly cleverer than the other animals, should decide all questions of farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote.
This arrangement would have worked well enough if it had not been for the disputes between Snowball and Napoleon.
These two disagreed at every point where disagreement was possible.
If one of them suggested sowing barley, the other was certain to demand a bigger acreage of oats, and if one of them said that such and such a field was just right for cabbages, the other would declare that it was useless for anything except potato.
Each had his own following, and there were some violent debates.
At the Meetings Snowball often won over the majority by his brilliant speeches, but Napoleon was better at canvassing support for himself in between times.
He was especially successful with the sheep.
Of late the sheep had taken to bleating Four legs good, two legs bad.
Napoleon produced no schemes of his own, but said quietly that Snowball’s would come to nothing, and seemed to be biding his time.
In the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a small knoll which was the highest point on the farm.
After surveying the ground, Snowball declared that this was just the place for a windmill, which could be made to operate a dynamo and supply the farm with electrical power.
This would light the stalls and warm them in winter, and would also run a circular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer, and an electric milking machine.
The animals had never heard of anything of this kind before, for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only the most primitive machinery), and they listened in astonishment while Snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds with reading and conversation.
Within a few weeks Snowball’s plans for the windmill were fully worked out.
Gradually the plans grew into a complicated mass of cranks and cog-wheels, covering more than half the floor, which the other animals found completely unintelligible but very impressive.
The whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill.
Snowball did not deny that to build it would be a difficult business.
Stone would have to be carried and built up into walls, then the sails would have to be made and after that there would be need for dynamos and cables.
How these were to be procured, Snowball did not say.
But he maintained that it could all be done in a year.
And thereafter, he declared, so much labour would be saved that the animals would only need to work three days a week.
Napoleon, on the other hand, argued that the great need of the moment was to increase food production, and that if they wasted time on the windmill they would all starve to death.
The animals formed themselves into two factions under the slogan, vote for Snowball and the three-day week and vote for Napoleon and the full manager.
Benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction.
He refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would save work.
Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on that is, badly.
Apart from the disputes over the windmill, there was the question of the defence of the farm.
It was fully realised that though the human beings had been defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed they might make another and more determined attempt to recapture the farm and reinstate Mr. Jones. They had all the more reason for doing so because the news of their defeat had spread across the countryside and made the animals on the neighbouring farms more restive than ever.
As usual, Snowball and Napoleon were in disagreement.
According to Napoleon, what the animals must do was to procure firearms and train themselves in the use of them.
According to Snowball, they must send out more and more pigeons and stir up rebellion among the animals on the other farms.
The one argued that if they could not defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the other argued that if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defend themselves.
The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, and could not make up their minds which was right.
Indeed, they always found themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment.
At last the day came when Snowball’s plans were completed.
At the Meeting on the following Sunday the question of whether or not to begin work on the windmill was to be put to the vote.
When the animals had assembled in the big barn, Snowball stood up and, though occasionally interrupted by bleating from the sheep, set forth his reasons for advocating the building of the windmill.
Then Napoleon stood up to reply.
He said very quietly that the windmill was nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote for it, and promptly sat down again.
He had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and seemed almost indifferent as to the effect he produced.
At this Snowball sprang to his feet, and shouting down the sheep, who had begun bleating again, broke into a passionate appeal in favour of the windmill.
Until now the animals had been about equally divided in their sympathies, but in a moment Snowball’s eloquence had carried them away.
His imagination had now run far beyond chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers.
By the time he had finished speaking, there was no doubt as to which way the vote would go.
But just at this moment Napoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at Snowball, uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before.
At this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous dogs wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn.
They dashed straight for Snowball, who only sprang from his place just in time to escape their snapping jaws.
Too amazed and frightened to speak, all the animals crowded through the door to watch the chase.
Snowball was racing across the long pasture that led to the road. He was running as only a pig can run, but the dogs were close on his heels.
Suddenly he slipped and it seemed certain that they had him.
Then he was up again, running faster than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again.
One of them all but closed his jaws on Snowball’s tail, but Snowball whisked it free just in time.
Then he put on an extra spurt and, with a few inches to spare, slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen no more.
Silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn.
In a moment the dogs came bounding back.
At first no one had been able to imagine where these creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved: they were the puppies whom Napoleon had taken away from their mothers and reared privately.
Though not yet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and as fierce-looking as wolves.
They kept close to Napoleon.
It was noticed that they wagged their tails to him in the same way as the other dogs had been used to do to Mr. Jones.
Napoleon, with the dogs following him, now mounted on to the raised portion of the floor where Major had previously stood to deliver his speech.
He announced that from now on the Sunday-morning Meetings would come to an end.
They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time.
In future all questions relating to the working of the farm would be settled by a special committee of pigs, presided over by himself.
These would meet in private and afterwards communicate their decisions to the others.
The animals would still assemble on Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing Beasts of England, and receive their orders for the week.
There would be no more debates.
In spite of the shock that Snowball’s expulsion had given them, the animals were dismayed by this announcement.
Several of them would have protested if they could have found the right arguments.
Even Boxer was vaguely troubled.
He set his ears back, shook his forelock several times, and tried hard to marshal his thoughts; but in the end he could not think of anything to say.
Some of the pigs themselves, however, were more articulate.
Four young porkers in the front row uttered shrill squeals of disapproval, and all four of them sprang to their feet and began speaking at once.
But suddenly the dogs sitting round Napoleon let out deep, menacing growls.
The pigs fell silent and sat down again.
Then the sheep broke out into a tremendous bleating of four legs good, two legs bad! which went on for nearly a quarter of an hour and put an end to any chance of discussion.
Afterwards Squealer was sent round the farm to explain the new arrangement to the others.
Comrades, he said, I trust that every animal here appreciates the sacrifice that Comrade Napoleon has made in taking this extra labour upon himself.
Suppose you had decided to follow Snowball, with his moonshine of windmills Snowball, who, as we now know, was no better than a criminal?
He fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed, said somebody.
Bravery is not enough, said Squealer.
Loyalty and obedience are more important.
And as to the Battle of the Cowshed, I believe the time will come when we shall find that Snowball’s part in it was much exaggerated.
Discipline, comrades, iron discipline!
One false step, and our enemies would be upon us.
Surely, comrades, you do not want Jones back?
Once again this argument was unanswerable.
Certainly the animals did not want Jones back.
if the holding of debates on Sunday mornings was liable to bring him back, then the debates must stop.
Boxer, who had now had time to think things over, voiced the general feeling.
He said: If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right.
And from then on he adopted the maxim, Napoleon is always right, in addition to his private motto of will work harder.
By this time the weather had broken and the spring ploughing had begun.
The shed where Snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill had been shut up and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off the floor.
Every Sunday morning at ten o’clock the animals assembled in the big barn to receive their orders for the week.
The skull of old Major, now clean of flesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at the foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun.
After the hoisting of the flag, the animals were required to file past the skull in a reverent manner before entering the barn.
Nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done in the past.
Napoleon, with Squealer and another pig named Minimus, who had a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems, sat on the front of the raised platform, with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle round them, and the other pigs sitting behind.
The rest of the animals sat facing them in the main body of the barn.
Napoleon read out the orders for the week in a gruff soldierly style, and after a single singing of Beasts of England, all the animals dispersed.
On the third Sunday after Snowball’s expulsion, the animals were somewhat surprised to hear Napoleon announce that the windmill was to be built after all.
He did not give any reason for having changed his mind, but merely warned the animals that this extra task would mean very hard work, it might even be necessary to reduce their rations.
The plans, however, had all been prepared, down to the last detail.
A special committee of pigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks.
The building of the windmill, with various other improvements, was expected to take two years.
That Sunday evening Squealer explained privately to the other animals that Napoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill.
Now that Snowball was out of the way, the plan could go forward without his interference.
The animals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke so persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions.
All that year the animals worked like slaves, but they were happy in their work.
They grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.
Throughout the one year they worked a sixty-hour week, and in August Napoleon announced that there would be work on Sunday afternoons as well.
This work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half.
Even so, it was found necessary to leave certain tasks undone.
The harvest was a little less successful than in the previous year, and two fields which should have been sown with roots in the early summer were not sown because the ploughing had not been completed early enough.
It was possible to foresee that the coming winter would be a hard one.
The windmill presented unexpected difficulties.
There was a good quarry of limestone on the farm, and plenty of sand and cement had been found in one of the outhouses, so that all the materials for building were at hand.
Only after weeks of vain effort did the right idea occur to somebody namely, to utilise the force of gravity.
Huge boulders, far too big to be used as they were, were lying all over the bed of the quarry.
The animals lashed ropes round these, and then all together, cows, horses, sheep, any animal that could lay hold of the rope even the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments they dragged them with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry, where they were toppled over the edge, to shatter to pieces below.
Transporting the stone when it was once broken was comparatively simple.
The horses carried it off in cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even Muriel and Benjamin yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their share.
By late summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and then the building began, under the superintendence of the pigs.
But it was a slow, laborious process.
Frequently it took a whole day of exhausting effort to drag a single boulder to the top of the quarry, and sometimes when it was pushed over the edge it failed to break.
Nothing could have been achieved without Boxer, whose strength seemed equal to that of all the rest of the animals put together.
When the boulder began to slip and the animals cried out in despair at finding themselves dragged down the hill, it was always Boxer who strained himself against the rope and brought the boulder to a stop.
To see him toiling up the slope inch by inch, his breath coming fast, the tips of his hoofs clawing at the ground, and his great sides matted with sweat, filled everyone with admiration.
Clover warned him sometimes to be careful not to overstrain himself, but Boxer would never listen to her.
His two slogans, I will work harder and Napoleon is always right, seemed to him a sufficient answer to all problems.
He had made arrangements with the cockerel to call him three-quarters of an hour earlier in the mornings instead of half an hour.
And in his spare moments, of which there were not many nowadays, he would go alone to the quarry, collect a load of broken stone, and drag it down to the site of the windmill unassisted.
The animals were not badly off throughout that summer, in spite of the hardness of their work.
If they had no more food than they had had in Jones’s day, at least they did not have less.
The advantage of only having to feed themselves, and not having to support five extravagant human beings as well, was so great that it would have taken a lot of failures to outweigh it.
And in many ways the animal method of doing things was more efficient and saved labour.
Such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be done with a thoroughness impossible to human beings.
And again, since no animal now stole, it was unnecessary to fence off pasture from arable land, which saved a lot of labour on the upkeep of hedges and gates.
Nevertheless, as the summer wore on, various unforeseen shortages began to make them selves felt.
There was need of paraffin oil, nails, string, dog biscuits, and iron for the horses shoes, none of which could be produced on the farm.
Later there would also be need for seeds and artificial manures, besides various tools and, finally, the machinery for the windmill.
How these were to be procured, no one was able to imagine.
One Sunday morning, when the animals assembled to receive their orders, Napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy.
From now on-wards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose, but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary.
The needs of the windmill must override everything else, he said.
He was therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of hay and part of the current year’s wheat crop, and later on, if more money were needed, it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs, for which there was always a market in Willingdon.
The hens, said Napoleon, should welcome this sacrifice as their own special contribution towards the building of the windmill.
Once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness.
Never to have any dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never to make use of money had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed at that first triumphant Meeting after Jones was expelled?
All the animals remembered passing such resolutions: or at least they thought that they remembered it.
The four young pigs who had protested when Napoleon abolished the Meetings raised their voices timidly, but they were promptly silenced by a tremendous growling from the dogs.
Then, as usual, the sheep broke into four legs good, two legs bad! and the momentary awkwardness was smoothed over.
Finally Napoleon raised his trotter for silence and announced that he had already made all the arrangements.
There would be no need for any of the animals to come in contact with human beings, which would clearly be most undesirable.
He intended to take the whole burden upon his own shoulders.
A Mr. Whymper, a solicitor living in Willingdon, had agreed to act as intermediary between Animal Farm and the outside world, and would visit the farm every Monday morning to receive his instructions.
Napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of Long live Animal Farm! and after the singing of Beasts of England the animals were dismissed.
Afterwards Squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals minds at rest.
He assured them that the resolution against engaging in trade and using money had never been passed, or even suggested.
It was pure imagination, probably traceable in the beginning to lies circulated by Snowball.
A few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but Squealer asked them shrewdly, are you certain that this is not something that you have dreamed, comrades?
Is it written down anywhere?
Every Monday Mr. Whymper visited the farm as had been arranged.
He was a sly-looking little man with side whiskers, a solicitor in a very small way of business, but sharp enough to have realised earlier than anyone else that Animal Farm would need a broker and that the commissions would be worth having.
The animals watched his coming and going with a kind of dread, and avoided him as much as possible. Nevertheless, the sight of Napoleon, on all fours, delivering orders to Whymper, who stood on two legs, roused their pride and partly reconciled them to the new arrangement.
Their relations with the human race were now not quite the same as they had been before.
The human beings did not hate Animal Farm any less now that it was prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever.
Every human being held it as an article of faith that the farm would go bankrupt sooner or later, and, above all, that the windmill would be a failure.
They would meet in the public-houses and prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work.
And yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs.
One symptom of this was that they had begun to call Animal Farm by its proper name and ceased to pretend that it was called the Manor Farm.
They had also dropped their championship of Jones, who had given up hope of getting his farm back and gone to live in another part of the county.
Except through Whymper, there was as yet no contact between Animal Farm and the outside world, but there were constant rumours that Napoleon was about to enter into a definite business agreement either with Mr. Pilkington of Foxwood or with Mr. Frederick of Pinchfield but never, it was noticed, with both simultaneously.
It was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and took up their residence there.
Again the animals seemed to remember that a resolution against this had been passed in the early days, and again Squealer was able to convince them that this was not the case.
It was absolutely necessary, he said, that the pigs, who were the brains of the farm, should have a quiet place to work in.
It was also more suited to the dignity of the Leader (for of late he had taken to speaking of Napoleon under the title of Leader) to live in a house than in a mere sty.
Nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed when they heard that the pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen and used the drawing-room as a recreation room, but also slept in the beds.
Boxer passed it off as usual with Napoleon is always right!, but Clover, who thought she remembered a definite ruling against beds, went to the end of the barn and tried to puzzle out the Seven Commandments which were inscribed there.
Finding herself unable to read more than individual letters, she fetched Muriel.
Muriel, she said, read me the Fourth Commandment.
Does it not say something about never sleeping in a bed?
With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out.
It says, No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets, she announced finally.
Curiously enough, Clover had not remembered that the Fourth Commandment mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so.
And Squealer, who happened to be passing at this moment, attended by two or three dogs, was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective.
You have heard then, comrades, he said, that we pigs now sleep in the beds of the farmhouse?
And why not?
A bed merely means a place to sleep in.
A pile of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded.
The rule was against sheets, which are a human invention.
We have removed the sheets from the farmhouse beds, and sleep between blankets.
And very comfortable beds they are too!
But not more comfortable than we need, I can tell you, comrades, with all the brainwork we have to do nowadays.
When winter was coming close the animals were tired but happy.
They had had a hard year, and after the sale of part of the hay and corn, the stores of food for the winter were none too plentiful, but the windmill compensated for everything.
It was almost half built now.
After the harvest there was a stretch of clear dry weather, and the animals toiled harder than ever, thinking it well worth while to plod to and fro all day with blocks of stone if by doing so they could raise the walls another foot.
Boxer would even come out at nights and work for an hour or two on his own by the light of the harvest moon.
In their spare moments the animals would walk round and round the half-finished mill, admiring the strength and perpendicularity of its walls and marvelling that they should ever have been able to build anything so imposing.
Only old Benjamin refused to grow enthusiastic about the windmill, though, as usual, he would utter nothing beyond the cryptic remark that donkeys live a long time.
November came, with raging south-west winds.
Building had to stop because it was now too wet to mix the cement.
Finally there came a night when the gale was so violent that the farm buildings rocked on their foundations and several tiles were blown off the roof of the barn.
The hens woke up squawking with terror because they had all dreamed simultaneously of hearing a gun go off in the distance.
In the morning the animals came out of their stalls to find that the flagstaff had been blown down and an elm tree at the foot of the orchard had been plucked up like a radish.
They had just noticed this when a cry of despair broke from every animal’s throat.
A terrible sight had met their eyes.
The windmill was in ruins.
With one accord they dashed down to the spot.
Napoleon, who seldom moved out of a walk, raced ahead of them all.
Yes, there it lay, the fruit of all their struggles, levelled to its foundations, the stones they had broken and carried so laboriously scattered all around. Unable at first to speak, they stood gazing mournfully at the litter of fallen stone Napoleon paced to and fro in silence, occasionally snuffing at the ground.
His tail had grown rigid and twitched sharply from side to side, a sign in him of intense mental activity.
Suddenly he halted as though his mind were made up.
Comrades, he said quietly, do you know who is responsible for this?
Do you know the enemy who has come in the night and overthrown our windmill?
SNOWBALL! he suddenly roared in a voice of thunder.
Snowball has done this thing!
In sheer malignity, thinking to set back our plans and avenge himself for his ignominious expulsion, this traitor has crept here under cover of night and destroyed our work of nearly a year.
Comrades, here and now I pronounce the death sentence upon Snowball.
Animal Hero, Second Class, and half a bushelof apples to any animal who brings him to justice.
A full bushel to anyone who captures him alive!
The animals were shocked beyond measure to learn that even Snowball could be guilty of such an action.
There was a cry of indignation, and everyone began thinking out ways of catching Snowball if he should ever come back.
Almost immediately the footprints of a pig were discovered in the grass at a little distance from the knoll.
They could only be traced for a few yards, but appeared to lead to a hole in the hedge.
Napoleon snuffed deeply at them and pronounced them to be Snowball’s.
He gave it as his opinion that Snowball had probably come from the direction of Foxwood Farm.
No more delays, comrades! cried Napoleon when the footprints had been examined.
There is work to be done.
This very morning we begin rebuilding the windmill, and we will build all through the winter, rain or shine.
We will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily.
Remember, comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans: they shall be carried out to the day.
Forward, comrades!
Long live the windmill!
Long live Animal Farm!
It was a bitter winter.
Out of spite, the human beings pretended not to believe that it was Snowball who had destroyed the windmill: they said that it had fallen down because the walls were too thin.
The animals knew that this was not the case.
Still, it had been decided to build the walls three feet thick this time instead of eighteen inches as before, which meant collecting much larger quantities of stone.
Some progress was made in the dry frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before.
They were always cold, and usually hungry as well.
Only Boxer and Clover never lost heart.
Squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in Boxer’s strength and his never-failing cry of I will work harder!.
In January food fell short.
The corn ration was drastically reduced, and it was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up for it.
Then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato crop had been frosted in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly enough.
For days at a time the animals had nothing to eat but chaff and mangels.
Starvation seemed to stare them in the face.
It was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside world.
Emboldened by the collapse of the windmill, the human beings were inventing fresh lies about Animal Farm.
Once again it was being put about that all the animals were dying of famine and disease, and that they were continually fighting among themselves and had resorted to cannibalism and infanticide.
Napoleon was well aware of the bad results that might follow if the real facts of the food situation were known, and he decided to make use of Mr Whymper to spread a contrary impression.
Hitherto the animals had had little or no contact with Whymper on his weekly visits: now, however, a few selected animals, mostly sheep, were instructed to remark casually in his hearing that rations had been increased.
In addition, Napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal.
On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through the store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins.
He was deceived, and continued to report to the outside world that there was no food shortage on Animal Farm.
Nevertheless, towards the end of January it became obvious that it would be necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere.
In these days Napoleon rarely appeared in public, but spent all his time in the farmhouse, which was guarded at each door by fierce-looking dogs.
When he did emerge, it was in a ceremonial manner, with an escort of six dogs who closely surrounded him and growled if anyone came too near.
Frequently he did not even appear on Sunday mornings, but issued his orders through one of the other pigs, usually Squealer.
One Sunday morning Squealer announced that the hens, who had just come in to lay again, must surrender their eggs.
Napoleon had accepted, through Whymper, a contract for four hundred eggs a week.
The price of these would pay for enough grain and meal to keep the farm going till summer came on and conditions were easier.
When the hens heard this, they raised a terrible outcry.
They had been warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary, but had not believed that it would really happen.
They were just getting their clutches ready for the spring sitting, and they protested that to take the eggs away now was murder.
For the first time since the expulsion of Jones, there was something resembling a rebellion.
Led by three young Black Minorca pullets, the hens made a determined effort to thwart Napoleon’s wishes.
Their method was to fly up to the rafters and there lay their eggs, which smashed to pieces on the floor.
Napoleon acted swiftly and ruthlessly.
He ordered the hens’ rations to be stopped, and decreed that any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen should be punished by death.
The dogs saw to it that these orders were carried out.
For five days the hens held out, then they capitulated and went back to their nesting boxes.
Nine hens had died in the meantime.
Their bodies were buried in the orchard, and it was given out that they had died of coccidiosis.
Whymper heard nothing of this affair, and the eggs were duly delivered, a grocer’s van driving up to the farm once a week to take them away.
All this while no more had been seen of Snowball.
He was rumoured to be hiding on one of the neighbouring farms, either Foxwood or Pinchfield.
Napoleon was by this time on slightly better terms with the other farmers than before.
It happened that there was in the yard a pile of timber which had been stacked there ten years earlier when a beech spinney was cleared.
Whymper had advised Napoleon to sell it.
Mr. Pilkington and Mr. Frederick were anxious to buy it.
Napoleon was hesitating between the two, unable to make up his mind.
It was noticed that whenever he seemed on the point of coming to an agreement with Frederick, Snowball was declared to be in hiding at Foxwood, while, when he inclined toward Pilkington, Snowball was said to be at Pinchfield.
Suddenly, at the end of winter, an alarming thing was discovered.
Snowball was secretly frequenting the farm by night!
The animals were so disturbed that they could hardly sleep in their stalls.
Every night, it was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief.
He stole the corn, he upset the milk-pails, he broke the eggs, he trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees.
Whenever anything went wrong it became usual to attribute it to Snowball.
If a window was broken or a drain was blocked up, someone was certain to say that Snowball had come in the night and done it, and when the key of the store-shed was lost, the whole farm was convinced that Snowball had thrown it down the well.
Curiously enough, they went on believing this even after the mislaid key was found under a sack of meal.
The cows declared unanimously that Snowball crept into their stalls and milked them in their sleep.
The rats, which had been troublesome that winter, were also said to be in league with Snowball.
Napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into Snowball’s activities.
With his dogs in attendance he set out and made a careful tour of inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals following at a respectful distance.
At every few steps Napoleon stopped and snuffed the ground for traces of Snowball’s footsteps, which, he said, he could detect by the smell.
He snuffed in every corner, in the barn, in the cow-shed, in the henhouses, in the vegetable garden, and found traces of Snowball almost everywhere.
He would put his snout to the ground, give several deep sniffs, ad exclaim in a terrible voice, Snowball!
He has been here!
I can smell him distinctly! and at the word Snowball all the dogs let out blood-curdling growls and showed their side teeth.
The animals were thoroughly frightened.
It seemed to them as though Snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers.
In the evening Squealer called them together, and with an alarmed expression on his face told them that he had some serious news to report.
Comrades! cried Squealer, making little nervous skips, a most terrible thing has been discovered.
Snowball has sold himself to Frederick of Pinchfield Farm, who is even now plotting to attack us and take our farm away from us!
Snowball is to act as his guide when the attack begins.
But there is worse than that.
We had thought that Snowball’s rebellion was caused simply by his vanity and ambition.
But we were wrong, comrades.
Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start!
It has all been proved by documents which he left behind him and which we have only just discovered.
To my mind this explains a great deal, comrades.
Did we not see for ourselves how he attempted fortunately without success to get us defeated and destroyed at the Battle of the Cowshed?
The animals were stupefied.
This was a wickedness far outdoing Snowball’s destruction of the windmill.
But it was some minutes before they could fully take it in.
They all remembered, or thought they remembered, how they had seen Snowball charging ahead of them at the Battle of the Cowshed, how he had rallied and encouraged them at every turn, and how he had not paused for an instant even when the pellets from Jones’s gun had wounded his back.
At first it was a little difficult to see how this fitted in with his being on Jones’s side.
Even Boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled.
He lay down, tucked his fore hoofs beneath him, shut his eyes, and with a hard effort managed to formulate his thoughts.
I do not believe that, he said.
Snowball fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed.
Did we not give him Animal Hero, First Class, immediately afterwards?
That was our mistake, comrade.
For we know now it is all written down in the secret documents that we have found  that in reality he was trying to lure us to our doom.
But he was wounded, said Boxer. We all saw him running with blood.
That was part of the arrangement! cried Squealer. Jones’s shot only grazed him.
I could show you this in his own writing, if you were able to read it.
The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to give the signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy.
And he very nearly succeeded I will even say, comrades, he would have succeeded if it had not been for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon.
Comrade Napoleon sprang forward with a cry of Death to Humanity! and sank his teeth in Joness leg?
Our Leader, Comrade Napoleon, announced Squealer, speaking very slowly and firmly, has stated categorically  categorically, comrade  that Snowball was Jones’s agent from the very beginning  yes, and from long before the Rebellion was ever thought of.
Ah, that is different!
If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right.
That is the true spirit, comrade! cried Squealer, but it was noticed he cast a very ugly look at Boxer with his little twinkling eyes.
He turned to go, then paused and added impressively: I warn every animal on this farm to keep his eyes very wide open.
For we have reason to think that some of Snowballs secret agents are lurking among us at this moment!
Four days later, in the late afternoon, Napoleon ordered all the animals to assemble in the yard.
When they were all gathered together, Napoleon emerged from the farmhouse, wearing both his medals (for he had recently awarded himself Animal Hero, First Class, and Animal Hero, Second Class), with his nine huge dogs frisking round him and uttering growls that sent shivers down all the animals spines.
They all cowered silently in their places, seeming to know in advance that some terrible thing was about to happen.
Napoleon stood sternly surveying his audience; then he uttered a high-pitched whimper.
Immediately the dogs bounded forward, seized four of the pigs by the ear and dragged them, squealing with pain and terror, to Napoleons feet.
The pigs ears were bleeding, the dogs had tasted blood, and for a few moments they appeared to go quite mad.
Boxer saw them coming and put out his great hoof, caught a dog in mid-air, and pinned him to the ground.
The dog shrieked for mercy and the other two fled with their tails between their legs.
Boxer looked at Napoleon to know whether he should crush the dog to death or let it go.
Napoleon appeared to change countenance, and sharply ordered Boxer to let the dog go.
Boxer lifted his hoof, and the dog slunk away, bruised and howling.
Presently the tumult died down.
The four pigs waited, trembling, with guilt written on every line of their countenances.
Napoleon now called upon them to confess their crimes.
They were the same four pigs as had protested when Napoleon abolished the Sunday Meetings.
Without any further prompting they confessed that they had been secretly in touch with Snowball ever since his expulsion, that they had collaborated with him in destroying the windmill, and that they had entered into an agreement with him to hand over Animal Farm to Mr Frederick.
They added that Snowball had privately admitted to them that he had been Joness secret agent for years past.
When they had finished their confession, the dogs promptly tore their throats out, and in a terrible voice Napoleon demanded whether any other animal had anything to confess.
The three hens who had been the ringleaders in the attempted rebellion over the eggs now came forward and stated that Snowball had appeared to them in a dream and incited them to disobey Napoleons orders.
They, too, were slaughtered.
Then a goose came forward and confessed to having secreted six ears of corn during the last years harvest and eaten them in the night.
Then a sheep confessed to having urinated in the drinking pool  urged to do this, so she said, by Snowball and two other sheep confessed to having murdered an old ram, an especially devoted follower of Napoleon, by chasing him round and round a bonfire when he was suffering from a cough.
And so the tale of confessions and executions went on, until there was a pile of corpses lying before Napoleons feet and the air was heavy with the smell of blood, which had been unknown there since the expulsion of Jones.
When it was all over, the remaining animals, except for the pigs and dogs, crept away in a body.
They were shaken and miserable.
They did not know which was more shocking the treachery of the animals who had leagued themselves with Snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just witnessed.
In the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed equally terrible, but it seemed to all of them that it was far worse now that it was happening among themselves.
Since Jones had left the farm, until today, no animal had killed another animal.
Not even a rat had been killed.
They had made their way on to the little knoll where the half-finished windmill stood, and with one accord they all lay down as though huddling together for warmth  Clover, Muriel, Benjamin, the cows, the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens  everyone, indeed, except the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before Napoleon ordered the animals to assemble.
For some time nobody spoke.
Only Boxer remained on his feet.
He fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long black tail against his sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise.
Finally he said: I do not understand it.
I would not have believed that such things could happen on our farm.
It must be due to some fault in ourselves.
The solution, as I see it, is to work harder.
From now onwards I shall get up a full hour earlier in the mornings.
And he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry.
Having got there, he collected two successive loads of stone and dragged them down to the windmill before retiring for the night.
The animals huddled about Clover, not speaking.
The knoll where they were lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside.
Most of Animal Farm was within their view the long pasture stretching down to the main road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys.
It was a clear spring evening.
The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun.
Never had the farm and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own property appeared to the animals so desirable a place.
As Clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears.
If she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race.
These scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when old Major first stirred them to rebellion.
If she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of Majors speech.
Instead she did not know why they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes.
There was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind.
She knew that, even as things were, they were far better off than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings.
Whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon.
But still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled.
It was not for this that they had built the windmill and faced the bullets of Joness gun.
Such were her thoughts, though she lacked the words to express them.
At last, feeling this to be in some way a substitute for the words she was unable to find, she began to sing Beasts of England.
The other animals sitting round her took it up, and they sang it three times over  very tunefully, but slowly and mournfully, in a way they had never sung it before.
They had just finished singing it for the third time when Squealer, attended by two dogs, approached them with the air of having something important to say.
He announced that, by a special decree of Comrade Napoleon, Beasts of England had been abolished.
From now onwards it was forbidden to sing it.
The animals were taken aback.
Why? cried Muriel.
Its no longer needed, comrade, said Squealer stiffly.
Beasts of England was the song of the Rebellion.
But the Rebellion is now completed.
The execution of the traitors this afternoon was the final act.
The enemy both external and internal has been defeated.
Clearly this song has no longer any purpose.
Frightened though they were, some of the animals might possibly have protested, but at this moment the sheep set up their usual bleating of Four legs good, two legs bad, which went on for several minutes and put an end to the discussion.
So Beasts of England was heard no more. In its place Minimus, the poet, had composed another song which began: Animal Farm, Animal Farm, Never through me shall come to harm!
This was sung every Sunday morning after the hoisting of the flag.
But somehow neither the words nor the tune ever seemed to the animals to come up to Beasts of England.
A few days later, when the terror caused by the executions had died down, some of the animals remembered  or thought they remembered  that the Sixth Commandment decreed No animal shall kill any other animal.
And though no one cared to mention it in the hearing of the pigs or the dogs, it was felt that the killings which had taken place did not square with this.
Clover asked Benjamin to read her the Sixth Commandment, and when Benjamin, as usual, said that he refused to meddle in such matters, she fetched Muriel.
Muriel read the Commandment for her.
It ran: No animal shall kill any other animal without cause.
Somehow or other, the last two words had slipped out of the animals memory.
But they saw now that the Commandment had not been violated.
Clearly there was good reason for killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with Snowball.
Throughout the year the animals worked even harder than they had worked in the previous year.
To rebuild the windmill, with walls twice as thick as before, and to finish it by the appointed date, together with the regular work of the farm, was a tremendous labour.
There were times when it seemed to the animals that they worked longer hours and fed no better than they had done in Jones’s day.
On Sunday mornings Squealer, holding down a long strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to them lists of figures proving that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by two hundred per cent, three hundred per cent, or five hundred per cent, as the case might be.
The animals saw no reason to disbelieve him, especially as they could no longer remember very clearly what conditions had been like before the Rebellion.
All the same, there were days when they felt that they would sooner have had less figures and more food.
All orders were now issued through Squealer or one of the other pigs.
Napoleon himself was not seen in public as often as once in a fortnight.
When he did appear, he was attended not only by his retinue of dogs but by a black cockerel who marched in front of him and acted as a kind of trumpeter, letting out a loud cock-a-doodle-doo before Napoleon spoke.
Even in the farmhouse, it was said, Napoleon inhabited separate apartments from the others.
He took his meals alone, with two dogs to wait upon him, and always ate from the Crown Derby dinner service which had been in the glass cupboard in the drawing-room.
It was also announced that the gun would be fired every year on Napoleons birthday, as well as on the other two anniversaries.
Napoleon was now never spoken of simply as Napoleon.
He was always referred to in formal style as our Leader, Comrade Napoleon, and this pigs liked to invent for him such titles as Father of All Animals, Terror of Mankind, Protector of the Sheep-fold, Ducklings Friend, and the like.
In his speeches, Squealer would talk with the tears rolling down his cheeks of Napoleons wisdom the goodness of his heart, and the deep love he bore to all animals everywhere, even and especially the unhappy animals who still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms.
It had become usual to give Napoleon the credit for every successful achievement and every stroke of good fortune.
You would often hear one hen remark to another, Under the guidance of our Leader, Comrade Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days; or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would exclaim, Thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, how excellent this water tastes!
The general feeling on the farm was well expressed in a poem entitled Comrade Napoleon, which was composed by Minimus and which ran as follows:
Friend of fatherless!
Fountain of happiness!
Napoleon approved of this poem and caused it to be inscribed on the wall of the big barn, at the opposite end from the Seven Commandments.
The pile of timber was still unsold.
At the same time there were renewed rumours that Frederick and his men were plotting to attack Animal Farm and to destroy the windmill, the building of which had aroused furious jealousy in him.
Snowball was known to be still skulking on Pinchfield Farm.
In the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to hear that three hens had come forward and confessed that, inspired by Snowball, they had entered into a plot to murder Napoleon.
They were executed immediately, and fresh precautions for Napoleons safety were taken.
Four dogs guarded his bed at night, one at each corner, and a young pig named Pinkeye was given the task of tasting all his food before he ate it, lest it should be poisoned.
At about the same time it was given out that Napoleon had arranged to sell the pile of timber to Mr. Pilkington; he was also going to enter into a regular agreement for the exchange of certain products between Animal Farm and Foxwood.
The relations between Napoleon and Pilkington, though they were only conducted through Whymper, were now almost friendly.
The animals distrusted Pilkington, as a human being, but greatly preferred him to Frederick, whom they both feared and hated.
As the summer wore on, and the windmill neared completion, the rumours of an impending treacherous attack grew stronger and stronger.
Frederick, it was said, intended to bring against them twenty men all armed with guns, and he had already bribed the magistrates and police, so that if he could once get hold of the title-deeds of Animal Farm they would ask no questions.
Moreover, terrible stories were leaking out from Pinchfield about the cruelties that Frederick practised upon his animals.
He had flogged an old horse to death, he starved his cows, he had killed a dog by throwing it into the furnace, he amused himself in the evenings by making cocks fight with splinters of razor-blade tied to their spurs.
The animals blood boiled with rage when they heard of these things being done to their comrades, and sometimes they clamoured to be allowed to go out in a body and attack Pinchfield Farm, drive out the humans, and set the animals free.
One Sunday morning Napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he had never at any time contemplated selling the pile of timber to Frederick; he considered it beneath his dignity, he said, to have dealings with scoundrels of that description.
The pigeons who were still sent out to spread tidings of the Rebellion were forbidden to set foot anywhere on Foxwood, and were also ordered to drop their former slogan of Death to Humanity in favour of Death to Frederick.
In the late summer yet another of Snowballs machinations was laid bare.
The wheat crop was full of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits Snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn.
A gander who had been privy to the plot had confessed his guilt to Squealer and immediately committed suicide by swallowing deadly nightshade berries.
The animals now also learned that Snowball had never  as many of them had believed hitherto  received the order of Animal Hero, First Class.
Once again some of the animals heard this with a certain bewilderment, but Squealer was soon able to convince them that their memories had been at fault.
The machinery had still to be installed, and Whymper was negotiating the purchase of it, but the structure was completed.
In the teeth of every difficulty, in spite of inexperience, of primitive implements, of bad luck and of Snowballs treachery, the work had been finished punctually to the very day!
Tired out but proud, the animals walked round and round their masterpiece, which appeared even more beautiful in their eyes than when it had been built the first time.
Moreover, the walls were twice as thick as before.
And when they thought of how they had laboured, what discouragements they had overcome, and the enormous difference that would be made in their lives when the sails were turning and the dynamos running  when they thought of all this, their tiredness forsook them and they gambolled round and round the windmill, uttering cries of triumph.
Napoleon himself, attended by his dogs and his cockerel, came down to inspect the completed work.
He personally congratulated the animals on their achievement, and announced that the mill would be named Napoleon Mill.
Two days later the animals were called together for a special meeting in the barn.
They were struck dumb with surprise when Napoleon announced that he had sold the pile of timber to Frederick.
Tomorrow Fredericks wagons would arrive and begin carting it away.
Throughout the whole period of his seeming friendship with Pilkington, Napoleon had really been in secret agreement with Frederick.
All relations with Foxwood had been broken off; insulting messages had been sent to Pilkington.
The pigeons had been told to avoid Pinchfield Farm and to alter their slogan from Death to Frederick to Death to Pilkington.
At the same time Napoleon assured the animals that the stories of an impending attack on Animal Farm were completely untrue, and that the tales about Fredericks cruelty to his own animals had been greatly exaggerated.
All these rumours had probably originated with Snowball and his agents.
It now appeared that Snowball was not, after all, hiding on Pinchfield Farm, and in fact had never been there in his life: he was living  in considerable luxury, so it was said  at Foxwood, and had in reality been a pensioner of Pilkington for years past.
The pigs were in ecstasies over Napoleons cunning.
By seeming to be friendly with Pilkington he had forced Frederick to raise his price by twelve pounds.
But the superior quality of Napoleons mind, said Squealer, was shown in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even Frederick.
Frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something called a cheque.
But Napoleon was too clever for him.
He had demanded payment in real five-pound notes, which were to be handed over before the timber was removed.
Boxer put out his nose to sniff at the bank-notes, and the flimsy white things stirred and rustled in his breath.
Three days later there was a terrible hullabaloo.
Whymper, his face deadly pale, came racing up the path on his bicycle, flung it down in the yard and rushed straight into the farmhouse.
The next moment a choking roar of rage sounded from Napoleons apartments.
The news of what had happened sped round the farm like wildfire.
The banknotes were forgeries! Frederick had got the timber for nothing!
Napoleon called the animals together immediately and in a terrible voice pronounced the death sentence upon Frederick.
When captured, he said, Frederick should be boiled alive.
At the same time he warned them that after this treacherous deed the worst was to be expected.
Sentinels were placed at all the approaches to the farm.
In addition, four pigeons were sent to Foxwood with a conciliatory message, which it was hoped might re-establish good relations with Pilkington.
The very next morning the attack came.
The animals were at breakfast when the look-outs came racing in with the news that Frederick and his followers had already come through the five-barred gate.
Boldly enough the animals sallied forth to meet them, but this time they did not have the easy victory that they had had in the Battle of the Cowshed.
There were fifteen men, with half a dozen guns between them, and they opened fire as soon as they got within fifty yards.
The animals could not face the terrible explosions and the stinging pellets, and in spite of the efforts of Napoleon and Boxer to rally them, they were soon driven back.
A number of them were already wounded.
They took refuge in the farm buildings and peeped cautiously out from chinks and knot-holes.
The whole of the big pasture, including the windmill, was in the hands of the enemy.
For the moment even Napoleon seemed at a loss.
He paced up and down without a word, his tail rigid and twitching.
Wistful glances were sent in the direction of Fox wood.
If Pilkington and his men would help them, the day might yet be won.
But at this moment the four pigeons, who had been sent out on the day before, returned, one of them bearing a scrap of paper from Pilkington.
The animals watched them, and a murmur of dismay went round.
Two of the men had produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer.
They were going to knock the windmill down.
Impossible! cried Napoleon.
We have built the walls far too thick for that.
They could not knock it down in a week.
Courage, comrades!
But Benjamin was watching the movements of the men intently.
The two with the hammer and the crowbar were drilling a hole near the base of the windmill.
Slowly, and with an air almost of amusement, Benjamin nodded his long muzzle.
I thought so, he said.
Do you not see what they are doing?
In another moment they are going to pack blasting powder into that hole.
Terrified, the animals waited.
It was impossible now to venture out of the shelter of the buildings.
After a few minutes the men were seen to be running in all directions.
Then there was a deafening roar.
The pigeons swirled into the air, and all the animals, except Napoleon, flung themselves flat on their bellies and hid their faces.
When they got up again, a huge cloud of black smoke was hanging where the windmill had been.
Slowly the breeze drifted it away.
The windmill had ceased to exist!
At this sight the animals courage returned to them.
The fear and despair they had felt a moment earlier were drowned in their rage against this vile, contemptible act.
A mighty cry for vengeance went up, and without waiting for further orders they charged forth in a body and made straight for the enemy.
This time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept over them like hail.
It was a savage, bitter battle.
The men fired again and again, and, when the animals got to close quarters, lashed out with their sticks and their heavy boots.
A cow, three sheep, and two geese were killed, and nearly everyone was wounded.
Even Napoleon, who was directing operations from the rear, had the tip of his tail chipped by a pellet.
But the men did not go unscathed either.
Three of them had their heads broken by blows from Boxers hoofs; another was gored in the belly by a cows horn; another had his trousers nearly torn off by Jessie and Bluebell.
And when the nine dogs of Napoleons own bodyguard, whom he had instructed to make a detour under cover of the hedge, suddenly appeared on the mens flank, baying ferociously, panic overtook them.
They saw that they were in danger of being surrounded.
Frederick shouted to his men to get out while the going was good, and the next moment the cowardly enemy was running for dear life.
The animals chased them right down to the bottom of the field, and got in some last kicks at them as they forced their way through the thorn hedge.
They had won, but they were weary and bleeding.
Slowly they began to limp back towards the farm.
The sight of their dead comrades stretched upon the grass moved some of them to tears.
And for a little while they halted in sorrowful silence at the place where the windmill had once stood.
Yes, it was gone; almost the last trace of their labour was gone!
Even the foundations were partially destroyed.
And in rebuilding it they could not this time, as before, make use of the fallen stones.
It was as though the windmill had never been.
As they approached the farm Squealer, who had unaccountably been absent during the fighting, came skipping towards them, whisking his tail and beaming with satisfaction.
And the animals heard, from the direction of the farm buildings, the solemn booming of a gun.
What is that gun firing for? said Boxer.
To celebrate our victory! cried Squealer.
What victory? said Boxer.
His knees were bleeding, he had lost a shoe and split his hoof, and a dozen pellets had lodged themselves in his hind leg.
What victory, comrade?
Have we not driven the enemy off our soil the sacred soil of Animal Farm?
But they have destroyed the windmill.
And we had worked on it for two years!
What matter?
We will build another windmill.
We will build six windmills if we feel like it.
You do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that we have done.
The enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we stand upon.
And now thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon we have won every inch of it back again!
Then we have won back what we had before, said Boxer.
That is our victory, said Squealer.
They limped into the yard.
The pellets under the skin of Boxers leg smarted painfully.
He saw ahead of him the heavy labour of rebuilding the windmill from the foundations, and already in imagination he braced himself for the task.
But for the first time it occurred to him that he was eleven years old and that perhaps his great muscles were not quite what they had once been.
But when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun firing again  seven times it was fired in all  and heard the speech that Napoleon made, congratulating them on their conduct, it did seem to them after all that they had won a great victory.
The animals slain in the battle were given a solemn funeral.
Boxer and Clover pulled the wagon which served as a hearse, and Napoleon himself walked at the head of the procession.
Two whole days were given over to celebrations.
There were songs, speeches, and more firing of the gun, and a special gift of an apple was bestowed on every animal, with two ounces of corn for each bird and three biscuits for each dog.
It was announced that the battle would be called the Battle of the Windmill, and that Napoleon had created a new decoration, the Order of the Green Banner, which he had conferred upon himself.
In the general rejoicings the unfortunate affair of the banknotes was forgotten.
It was a few days later than this that the pigs came upon a case of whisky in the cellars of the farmhouse.
It had been overlooked at the time when the house was occupied.
That night there came from the farmhouse the sound of loud singing, in which, to everyones surprise, the strains of Beasts of England were mixed up.
At about half past nine Napoleon, wearing an old bowler hat of Mr. Jones, was distinctly seen to emerge from the back door, gallop rapidly round the yard, and disappear in doors again.
But in the morning a deep silence hung over the farmhouse.
Not a pig appeared to be stirring.
It was nearly nine oclock when Squealer made his appearance, walking slowly and dejectedly, his eyes dull, his tail hanging limply behind him, and with every appearance of being seriously ill.
He called the animals together and told them that he had a terrible piece of news to impart.
Comrade Napoleon was dying!
A cry of lamentation went up.
Straw was laid down outside the doors of the farmhouse, and the animals walked on tiptoe.
With tears in their eyes they asked one another what they should do if their Leader were taken away from them.
A rumour went round that Snowball had after all contrived to introduce poison into Napoleons food.
At eleven oclock Squealer came out to make another announcement.
As his last act upon earth, Comrade Napoleon had pronounced a solemn decree: the drinking of alcohol was to be punished by death.
By the evening, however, Napoleon appeared to be somewhat better, and the following morning Squealer was able to tell them that he was well on the way to recovery.
By the evening of that day Napoleon was back at work, and on the next day it was learned that he had instructed Whymper to purchase in Willingdon some booklets on brewing and distilling.
It was a moonlit night.
At the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written, there lay a ladder broken in two pieces.
Squealer, temporarily stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near at hand there lay a lantern, a paintbrush, and an overturned pot of white paint.
The dogs immediately made a ring round Squealer, and escorted him back to the farmhouse as soon as he was able to walk.
None of the animals could form any idea as to what this meant, except old Benjamin, who nodded his muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed to understand, but would say nothing.
But a few days later Muriel, reading over the Seven Commandments to herself, noticed that there was yet another of them which the animals had remembered wrong.
They had thought the Fifth Commandment was No animal shall drink alcohol, but there were two words that they had forgotten.
Actually the Commandment read: No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.
Boxers split hoof was a long time in healing.
They had started the rebuilding of the windmill the day after the victory celebrations were ended.
Boxer refused to take even a day off work, and made it a point of honour not to let it be seen that he was in pain.
In the evenings he would admit privately to Clover that the hoof troubled him a great deal.
Clover treated the hoof with poultices of herbs which she prepared by chewing them, and both she and Benjamin urged Boxer to work less hard.
A horses lungs do not last for ever, she said to him.
But Boxer would not listen.
He had, he said, only one real ambition left  to see the windmill well under way before he reached the age for retirement.
At the beginning, when the laws of Animal Farm were first formulated, the retiring age had been fixed for horses and pigs at twelve, for cows at fourteen, for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, and for hens and geese at five.
Liberal old-age pensions had been agreed upon.
As yet no animal had actually retired on pension, but of late the subject had been discussed more and more.
Now that the small field beyond the orchard had been set aside for barley, it was rumoured that a corner of the large pasture was to be fenced off and turned into a grazing-ground for superannuated animals.
For a horse, it was said, the pension would be five pounds of corn a day and, in winter, fifteen pounds of hay, with a carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays.
Boxers twelfth birthday was due in the late summer of the following year.
Meanwhile life was hard.
The winter was as cold as the last one had been, and food was even shorter.
Once again all rations were reduced, except those of the pigs and the dogs.
A too rigid equality in rations, Squealer explained, would have been contrary to the principles of Animalism.
The animals believed every word of it.
Truth to tell, Jones and all he stood for had almost faded out of their memories.
They knew that life nowadays was harsh and bare, that they were often hungry and often cold, and that they were usually working when they were not asleep.
But doubtless it had been worse in the days of Jones.
They were glad to believe so.
Besides, in those days they had been slaves and now they were free.
That made all the difference, as Squealer did not fail to point out.
There were many more mouths to feed now.
Towards the end of summer the four sows had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young pigs between them.
The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was the only boar on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage.
It was announced that later, when bricks and timber had been purchased, a schoolroom would be built in the farmhouse garden.
For the time being, the young pigs were given their instruction by Napoleon himself in the farmhouse kitchen.
They took their exercise in the garden, and were discouraged from playing with the other young animals.
About this time, too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and any other animal met on the path, the other animal must stand aside: and also that all pigs, of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing green ribbons on their tails on Sundays.
The farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short of money.
There were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be purchased, and it would also be necessary to begin saving up again for the machinery for the windmill.
Then there were lamp oil and candles for the house, sugar for Napoleons own table (he forbade this to the other pigs, on the ground that it made them fat), and all the usual replacements such as tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap-iron, and dog biscuits.
A stump of hay and part of the potato crop were sold off, and the contract for eggs was increased to six hundred a week, so that that year the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at the same level.
Rations, reduced in December, were reduced again in February.
Lanterns in the stalls were forbidden to save oil.
But the pigs seemed comfortable enough, and in fact were putting on weight if anything.
Someone said it was the smell of cooking barley.
The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper.
But no warm mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced that from now onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs.
The field beyond the orchard had already been sown with barley.
And the news soon leaked out that every pig was now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily, with half a gallon for Napoleon himself, which was always served to him in the Crown Derby soup tureen.
But if there were hardships to be borne, they were partly offset by the fact that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had before.
There were more songs, more speeches, more processions.
Napoleon had commanded that once a week there should be held something called a Spontaneous Demonstration, the object of which was to celebrate the struggles and triumphs of Animal Farm.
At the appointed time the animals would leave their work and march round the precincts of the farm in military formation, with the pigs leading, then the horses, then the cows, then the sheep, and then the poultry.
The dogs flanked the procession and at the head of all marched Napoleons black cockerel.
Boxer and Clover always carried between them a green banner marked with the hoof and the horn and the caption, Long live Comrade Napoleon!
Afterwards there were recitations of poems composed in Napoleons honour, and a speech by Squealer giving particulars of the latest increases in the production of foodstuffs, and on occasion a shot was fired from the gun.
The sheep were the greatest devotees of the Spontaneous Demonstration, and if anyone complained (as a few animals sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were near) that they wasted time and meant a lot of standing about in the cold, the sheep were sure to silence him with a tremendous bleating of Four legs good, two legs bad!
But by and large the animals enjoyed these celebrations.
They found it comforting to be reminded that, after all, they were truly their own masters and that the work they did was for their own benefit.
So that, what with the songs, the processions, Squealers lists of figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the cockerel, and the fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that their bellies were empty, at least part of the time.
In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, and it became necessary to elect a President.
There was only one candidate, Napoleon, who was elected unanimously.
On the same day it was given out that fresh documents had been discovered which revealed further details about Snowballs complicity with Jones.
It now appeared that Snowball had not, as the animals had previously imagined, merely attempted to lose the Battle of the Cowshed by means of a stratagem, but had been openly fighting on Joness side.
In fact, it was he who had actually been the leader of the human forces, and had charged into battle with the words Long live Humanity! on his lips.
The wounds on Snowballs back, which a few of the animals still remembered to have seen, had been inflicted by Napoleons teeth.
In the middle of the summer Moses the raven suddenly reappeared on the farm, after an absence of several years.
He was quite unchanged, still did no work, and talked in the same strain as ever about Sugarcandy Mountain.
He would perch on a stump, flap his black wings, and talk by the hour to anyone who would listen.
Up there, comrades, he would say solemnly, pointing to the sky with his large beak  up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that you can see  there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest for ever from our labours!
He even claimed to have been there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and lump sugar growing on the hedges.
Many of the animals believed him.
Their lives now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it not right and just that a better world should exist somewhere else?
A thing that was difficult to determine was the attitude of the pigs towards Moses.
They all declared contemptuously that his stories about Sugarcandy Mountain were lies, and yet they allowed him to remain on the farm, not working, with an allowance of a gill of beer a day.
After his hoof had healed up, Boxer worked harder than ever.
Indeed, all the animals worked like slaves that year.
Apart from the regular work of the farm, and the rebuilding of the windmill, there was the schoolhouse for the young pigs, which was started in March.
Sometimes the long hours on insufficient food were hard to bear, but Boxer never faltered.
The others said, Boxer will pick up when the spring grass comes on; but the spring came and Boxer grew no fatter.
Sometimes on the slope leading to the top of the quarry, when he braced his muscles against the weight of some vast boulder, it seemed that nothing kept him on his feet except the will to continue.
At such times his lips were seen to form the words, I will work harder; he had no voice left.
Once again Clover and Benjamin warned him to take care of his health, but Boxer paid no attention.
His twelfth birthday was approaching.
He did not care what happened so long as a good store of stone was accumulated before he went on pension.
Late one evening in the summer, a sudden rumour ran round the farm that something had happened to Boxer.
He had gone out alone to drag a load of stone down to the windmill.
A few minutes later two pigeons came racing in with the news: Boxer has fallen! He is lying on his side and cant get up!
About half the animals on the farm rushed out to the knoll where the wind-mill stood.
There lay Boxer, between the shafts of the cart, his neck stretched out, unable even to raise his head.
His eyes were glazed, his sides matted with sweat.
A thin stream of blood had trickled out of his mouth.
Clover dropped to her knees at his side.
Boxer! she cried, how are you?
It is my lung, said Boxer in a weak voice.
It does not matter.
I think you will be able to finish the windmill without me.
There is a pretty good store of stone accumulated.
I had only another month to go in any case.
To tell you the truth, I had been looking forward to my retirement.
And perhaps, as Benjamin is growing old too, they will let him retire at the same time and be a companion to me.
We must get help at once, said Clover.
Run, somebody, and tell Squealer what has happened.
All the other animals immediately raced back to the farmhouse to give Squealer the news.
Only Clover remained, and Benjamin who lay down at
Boxers side, and, without speaking, kept the flies off him with his long tail.
After about a quarter of an hour Squealer appeared, full of sympathy and concern.
He said that Comrade Napoleon had learned with the very deepest distress of this misfortune to one of the most loyal workers on the farm, and was already making arrangements to send Boxer to be treated in the hospital at Willingdon.
The animals felt a little uneasy at this.
Except for Mollie and Snowball, no other animal had ever left the farm, and they did not like to think of their sick comrade in the hands of human beings. However, Squealer easily convinced them that the veterinary surgeon in Willingdon could treat Boxers case more satisfactorily than could be done on the farm.
And about half an hour later, when Boxer had somewhat recovered, he was with difficulty got on to his feet, and managed to limp back to his stall, where Clover and Benjamin had prepared a good bed of straw for him.
For the next two days Boxer remained in his stall.
The pigs had sent out a large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine chest in the bathroom, and Clover administered it to Boxer twice a day after meals.
In the evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him, while Benjamin kept the flies off him.
Boxer professed not to be sorry for what had happened.
If he made a good recovery, he might expect to live another three years, and he looked forward to the peaceful days that he would spend in the corner of the big pasture.
It would be the first time that he had had leisure to study and improve his mind.
He intended, he said, to devote the rest of his life to learning the remaining twenty-two letters of the alphabet.
However, Benjamin and Clover could only be with Boxer after working hours,and it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away.
The animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig, when they were astonished to see Benjamin come galloping from the direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice.
It was the first time that they had ever seen Benjamin excited  indeed, it was the first time that anyone had ever seen him gallop.
Quick, quick! he shouted.
Come at once! Theyre taking Boxer away!
Without waiting for orders from the pig, the animals broke off work and raced back to the farm buildings.
Sure enough, there in the yard was a large closed van, drawn by two horses, with lettering on its side and a sly-looking man in a low-crowned bowler hat sitting on the drivers seat.
Boxer’s stall was empty.
The animals crowded round the van.
Good-bye, Boxer! they chorused, good-bye!
Fools! Fools! shouted Benjamin, prancing round them and stamping the earth with his small hoofs.
See what is written?
That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush.
Muriel began to spell out the words.
But Benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly silence he read: Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon.
They are taking Boxer to the knackers!
A cry of horror burst from all the animals.
At this moment the man on the box whipped up his horses and the van moved out of the yard at a smart trot.
Boxer! cried Clover in a terrible voice. Boxer! Get out! Get out quickly!
Theyre taking you to your death!
All the animals took up the cry of Get out, Boxer, get out!
But the van was already gathering speed and drawing away from them.
It was uncertain whether Boxer had understood what Clover had said.
But a moment later his face disappeared from the window and there was the sound of a tremendous drumming of hoofs inside the van.
Too late, someone thought of racing ahead and shutting the five-barred gate.
But in another moment the van was through it and rapidly disappearing down the road.
Boxer was never seen again.
Three days later it was announced that he had died in the hospital at Willingdon, in spite of receiving every attention a horse could have.
Squealer came to announce the news to the others.
I was at his bedside at the very last.
And at the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my ear that his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was finished.
Long live Comrade Napoleon! Napoleon is always right.
Those were his very last words, comrades.
And when Squealer went on to give further graphic details of Boxers death-bed, the admirable care he had received, and the expensive medicines for which Napoleon had paid without a thought as to the cost, their last doubts disappeared and the sorrow that they felt for their comrades death was tempered by the thought that at least he had died happy.
Napoleon himself appeared at the meeting on the following Sunday morning and pronounced a short oration in Boxers honour.
It had not been possible, he said, to bring back their lamented comrades remains for interment on the farm, but he had ordered a large wreath to be made from the laurels in the farmhouse garden and sent down to be placed on Boxers grave.
And in a few days time the pigs intended to hold a memorial banquet in Boxers honour.
Napoleon ended his speech with a reminder of Boxers two favourite maxims, I will work harder and Comrade Napoleon is always right  maxims, he said, which every animal would do well to adopt as his own.
On the day appointed for the banquet, a grocers van drove up from Willingdon and delivered a large wooden crate at the farmhouse.
That night there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by what sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven oclock with a tremendous crash of glass.
No one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on the following day.
The word went round that from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky.
Years passed.
The seasons came and went, the short animal lives fled by.
A time came when there was no one who remembered the old days before the Rebellion, except Clover, Benjamin, Moses the raven, and a number of the pigs.
Muriel was dead; Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher were dead.
Jones too was dead  he had died in an inebriates home.
Snowball was forgotten.
Boxer was forgotten, except by the few who had known him.
Clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with a tendency to rheumy eyes.
She was two years past the retiring age, but in fact no animal had ever actually retired.
The talk of setting aside a corner of the pasture for superannuated animals had long since been dropped.
Napoleon was now a mature boar of twenty-four stone.
Squealer was so fat that he could with difficulty see out of his eyes.
Only old Benjamin was much the same as ever, except for being a little greyer about the muzzle, and, since Boxers death, more morose and taciturn than ever.
There were many more creatures on the farm now, though the increase was not so great as had been expected in earlier years.
Many animals had been born to whom the Rebellion was only a dim tradition, passed on by word of mouth, and others had been bought who had never heard mention of such a thing before their arrival.
The farm possessed three horses now besides Clover.
They were fine upstanding beasts, willing workers and good comrades, but very stupid.
None of them proved able to learn the alphabet beyond the letter B.
They accepted everything that they were told about the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism, especially from Clover.
The windmill had been successfully completed at last, and the farm possessed a threshing machine and a hay elevator of its own, and various new buildings had been added to it.
The windmill, however, had not after all been used for generating electrical power, but for milling corn, and brought in a handsome money profit.
The animals were hard at work building yet another windmill; when that one was finished, so it was said, the dynamos would be installed.
But the luxuries of which Snowball had once taught the animals to dream, the stalls with electric light and hot and cold water, and the three-day week, were no longer talked about.
Napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of Animalism.
The truest happiness, he said, lay in working hard and living frugally.
Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer  except, of course, for the pigs and the dogs.
Perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so many dogs.
It was not that these creatures did not work.
There was, as Squealer was never tired of explaining, endless work in the supervision and organisation of the farm.
Much of this work was of a kind that the other animals were too ignorant to understand.
For example, Squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things called files, reports, minutes, and memoranda. These were large sheets of paper which had to be closely covered with writing, and as soon as they were so covered, they were burnt in the furnace.
This was of the highest importance for the welfare of the farm, Squealer said.
But still, neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour; and there were very many of them, and their appetites were always good.
As for the others, their life, so far as they knew, was as it had always been.
They were generally hungry, they slept on straw, they drank from the pool, they laboured in the fields; in winter they were troubled by the cold, and in summer by the flies.
Sometimes the older ones among them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the early days of the Rebellion, when Jones’s expulsion was still recent, things had been better or worse than now.
They could not remember anything with which they could compare their present lives.
They had nothing to go upon except Squealers lists of figures, which invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better.
The animals found the problem insoluble; in any case, they had little time for speculating on such things now.
Only old Benjamin professed to remember every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been, nor ever could be much better or much worse  hunger, hardship, and disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of life.
And yet the animals never gave up hope.
More, they never lost, even for an instant, their sense of honour and privilege in being members of Animal Farm.
They were still the only farm in the whole county in all England, owned and operated by animals.
And when they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead, their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk turned always towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones, the writing of the Seven Commandments, the great battles in which the human invaders had been defeated.
None of the old dreams had been abandoned.
The Republic of the Animals which Major had foretold, when the green fields of England should be untrodden by human feet, was still believed in.
Some day it was coming: it might not be soon, it might not be within the lifetime of any animal now living, but still it was coming.
Even the tune of Beasts of England was perhaps hummed secretly here and there: at any rate, it was a fact that every animal on the farm knew it, though no one would have dared to sing it aloud.
It might be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as other animals.
If they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves.
No creature among them went upon two legs.
No creature called any other creature Master.
All animals were equal.
One day in early summer Squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and led them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm, which had become overgrown with birch saplings.
The sheep spent the whole day there browsing at the leaves under Squealers supervision.
In the evening he returned to the farmhouse himself, but, as it was warm weather, told the sheep to stay where they were.
It ended by their remaining there for a whole week, during which time the other animals saw nothing of them.
Squealer was with them for the greater part of every day.
He was, he said, teaching them to sing a new song, for which privacy was needed.
It was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm buildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard.
Startled, the animals stopped in their tracks.
It was Clovers voice.
She neighed again, and all the animals broke into a gallop and rushed into the yard.
Then they saw what Clover had seen.
It was a pig walking on his hind legs.
Yes, it was Squealer.
A little awkwardly, as though not quite used to supporting his considerable bulk in that position, but with perfect balance, he was strolling across the yard.
And a moment later, out from the door of the farm-house came a long file of pigs, all walking on their hind legs.
Some did it better than others, one or two were even a trifle unsteady and looked as though they would have liked the support of a stick, but every one of them made his way right round the yard successfully.
And finally there was a tremendous baying of dogs and a shrill crowing from the black cockerel, and out came Napoleon himself, majestically upright, casting haughty glances from side to side, and with his dogs gambolling round him.
He carried a whip in his trotter.
There was a deadly silence.
Amazed, terrified, huddling together, the animals watched the long line of pigs march slowly round the yard.
All the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!
It went on for five minutes without stopping.
And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse.
Benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder.
He looked round.
He saw Clover.
Her old eyes looked dimmer than ever.
Without saying anything, she tugged gently at his mane and led him round to the end of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written.
For a minute or two they stood gazing at the tatted wall with its white lettering.
My sight is failing, she said finally.
Even when I was young I could not have read what was written there.
But it appears to me that that wall looks different.
Are the Seven Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?
For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her what was written on the wall.
There was nothing there now except a single commandment.
It ran:
ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL.
BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS.
After that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters.
It did not seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a wireless set, were arranging to install a telephone, and had taken out subscriptions to several newspapers.
It did not seem strange when Napoleon was seen strolling in the farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth  no, not even when the pigs took Mr. Jones’s clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on, Napoleon himself appearing in a black coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings, while his favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which Mrs Jones had been used to wear on Sundays.
A week later, in the afternoon, a number of dogcarts drove up to the farm.
A deputation of neighbouring farmers had been invited to make a tour of inspection.
They were shown all over the farm, and expressed great admiration for everything they saw, especially the windmill.
The animals were weeding the turnip field.
What could be happening in there, now that for the first time animals and human beings were meeting on terms of equality?
With one accord they began to creep as quietly as possible into the farmhouse garden.
At the gate they paused, half frightened to go on but Clover led the way in.
They tiptoed up to the house, and such animals as were tall enough peered in at the dining-room window.
There, round the long table, sat half a dozen farmers and half a dozen of the more eminent pigs.
Napoleon himself occupying the seat of honour at the head of the table.
The pigs appeared completely at ease in their chairs.
The company had been enjoying a game of cards but had broken off for the moment, evidently in order to drink a toast.
A large jug was circulating, and the mugs were being refilled with beer.
No one noticed the wondering faces of the animals that gazed in at the window.
Mr. Pilkington, of Foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand.
In a moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink a toast.
But before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent upon him to say.
It was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said  and, he was sure, to all others present to feel that a long period of mistrust and misunderstanding had now come to an end.
There had been a time  not that he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments  but there had been a time when the respected proprietors of Animal Farm had been regarded, he would not say with hostility, but perhaps with a certain measure of misgiving, by their human neighbours.
Unfortunate incidents had occurred, mistaken ideas had been current.
It had been felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neighbourhood.
Too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry, that on such a farm a spirit of licence and indiscipline would prevail.
They had been nervous about the effects upon their own animals, or even upon their human employees.
But all such doubts were now dispelled.
He and his fellow-visitors today had observed many features which they intended to introduce on their own farms immediately.
He would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the friendly feelings that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between Animal Farm and its neighbours.
And now, he said finally, he would ask the company to rise to their feet and make certain that their glasses were full.
Gentlemen, he concluded, gentlemen, I give you a toast: To the prosperity of Animal Farm!
There was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet.
Napoleon was so gratified that he left his place and came round the table to clink his mug against Mr Pilkingtons before emptying it.
When the cheering had died down, Napoleon, who had remained on his feet, intimated that he too had a few words to say.
Like all of Napoleons speeches, it was short and to the point.
He too, he said, was happy that the period of misunderstanding was at an end.
For a long time there had been rumours  circulated, he had reason to think, by some malignant enemy that there was something subversive and even revolutionary in the outlook of himself and his colleagues.
This farm which he had the honour to control, was a co-operative enterprise.
The title-deeds, which were in his own possession, were owned by the pigs jointly.
But as the animals outside gazed at the scene, it seemed to them that some strange thing was happening.
What was it that had altered in the faces of the pigs?
Clovers old dim eyes flitted from one face to another.
Some of them had five chins, some had four, some had three.
Some of the things were melting and changing.
Then, the applause having come to an end, the company took up their cards and continued the game that had been interrupted, and the animals crept silently away.
But they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short.
An uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse.
They rushed back and looked through the window again.
Yes, a violent quarrel was in progress.
There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials.

Once when a Lion was asleep, a little Mouse began running up and down upon him.
This soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him and opened his big jaws to swallow him.
"Pardon, O King!" cried the little Mouse, "Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. And who knows, but I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days?"
The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go.
Sometime later a few hunters captured the King and tied him to a tree while they went in search of a wagon to carry him on.
Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad plight in which the Lion was, ran up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts.
"Was I not right?" said the little Mouse, very happy to help the Lion.

A high court judge has given doctors permission to perform an urgent caesarean section on a mentally ill woman who has diabetes.
Mr Justice Hayden gave specialists working for the Royal Free London NHS Trust the go-ahead after a five-hour hearing in the court of protection in London.
The judge said a decision "compelling" a caesarean was "draconian", but he had heard evidence that the woman's life might be in danger.
He said he had concluded that the woman, who is 32 and 32 weeks pregnant, lacked the mental capacity to make decisions about whether or not to have her baby delivered by C-section.
Trust officials had applied for permission, saying doctors thought an urgent caesarean necessary so that the woman's "unstable mental state" could properly be treated.
One specialist told the judge that the priority was "keeping this woman alive".
He heard that she was thought to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and had attempted suicide.
The judge said neither the woman nor the hospital could be identified, but said the health authority could and should be named.
He said the scrutiny of doctors' conduct could only "serve to reassure public confidence".
The court of protection is part of the high court and analyses issues relating to sick and vulnerable people.
"The decision to compel a caesarean section on an incapacitous woman who is mentally and physically ill is an extremely draconian one," said Mr Justice Hayden.
"Doctors do not embark upon this lightly.
It occurs extremely rarely.
It is one that the lawyers also take very seriously indeed.
I am perfectly satisfied that at the moment this woman is not able to make any reasoned evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of a caesarean section.
He said he had also concluded that the woman – who had stopped eating – lacked the capacity to regulate her own diabetic medicine and monitor her own intake of food and water.
But doctors were not given permission to use force or restrain the woman.
Medics thought that the woman could be persuaded to agree to sedation and did not think that force or restraint would be needed, said the judge.
One doctor told the court that the woman's physical and mental problems should lessen – and be easier to treat – once the baby was born.
And the doctor said it was feared that the woman might have to have to be restrained so that nutrients could be fed through a drip if the baby was not delivered.
A specialist said the baby should not be at risk if delivered via caesarean section at 32 weeks.
I don't like to go to the hospital.
The doctor gave him an injection.
