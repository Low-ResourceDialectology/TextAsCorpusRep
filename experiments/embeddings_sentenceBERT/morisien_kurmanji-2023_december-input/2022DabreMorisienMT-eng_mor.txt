already
already i’m disrupting my arrangement with lindsey
already the price sugar was bringing was not increasing in real terms nor in comparison with increases in the price of imports
already the rupee is depreciating rapidly relative to the euro and the pound sterling and this is bringing inflation
already there are more and more investments in these kinds of private institutions which means in fact privatizing services that were a right under the welfare state
alright and are you guys ready to order food or should i give you couple of minutes
alright and when would you like to leave
alright ive made that reservation for you and how will you be arriving
also
also an especially rich group for folklore study is members of the same occupation — sugar estate docks school
also be recorded do people laugh sing clap
also bear in mind questions like these
also fancy fairs have undergone change over the last generation song competitions for instance used to be part of every program but now they don’t appear as much
also in your home community you could make a list of the folk groups schoolchildren married women unmarried men and ofcourse families
also performance today is different from performance yesterday
also the recent entry of thousands of women into the textile factories airlines hotels and restaurants of mauritius means the creation of new folk traditions — speech custom song
also what is crucial is that equally from the side of the bourgeoisie in mauritius if the crisis of the sugar industry is the crisis of the rest of the bourgeoisie then we can expect that we are dealing not with the responses of the sugar oligarchy or the textile bosses but we are dealing with the responses of the entire bourgeoisie

although i am hoping to stick quite closely to the notes that i made so that lindsey can translate and sum up my notes i do have to start with two small digressions
although we should put on record that clearly all studies in the entire world as you well know have already proved beyond all doubt that mother tongue instruction produces better results in all subjects from science to additional languages from subjects that involve creativity to subject that demand reasoning

and
and a half
and a moment later out from the door of the farmhouse came a long file of pigs all walking on their hind legs
and about half an hour later when boxer had somewhat recovered he was with difficulty got on to his feet and managed to limp back to his stall where clover and benjamin had prepared a good bed of straw for him
and above all no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind
and above all pass on this message of mine to those who come after you so that future generations shall carry on the struggle until it is victorious
and again 
and again since no animal now stole it was unnecessary to fence off pasture from arable land which saved a lot of labour on the upkeep of hedges and gates
and all the measures in the world to assure shortterm profitability for the sugar estates will not suffice to rectify that scale of price reduction
and among us animals let there be perfect unity perfect comradeship in the struggle
and are there any special exhibitions on right now
and as the two sections of the bourgeoisie go into conflict the prime minister attacks the historic bourgeoisie and at the same time attacks the unions
and as to the battle of the cowshed i believe the time will come when we shall find that snowball’s part in it was much exaggerated
and as you know in our country no boss ever has the capacity to pay
and at the end almost too weak to speak he whispered in my ear that his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was finished
and at the same time in the context of the present debate on electoral reform and constitutional amendment and in response to imperialist and private capitalist interests clearly targeting mauritian islands and land to work towards giving concrete expression to the chagossians participation in the democratic setup of the country
and at this point something very important happens the people who have already mobilized behind the demands find that the more they mobilize the more explanations they have to develop the more debates they win the more resistance hardens against these demands and this means you have further opportunities to argue in favour of your demands
and by the time the sheep had quieted down the chance to utter any protest had passed for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse
and does our program speak to the peasantry
and especially they make you believe that all private property is the same thing
and even in the development of the program itself as i mentioned it isn’t a question of sitting and writing something
and even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their natural span
and finally there was a tremendous baying of dogs and a shrill crowing from the black cockerel and out came napoleon himself majestically upright casting haughty glances from side to side and with his dogs gambolling round him
and for a little while they halted in sorrowful silence at the place where the windmill had once stood
and for local flights
and for the three next years this same crisis will deepen further into a cataclysm
and from all this disorder human beings have to forge something new
and from then on he adopted the maxim napoleon is always right in addition to his private motto of will work harder
and he cut off the lamb’s head in one blow
and he did help me
and he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry
and he started off like an arrow
and he very nearly succeeded i will even say comrades he would have succeeded if it had not been for our heroic leader comrade napoleon
and he will bring justice to the nations
and how do you like new york
and how long does the tour last once it starts
and how many blocks is that from here
and how much does that cost
and how much is the admission
and i think again importantly and this again makes the party crucial is that from one successive wave in this alternating tempo to the next there are important changes in the psychology of the working class
and i think it is important as we enter a period of crisis that we do not repeat the mistakes of some of us in the struggle in south africa who said apartheid cannot end without the end of capitalism
and i think there are important debates and discussions in the history of revolutionary strategy
and i think there is the need for a lot of debate about the fact that the crisis is extended and that the existence of a crisis does not always imply that the working class is ready everyday to have a march in the streets
and i was a long way away but i am alvmost certain i saw this he was talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose
and if we are not careful in 5 years’ time we will hear people saying “ramgoolam lied to us bérenger is saying ‘put people really first’ bérenger is finally talking sense let’s vote for bérenger” laughter if we aren’t careful this is what is going to happen once again
and in a few days time the pigs intended to hold a memorial banquet in boxers honour
and in his spare moments of which there were not many nowadays he would go alone to the quarry collect a load of broken stone and drag it down to the site of the windmill unassisted
and in lpt we have always been promoting education as a right
and in many ways the animal method of doing things was more efficient and saved labour
and in mauritius
and in our electoral campaign it was the political program for an alternative economy which was really the pillar of our electoral campaign whether on radio on television or in our indoor meetings or public outdoor meetings we held
and in particular the awards or remuneration orders that the nrb and prb come up with so as to determine minimum wages for each sector at any time will be done away with
and in rebuilding it they could not this time as before make use of the fallen stones
and in school you are responsible for systematically hampering the crucial natural development of childrens intelligence through their own mother tongue
and in those moments you find out that the structure of these parties of one of the parties within that block requires support and therefore it begins to fish outside the usual support for the ruling block and look for possible allies in the reorganization of the ruling block
and in what way can we therefore say what sections we expect to move in the direction of our program
and it can be found in more than one story like the man who is really a wolf
and it does it through “crises”
and it has since converting agricultural land into rich men’s ghettoes made windfall gains in real estate
and it is government that should be made to take the initiative
and it is governments who negotiate sugar prices with european governments and the eu
and it is important for the way that we conduct our struggle
and it is not just lalit saying so anymore
and it is not just lalit that says so the bosses and government have finally come around to agreeing that that is the case the sugar industry has no future free zonestyle development has none either there will be further mass sackings with new vrs the socalled voluntary retirement schemes that are all but compulsory and with further mill closures unemployment can be expected to continue to rise recently prime minister berenger was so hetup about the rate of unemployment that he took to blaming the central statistical office for it accusing them of not calculating accurately
and it is working people and the poor who are suffering the worst effects of these upheavals
and it seems that on some questions like the tax on the lump sums sithanen is making concessions
and it will become urgent now that we aim together with other organizations and other people at setting up a political program not just for the sugar industry and the free zones but at setting up a political program that aims to bring about a thorough change in the whole of society – economic political and social
and it would
and i’m not talking about political parties which are reformist those that are abandoning the working class
and just in the same way as if someone steals your motorbike the police will open an inquiry so in exactly the same way if you steal the bosses’ sugar mill you will also have to be locked up or shot at
and just where do you have this egg from boy
and lastly this program must spell out a political strategy of mobilization
and look there’s a boat coming through
and many materials to treat it such as herbal medicine
and more importantly it is you that will have been responsible and thus you who will have this harm on your conscience for the rest of your life
and more importantly you will be responsible for an immense harm done to children
and not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful
and now comrades i will tell you about my dream of last night
and now he said finally he would ask the company to rise to their feet and make certain that their glasses were full
and now thanks to the leadership of comrade napoleon we have won every inch of it back again
and now the crucial political character of the party comes in
and now today the bosses and the government have come forward to begin to admit that their project is a failure
and now your temple will be deserted
and obviously on the question of private property it is safe to say that the totality of the legal system protects it
and of course equally important is an analysis of how is the crisis restructuring the dominated classes
and of course there is the postponement of the retirement age to 65
and of course with the intention of intervening in the way that block either fractures or is able to be maintained
and off he went
and once you have been formally informed by this letter you cannot then continue the same harmful policies
and people who now disobey god will begin to think as they ought to
and perhaps as benjamin is growing old too they will let him retire at the same time and be a companion to me
and pray that you wont have to escape in winter or on a sabbath
and protect us from evil
and remember also that in fighting against man we must not come to resemble him
and remember comrades your resolution must never falter
and remembering that kaya’s death unelucidated up to today is not the first case of suspicious death in police cells
and salomon as well
and shake the dust from your feet at them
and shall i still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane asked mollie
and so almost before they knew what was happening the rebellion had been successfully carried through jones was expelled and the manor farm was theirs
and so early every morning he kept the lump of gold for himself
and so in bourgeois economics when you learn about economics you learn about the business cycles which means basically an acceptance that it is in the very nature of the capitalist economy to have crises to have these periodic breakdowns
and so the tale of confessions and executions went on until there was a pile of corpses lying before napoleons feet and the air was heavy with the smell of blood which had been unknown there since the expulsion of jones
and sometimes the debate also scouts around the edges of the equally important question of privatization
and sometimes until today i wonder if that would not have been better for me because i remained miserable at school right through to college
and sometimes we get a strong man emerging to stitch up everyone
and squealer who happened to be passing at this moment attended by two or three dogs was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective
and thanks for buying me lunch
and that day was the last time i ever saw a cricket in mauritius turned into a cow
and that in order to advance the three causes stated just following the first paragraph above as well as the specific demands then enumerated in this declaration we commit ourselves to building up broad support on a national and international level
and that in the context of these demands we call on the president of the republic the last living witness to the preindependence negotiations held at lancaster house to come forward to give public testimony
and that is in fact exactly what is happening right now
and that power balance in strategic terms is what holds the players in society together
and that this group is just greedy
and that to advance these aims and given that there are some actions that can be set in motion only by the state of mauritius
and that was the last time i ever saw him at the market
and thats not all
and that’s how i earned a nice sum of money”
and the animals heard from the direction of the farm buildings the solemn booming of a gun
and the banquet room was filled with guests
and the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar
and the bosses now openly promise worse to come
and the crisis is a problem
and the criticism begins to swing over from daytoday problems from daytoday concerns with personalities to a much more historical criticism
and the disorder has spread
and the doctor said it was feared that the woman might have to have to be restrained so that nutrients could be fed through a drip if the baby was not delivered
and the door will be opened for everyone who knocks
and the important point again is that the role of the party is to keep in the minds of the working class the continuity of the crisis
and the important point is that if you do get left behind don’t get paralyzed
and the leaves were bitter in her mouth
and the news soon leaked out that every pig was now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily with half a gallon for napoleon himself which was always served to him in the crown derby soup tureen
and the sea is very very big
and then after a few preliminary tries the whole farm burst out into beasts of england in tremendous unison
and then i make a left on beverly
and then in society these individual plans are integrated in an anarchic fashion
and then the merrygoround just continues
and then when we hear the budget being discussed we keep hearing the name percy mistry coming up
and then you end up saying “it’s quite natural they are owners of property and i am also an owner of property because i’ve got a motorbike i own my house so it’s a just law and we have a fine constitution”
and thereafter he declared so much labour would be saved that the animals would only need to work three days a week
and therefore a concrete analysis of how the crisis is reorganizing the social weight of the different sections of the working class and the implications that this has for strategy for the forms of organizing for the kinds of traditional practices that we have inherited from past instances of struggle
and therefore every so often even in bourgeois economic literature it has now become accepted that crises are a normal part of capitalism
and these two sons could both read since they had been to the government school
and they are putting lots of emphasis on these sme’s in his budget
and they did not predict that the two crises would happen at the same time either
and they get mowed down one by one and this is where demoralization translates to the other sectors
and they put these two kinds of ownership on the same level
and they sometimes have very different traditions of organizing they have different strengths and different psyches of combativity
and they will be right to think you’re crazy laughter
and they will tell others
and this cow was so thin that one day it died
and this is a list of his ancestors
and this is how in history you do find that you can take power through mobilization and not just take power by some coup d’etat or through a guerrilla war which then gets declared “socialism”
and this is not an isolated case
and this is the kind of consciousness that develops during the course of a number of conflicts
and this may just be the most difficult task of all
and this means that the budget must face up to this and suggest alternative sectors alternative ways of creating employment of keeping jobs secure and of how to create jobs fast
and this pressure will be even stronger than usual because according to the financial secretary the interim one anyway ally mansoor negotiations have already begun for a big new world bank loan
and this privatization involves dismantling the provisions of the welfare state
and this when it is the worker who is losing his job his income and his means to feed his family
and those sectors might not be organized or structured in a way that they used to be in the old sectors
and though no one cared to mention it in the hearing of the pigs or the dogs it was felt that the killings which had taken place did not square with this
and to amend the constitution so as to outlaw the setting up of any military bases on any mauritian territory in future
and today in the context of the world kreol language day we are making a formal and public appeal to you to stop killing childrens mother tongues in school through the politics of excluding mauritian kreol and mauritian bhojpuri from schools thus forcing children to change from their own linguistic group to the group of another
and until now there are no little mice nor any great big rats living in zan and mariliz’ shop anymore
and very comfortable beds they are too
and we delegate six people the undersigned to present this declaration of grande rivière to the minister of foreign affairs and also to make the declaration public
and we had worked on it for two years
and we remember when government finally respected the demand for equal work for equal pay for women and men they lowered the men’s wages to the level of the women’s then there was “equality” the same thing will be happening again
and we worked in the hot sun all day long
and what about the gloves
and what do you do back home
and what do you think happened
and what does this say about the capacity of the party to emerge with prestige
and what has happened to that milk which should have been breeding up sturdy calves
and what is more the words of the song also came back  words i am certain which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations
and what outcome can we expect from a political campaign on the basis of these demands
and what this produces then as the crisis unfolds is the difficulty of synchronization between these different sections we are talking about
and what time does it open tomorrow
and whats the purpose of your visit to the united states
and when comrades discuss this we think it found its sharpest expression in the “july days” in petrograd in the russian revolution
and when does the flight get in to singapore
and when he got to the top with no more steps left he said “two rupees you can see that i can’t go any higher”
and when squealer went on to give further graphic details of boxers deathbed the admirable care he had received and the expensive medicines for which napoleon had paid without a thought as to the cost their last doubts disappeared and the sorrow that they felt for their comrades death was tempered by the thought that at least he had died happy
and when the human beings listened to it they secretly trembled hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom
and when the nine dogs of napoleons own bodyguard whom he had instructed to make a detour under cover of the hedge suddenly appeared on the mens flank baying ferociously panic overtook them
and when the others came back from looking for her it was to find that the stablelad who in fact was only stunned had already recovered and made off
and when they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead their hearts swelled with imperishable pride and the talk turned always towards the old heroic days the expulsion of jones the writing of the seven commandments the great battles in which the human invaders had been defeated
and when they thought of how they had laboured what discouragements they had overcome and the enormous difference that would be made in their lives when the sails were turning and the dynamos running  when they thought of all this their tiredness forsook them and they gambolled round and round the windmill uttering cries of triumph
and when we analyse the logic inherent in capitalist globalisation in regard to what is happening now we can see that this economic crisis is part of the very logic of the system
and when you get to beverly blvd turn right
and whenever workers have risen up in rebellion against the bosses and the government then and only then has the government seen fit to intervene the colonial government introduced the first oldage pensions and the village election system after the rebellions of 1937 and 1943 then around the mobilization for independence it introduced permanent employment on sugar estates from 1964 and nationalized one sugar estate rosebelle and the ceb new labour laws and the system of awards were introduced under pressure government forced the bosses to recognize the sugar sector trade unions silu and uasi after the august 79 general strike laws were introduced to prohibit the estates from having their own shops for their workers and later forced the estates to close down the system of tied housing
and while they were there she gave birth to her firstborn son
and why not
and with great sensitivity to the port
and with the russians again to whom we owe so much though they are impoverished nowadays there was a whole debate on what we call the theory of the “offensive”
and would you like fries with that
and yet against their will they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs
and yet khadija who had grown up in the capital went to high school passed her exams and was admitted to university overseas which was rare in those days
and yet the animals never gave up hope
and yet the historic bourgeoisie expects support of the state to go on and on
and yet the song was irrepressible
and you are nothing but showoffs isaiah the prophet was right when he wrote that god had said
and you clover where are those four foals you bore who should have been the support and pleasure of your old age
and you hens how many eggs have you laid in this last year and how many of those eggs ever hatched into chickens
and you slowpoke when will you return
and you will be able to do even more

another head lifts itself up
another issue is how do we respond when these different sections of the working class take these solo attempts
another major rupture was that of 1976 soweto students’ uprising we went on to a major crisis in 198083 and further on to another one in 1985 which was followed by a chain of other crises in the “homelands” at the tail end of the 1980s at the beginning of the 1990’s
another measure encourages integrated resorts scheme irs projects and extends the scope of the previous irs
another measure in the budget that we judge to be important is that the government is to bring in a law to decrease the notice a boss gives before sacking you

another point is an analysis of the internal structure of the working class and how that is being changed as the organic economic crisis unfolds in time
another reason is the prominence that is held by cultural festivals based in religion like cavadee ganga snan maha shivaratree chinese new year and eid—uladha
another thing of course is that a crisis is a shakeup in the relations of the entire society

as a folklore collectoryou need a willingness to listen at length to peoples stories about themselves their discussions their comments and the principles they imply
as clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears
as comrade ram seegobin explained the crisis is imminent
as for
as for cattle rearing the situation is similar
as for sita auntie she was like sita in the ramayana
as for sita auntie—i dont know why i still called her auntie—she knew how to build women’s confidence so that they could begin to take their fate into their own hands
as for the dogs when they grow old and toothless jones ties a brick round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond
as for the horses they knew every inch of the field and in fact understood the business of mowing and raking far better than jones and his men had ever done
as for the others their life so far as they knew was as it had always been
as for the pigs they could already read and write perfectly
as for you the observer you cannot be everywhere at the same time you can’t even see everything directly in front of you a videocamera will see less than you see yourself and yet you are expected to record whatever is relevant to an accurate description of the whole ceremony
as from about 1950 the labour party in fact represented the planters who were partly in conflict with the estates but who also had an interest in the continued production of sugar
as from now
as from now
as from the moment
as goes the saying
as he had said his voice was hoarse but he sang well enough and it was a stirring tune something between clementine and la cucaracha
as he was resting there he heard a noise – clipclop clipclop a band of forty thieves on their horses was coming
as his last act upon earth comrade napoleon had pronounced a solemn decree the drinking of alcohol was to be punished by death
as i have said perhaps for the first time the people will really be hit by globalisation when for example they go to buy bread in the morning when they send their children off to school each weekday when they are looking for a job for their 1617 years old children wherever we turn we will be forced to understand what a crisis is
as i mentioned there are measures that will cause land speculation speculation will be done relative to land conversion one type of use to another parceling and through opening the land market to international buyers
as i think when we get nearer 2009 when the whole issue of the money for sugar comes up
as i was saying i was born on the first of january
as i will be explaining later a demand can be valuable but not necessarily valuable at a particular time in history

as it is that is a waste of resources just encouraging people to take loans to go into debt when you know most of them will go bankrupt before five years is over
as little as i am if i fight with you i will bet i can beat you
as long ago as in 198283 lalit was already in the middle of a campaign to warn of the dangers of leaving the sugar oligarchs to dictate agricultural politics of the whole country what happened then was that we bumped into state repression
as long ago as in 198384 lalit was already in the middle of a campaign to warn of the dangers of leaving the sugar oligarchs to dictate agricultural politics of the whole country what happened then was that we bumped into state repression
as long as
as long as land will be under private control it will be very difficult to get the degree of food security that is essential for the people
as luck has it the russians resolved that problem and they managed to catch up with the mass and move in step with it
as marx said capitalism is a kind of anarchy
as one anthropologist points out about language in the caribbean speakers and addressees are not and probably are not encouraged to expect to become members of the same social group
as people realize this this is what makes the masses of the people stand up for the program
as per
as ram seegobin said in his paper earlier there is a need to develop a program not only on the economy not only on difficulties facing workers but also on all the other social aspects of the crisis as it unfolds
as soon as
as soon as jesus left the meeting place with james and john they went home with simon and andrew
as soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a fluttering all through the farm buildings
as soon as they were weaned napoleon took them away from their mothers saying that he would make himself responsible for their education
as soon as they were well inside the yard the three horses the three cows and the rest of the pigs who had been lying in ambush in the cowshed suddenly emerged in their rear cutting them off
as soon as you find him let me know
as suggested before take careful note of people’s actual behavior record exactly what they say and be on the lookout for variant forms of belief custom and statement
as the human beings approached the farm buildings snowball launched his first attack
as the minister in charge of education you are responsible for children who go to school in mauritius rodrigues and agalega
as the summer wore on and the windmill neared completion the rumours of an impending treacherous attack grew stronger and stronger
as the union movement is in this important battle against government another battle looms on the horizon the replacement of existing industrial relations legislation
as they approached the farm squealer who had unaccountably been absent during the fighting came skipping towards them whisking his tail and beaming with satisfaction
as things deteriorated the violence started to cast its net much wider
as though the man is an oracle
as to the segapeople in mauritius have been declaring it dead or dying since 1830
as usual snowball and napoleon were in disagreement
as we forgive others
as we see in south africa at the moment what the zuma affair really comes down to is the fact that the structure within the ruling block of ancsacpcosatu finds labour wanting to latch on to one part of that block as a way of resolving its own crisis
as well as wind power being an enormous potential there is also power production from the movement of the sea which is ideal for islands like mauritius rodrigues and agalega
as winter drew on mollie became more and more troublesome
as yet no animal had actually retired on pension but of late the subject had been discussed more and more
as you can see once schooling becomes compulsory you as minister have additional responsibilities not to hard children
as you continue to observe the ceremony you will reshape this sentencebut always bear in mind that you final paper must defend this single central idea
as you go announce that the kingdom of god will soon be here

at a moment when the opening was clear the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main road
at a stretch
at a wedding
at about half past nine napoleon wearing an old bowler hat of mr jones was distinctly seen to emerge from the back door gallop rapidly round the yard and disappear in doors again
at about the same time it was given out that napoleon had arranged to sell the pile of timber to mr pilkington he was also going to enter into a regular agreement for the exchange of certain products between animal farm and foxwood
at all costs
at an initiation
at any cost
at cavadee
at certain times in the evolution of the crisis we find that certain elements of the historical bloc in order to resolve their own disagreements within the block begin to organize outside the ruling block
at eleven oclock squealer came out to make another announcement
at every fancy fair you find several of the same things over and over games a flea market of donated clothes prepared food predictable dishes like briani beer and plenty of public drinking
at every few steps napoleon stopped and snuffed the ground for traces of snowball’s footsteps which he said he could detect by the smell
at fault
at fault
at first
at first i was very worried about closing the smf garage because i wondered what we could then do with people like assistant superintendent raddhoa laughter where could he then be transferred to to keep him out of contact with the public so as to curb him and his brutal team of investigators
at first it was a little difficult to see how this fitted in with his being on jones’s side
at first no one had been able to imagine where these creatures came from but the problem was soon solved they were the puppies whom napoleon had taken away from their mothers and reared privately
at first the inhabitants of camp mimi weren’t sure but then they were taken in by money’s power of reasoning
at first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of animals managing a farm for themselves
at halfmast
at heart each of them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn jones’ misfortune to his own advantage
at last
at last feeling this to be in some way a substitute for the words she was unable to find she began to sing beasts of england
at last the day came when snowball’s plans were completed
at last the woman died
at last they could stand it no longer
at latest
at least
at least three months later the king saw him coming from far off
at midday the sky turned dark and stayed that way until three oclock
at most
at most
at most the government has sometimes intervened so as to ensure a bit of extra profit from cane and sugar for the bosses
at night the rocks stay warm until quite late
at once his servant was healed
at once the curtain in the temple was torn in two from top to bottom
at once the fig tree dried up
at once the leprosy disappeared and he was well
at once the mans leprosy disappeared
at once the two brothers dropped their nets and went with him
at once they left their nets and followed him
at one end of the big barn on a sort of raised platform major was already ensconced on his bed of straw under a lantern which hung from a beam
at one of those meetings — i dont really remember if it was a social one or a working session — i got a real surprise
at present
at seven o’clock they open up the shop
at such times his lips were seen to form the words i will work harder he had no voice left
at table
at that moment her daughter was healed
at that moment jesus said
at that moment she was healed
at that time the revolutionary forces were exhausted were defeated there was fear in the country then you have the first outbreak of popular dissent against apartheid amongst the university students
at that time you will be given the words to say
at the appointed time the animals would leave their work and march round the precincts of the farm in military formation with the pigs leading then the horses then the cows then the sheep and then the poultry
at the beginning they met with much stupidity and apathy
at the beginning when the laws of animal farm were first formulated the retiring age had been fixed for horses and pigs at twelve for cows at fourteen for dogs at nine for sheep at seven and for hens and geese at five
at the edge of a gorge called grande ravine
at the end of the 19th century there thus came the time of “parcellization” when estate sold marginal land to planters who would provide them with cane in return
at the first step of the ladder he said “seven rupees”
at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the seven commandments were written there lay a ladder broken in two pieces
at the gate they paused half frightened to go on but clover led the way in
at the graveside snowball made a little speech emphasising the need for all animals to be ready to die for animal farm if need be
at the last moment mollie the foolish pretty white mare who drew mr jones’s trap came mincing daintily in chewing at a lump of sugar
at the level of
at the level of the african continent the process of decolonization is more advanced in 1987 the language plan of action initiated by the oua now incorporated into the african union one of its documents spoke out for the use of african languages as official language and as medium in education
at the meeting on the following sunday the question of whether or not to begin work on the windmill was to be put to the vote
at the meetings snowball often won over the majority by his brilliant speeches but napoleon was better at canvassing support for himself in between times
at the moment government is putting all its efforts into “diplomacy” to try to put off or decrease the amplitude of the price reduction that europe has already announced and to negotiate some sort of temporary “compensation”
at the moment it is more appropriate than it has been until now that is to say it has become relatively easy to put into question the logic of capitalist globalization and the logic of capitalism itself
at the moment when jack bizlall swaleh kasenally jean mée desvaux are arguing it is mainly about the cost of production
at the point of death
at the rate of
at the same time he warned them that after this treacherous deed the worst was to be expected
at the same time mill concentration and mechanization of the fields went ahead full steam supposedly to lower production costs
at the same time napoleon assured the animals that the stories of an impending attack on animal farm were completely untrue and that the tales about fredericks cruelty to his own animals had been greatly exaggerated
at the same time social action when it means consolidating effective lobbies can become the basis of poltical success
at the same time the government must invest in the barachois fish breeding in marine farms and the transformation of marine products not only a “seafood hub” that will be like a fish freezone
at the same time there were renewed rumours that frederick and his men were plotting to attack animal farm and to destroy the windmill the building of which had aroused furious jealousy in him
at the same time we believe that the new generation of “ecological rights” gives us a basic right to an unpolluted environment
at the same time with the pollution being caused by “fossilfuels” and with the sugar industry responsible for bagasse imploding lalit is thus launching a double element in this campaign no to privatization of the ceb and pressure for ceb to turn to research and massive investment in sources of modern clean and genuinely renewable energy
at the same time you need not expect that people can explain themselves or their traditions
at the second bus stop the same thing happens
at the side of the river he found a woman who was trying to drink water with her hands and he said to her “woman woman you must be silly to drink water with your hands here is a coconut”
at the sight several men dropped their sticks and tried to run
at the start or end of each bit you record state the name ageand place ofthe persons whose words are being written down
at the third the bus just drives on
at the time in lalit de klas we criticized the concept of “selfreliance” as one that was backward looking
at the very least
at the very least
at this moment the man on the box whipped up his horses and the van moved out of the yard at a smart trot
at this moment there was a tremendous uproar
at this sight the animals courage returned to them
at this snowball sprang to his feet and shouting down the sheep who had begun bleating again broke into a passionate appeal in favour of the windmill
at this some of the other animals murmured but it was no use
at this stage
at this there was a terrible baying sound outside and nine enormous dogs wearing brassstudded collars came bounding into the barn

because every time the ruling class will present it as a new set of “disturbances” or another act of violence or another example of unrest or some new agitators
because folksong and music are arts of performance you should take special care in recording them
because if we all work together may be we can restore belief in danfour

because part of any program for change is understanding
because past defeats are important because they bear lessons for us today and for the future
because people will not all have the same ideas on what to do and what not to do for the simple reason that the workers’ movement the trade union movement and the political movement are made up of many different organizations and people with many different ideas the ideas of one organization are not the same as those of another
because the connections between these economic and social these political and cultural issues suddenly become apparent to us
because the government that prepared this budget came out of the social democratic movement supposedly
because the more militant sectors in petrograd wanted to go and take power and the peasantry was not prepared other sections were not interested and the danger emerged that the more militant sections would be able to be mowed down in isolation from the other sections

because their business was growing they didnt have time for him a maid used to take care of him

boxer and clover always carried between them a green banner marked with the hoof and the horn and the caption long live comrade napoleon
boxer and clover pulled the wagon which served as a hearse and napoleon himself walked at the head of the procession
boxer could learn a b c d
boxer cried clover in a terrible voice boxer get out get out quickly
boxer lifted his hoof and the dog slunk away bruised and howling
boxer looked at napoleon to know whether he should crush the dog to death or let it go
boxer passed it off as usual with napoleon is always right but clover who thought she remembered a definite ruling against beds went to the end of the barn and tried to puzzle out the seven commandments which were inscribed there
boxer professed not to be sorry for what had happened
boxer put out his nose to sniff at the banknotes and the flimsy white things stirred and rustled in his breath
boxer refused to take even a day off work and made it a point of honour not to let it be seen that he was in pain
boxer saw them coming and put out his great hoof caught a dog in midair and pinned him to the ground
boxer she cried how are you
boxer was an enormous beast nearly eighteen hands high and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together
boxer was forgotten except by the few who had known him
boxer was never seen again
boxer was the admiration of everybody
boxer who had now had time to think things over voiced the general feeling
boxer would even come out at nights and work for an hour or two on his own by the light of the harvest moon
boxers side and without speaking kept the flies off him with his long tail
boxers split hoof was a long time in healing

but
but
but a bomb that’s not a natual disaster
but a few days later muriel reading over the seven commandments to herself noticed that there was yet another of them which the animals had remembered wrong
but a moment later his face disappeared from the window and there was the sound of a tremendous drumming of hoofs inside the van
but all grew again
but all such doubts were now dispelled
but all the studies only go to prove that this was a myth
but all this happened so that what the prophets wrote would come true
but although the mauritian economy might be insignificant to the global economic system the people who live in mauritius are important the men women and children living here are important
but an artist’s life is not easy and the life of a gay artist is even harder
but as early as 1995 with the setting up of the wto and all its new trade rules it had become clear that the subsidies that the beetproducers of europe as well as the acp africa caribbean and pacific countries got would be bound to become illegal
but as the animals outside gazed at the scene it seemed to them that some strange thing was happening
but as you fight for these demands and you get the kind of resistance we have just mentioned from the government and the capitalists and particularly from the procapitalist press you have to as part of your program have the capacity to justify it in the face of criticism and resistance against it and to convince more and more people during the course of the confrontations that these demands are what in reality represent the solution to our problems
but at different moments in history at different times and in different places different sections of the working class different strata within the middle classes or within the peasantry these different strata and sections constitute almost what are advanced or leading sectors within a struggle for change
but at this moment the four pigeons who had been sent out on the day before returned one of them bearing a scrap of paper from pilkington
but at this moment the three cows who had seemed uneasy for some time past set up a loud lowing
but before doing so there were a few words that he felt it incumbent upon him to say
but before looking into agricultural diversification in more detail let us look at what kind of institutional “backing” it is that has kept everyone believing that sugar is the best thing when it is only and maybe that too is not true good for the “sugar oligarchy” as a class
but benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly silence he read alfred simmonds horse slaughterer and glue boiler willingdon
but benjamin was watching the movements of the men intently
but boxer would not listen
but by and large the animals enjoyed these celebrations
but dario
but disappearance of a custom or a belief does not mark it as folklore
but doctors were not given permission to use force or restrain the woman
but dont act like them
but don’t do the same thing with my sheep as you did with my chickens
but don’t you believe that they were drinking pond water
but doubtless it had been worse in the days of jones
but elizabeth said no his name is john
but even though he scratched his head he couldn’t remember the name colophane so he told the king “cut down the almond trees”
but everyone worked according to his capacity
but everything will take place when it is supposed to
but for the first time it occurred to him that he was eleven years old and that perhaps his great muscles were not quite what they had once been
but from the beginning god did not intend it to be that way
but from the view of the capitalist system as a whole it is not “a bad thing” or an “alien phenomenon” so to speak
but he had to try everything to save his life
but he hasn’t got a boat
but he maintained that it could all be done in a year
but he only makes the rain fall below the trees
but he refused
but he stayed until he had sent the crowds away
but he was wounded said boxer we all saw him running with blood
but he will make sure that justice is done
but her two sons fled and it was their bad luck that they ran into the wolf’s house to hide
but he’s got two big wings
but his bottom was stuck to the pitch
but his faith in jesus wasn’t diminished
but how to tell my sunil
but however difficult you have to work with the trade union organizations work at convincing them that your program is in the interests of workers’ demands because you need support from the trade unions and you often have to work with the leaders they happen to have
but however it is not acceptable for people having land to refuse to produce food and that people who wants to produce food do not have land
but i am an old man and the king’s daughter is so young and beautiful
but i can promise you this
but i do not think you will be tasting me this time
but i have warned you beforehand
but i think just as an illustration of how there are attempts to preserve this block and for us as a left party we need to understand and to analyze these attempts
but i will come to the dream later
but if a country like the usa india china or the european union were to disappear the world economy would find itself drastically altered
but if that caretaker lets someone muddy up the water in my pond i will cut his throat
but if the home isnt deserving take back your blessing of peace
but if there is time you can complete what needs to be done
but if there were hardships to be borne they were partly offset by the fact that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had before
but if today you go and say to the working class in mauritius “we are in crisis lets go and seize power” workers will think you are crazy
but if you give it up for me you will find it
but if you give up your life for me you will find it
but if you intend to sell folklore materials which you record the law requires you to sign a different kind of contract with the artist to make sure he or she receives the profits
but if you keep on being faithful right to the end you will be saved
but in another moment the van was through it and rapidly disappearing down the road
but in fact every day when your policies serve to insult childrens mother tongues it too is extreme mental harm being caused
but in front of everyone peter said that isnt so
but in mauritius to some extent the preferential market for sugar and textiles is precisely what has protected the masses of the people however the globalisation logic means that for one two or three years there can be some protection but not after that
but in other parts of the world there have been mass movements and the big international conferences in mexico in mumbai in india in porto alegre in brazil attended by 80000 to 100000 people from all sorts of different organisations have for years now been discussing the effects of capitalist globalisation
but in the morning a deep silence hung over the farmhouse
but is this simply part of the order of nature
but it appears to me that that wall looks different
but it does not mean that the knowledge and tradition that has been developed in this sector must be “eradicated” as the government intends to do
but it has for a long time now been very weak
but it is a form of “economic growth” that is an accountancy trick because it is based on speculation
but it is still the bosses that continue to take all decisions of importance for the entire people and our survival on the planet and they do it singlehanded they continue their monopoly on land control on capital and on decisions about how to deploy “labour” and what jobs to create or not
but it means a reduction that is at the direct expense of state revenue
but it reminded me of something that i had long forgotten
but it was a slow laborious process
but it was my mother herself who sent me here to ask to marry your daughter
but it was noticed that these two were never in agreement whatever suggestion either of them made the other could be counted on to oppose it
but it was some minutes before they could fully take it in
but its going to be terrible for the one who betrays me
but i’ll go anyway
but i’m talking about the difficulties that the revolutionary parties have in coming to terms with the need for a shift in their own psychology
but jesus called the disciples together and said
but jesus came over and touched them
but jesus did not answer
but jesus replied
but jesus replied why are you so afraid
but jesus told him put your sword away
but john kept objecting and said i ought to be baptized by you
but john said to them
but just at this moment napoleon stood up and casting a peculiar sidelong look at snowball uttered a highpitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before
but may share similar warning signs
but more to the good he or she can then become a high level bilingual or trilingual calp provided that he has reached a high level in his or her mother tongue
but my own situation was much more serious
but napoleon was too clever for him
but neither the bosses nor the political parties that successively came to power anticipated the problem as it could have and should have been anticipated
but no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end
but no warm mash appeared and on the following sunday it was announced that from now onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs
but none of you should be called a teacher
but noone wanted to buy them
but not more comfortable than we need i can tell you comrades with all the brainwork we have to do nowadays
but not one drop of water flowed into his pond
but nothing is cut and dried—life is full of ups and downs
but notice that some rights have not been lost at all for example the bosses still have the right to exploit people the right to make profits these are still acquired rights for them
but now catastrophic decreases may suddenly be upon us
but on the third day he will rise from death
but on the way his hoof hit the stump of a tamanicoque tree
but once again it was just that the working class was being made to bear the brunt of the crisis because jobs themselves not just individual workers’ salaries were being lost ever
but once again the men with their sticks and their hobnailed boots were too strong for them and suddenly at a squeal from snowball which was the signal for retreat
but once i told him that it’s not charity that would save us but economic power he became uneasy
but one day exhausted and sickened she left him
but one night on her way to see me a group of hoodlums attacked her even though they knew she was part of our group
but one thing was wrong his pond was completely dry
but people worked against it
but proverbs do vary in the meanings people attach to them
but she always made such excellent excuses and purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions
but she could not look clover in the face and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the field
but she was infected with the aids virus
but sme’s producing what
but some animals are more equal than others
but somehow neither the words nor the tune ever seemed to the animals to come up to beasts of england
but sometimes at christmas time no money is left to buy presents
but still it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled
but still neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour and there were very many of them and their appetites were always good
but studies like these will help us focus
but suddenly the dogs sitting round napoleon let out deep menacing growls
but swimming against the current is no easy task
but technology and science does not necessarily mean better working conditions it depends on who has the economic power and on what social class has control over the economy
but ten years ago the financiers the big farmers the industrialists and the professionals succeeded in forming a municipal administration which made it easy for a small group to expand people who controlled everything land water the plantations industry banks the media
but that is not what it is putting into practice in the budget
but that is the task before us
but the angel said dont be afraid
but the angel told him
but the autonomous administration would rapidly denounce all their backwardlooking impulses
but the capitalists who controlled most of the land and who were attached to sugar production did not agree and forced the state to abandon this plan very quickly
but the change was always in just one direction every man for himself
but the children do not feel like singing
but the clay pot gave way to the iron pot
but the colonial state used repression systematically against workers
but the cook was not there
but the counterpressure of the unions is also rather weak because unions find it notoriously difficult to think or act outside of the bosses’ logic
but the end of the preferential market is something that has been predictable for ages and especially since the creation of the world trade organisation in 19941995
but the fact that it is of exceptional duration means that incurable structural contradictions have revealed themselves reached their maturity
but the gate to life is very narrow
but the government has consistently attacked small scale agricultural production especially compared with sugar production
but the government has never respected its commitment
but the groom replied i dont even know you
but the guest had no excuse
but the guests did not pay any attention
but the important thing about the problem is that the planters through the labour party had to reach a new historical accommodation with the sugar oligarchy so that these classes could continue to act together under a new balance of forces within the ruling block
but the king was sad
but the luxuries of which snowball had once taught the animals to dream the stalls with electric light and hot and cold water and the threeday week were no longer talked about
but the men did not go unscathed either
but the most terrifying spectacle of all was boxer rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great ironshod hoofs like a stallion
but the ones who pleased god will have eternal life
but the pigs seemed comfortable enough and in fact were putting on weight if anything
but the pigs were so clever that they could think of a way round every difficulty
but the poor unfortunate had to make another try
but the population of danfour who were having difficulty just making ends meet werent interested in highflying rhetoric
but the rebellion is now completed
but the son of man goes around eating and drinking and you say that man eats and drinks too much he is even a friend of tax collectors and sinners
but the string comes out with no fish on it
but the sugar industry went on surviving because of the protectionism that europe offered through the sugar protocol
but the superior quality of napoleons mind said squealer was shown in the fact that he trusted nobody not even frederick
but the tenants grabbed those servants
but the tenants treated them in the same way
but the van was already gathering speed and drawing away from them
but their efforts were rewarded for the harvest was an even bigger success than they had hoped
but then he also says that what will save mauritius is 1000 2000 or 3000 tiny little small enterprises
but then how could the words of the scriptures come true which say that this must happen
but there has been a great development and during the year 2002 education in the preschool and the first two classes in school were made in 470 languages
but there is another aspect that is not often mentioned
but there is another matter that must be attended to first
but there is another problem which is very systemically rooted in the very nature of the working class  which is that the working class’s different sectors and different strata experience capitalism and the crisis differently
but there is one condition
but there is worse than that
but there was no alternative
but there was no grass
but there were also rumours of something more serious
but there were only bitter blackwood leaves in her mouth
but these evil people did believe
but they could not find any even though many did come and tell lies
but they destroy all the seed beds
but they did not sleep together before her baby was born
but they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short
but they have destroyed the windmill
but they saw now that the commandment had not been violated
but they should make their choices on the basis of a knowledge of tradition not on ignorance
but they were not the only ones with a vested interest
but they woke at dawn as usual and suddenly remembering the glorious thing that had happened they all raced out into the pasture together
but this is a good opportunity
but this is just the beginning of troubles
but this is not the main explanation for how year in year out they govern in ways that are against your interests and yet they stay in control of government
but this time grandmother spider shouted at him angrily
but those in the middle class the ones who had been fed by the silver spoons of providence now had to find a lifeline fast
but those who take decisions persisted in doing absolutely nothing to prevent it avoid it or transcend it
but to succeed we had to be sure we didn’t forget what the source of our problems was
but today i have noone to hold my hand as i take my last steps noone besides you
but today there is an international movement fighting this theft of the multinationals over agriculture  a movement regrouping peasants planters cattle breeders progressive unions left political parties ecologists women and youth organizations
but we dont want to cause trouble
but we were wrong comrades
but what is even truer is that they are always looking at profit in the short term only
but what is interesting in the nature of a transitional program is that as you mobilize around it the unions throw up new leaders
but what is this special route
but what they succeed in making you think is that because you have the right to vote once every 5 years or in a byelection from time to time that this is what is called “democracy”
but what took him by surprise was that i was going to play along
but whatever their reason for doing this the result is that the working class and the poor will be getting lower real wages than they used to get for the same amount of work
but when he comes to making proposals for possible solutions these are diametrically opposed to lalit’s
but when jesus tasted what it was he refused to drink it
but when prof derek bickerton was here at a seminar with highup officers all of them agree with him vocally that the only possible medium of instruction is the mother tongue
but when she started her second year her father had a stroke and his business suffered
but when the animals saw the green flag flying and heard the gun firing again  seven times it was fired in all  and heard the speech that napoleon made congratulating them on their conduct it did seem to them after all that they had won a great victory
but when they saw the mans son they said some day he will own the vineyard
but when they were given the same they began complaining to the owner of the vineyard
but when you start “targeting” making people pay this too is a form of privatization in that people will have to move into private institutions because the state is no longer providing the service as a right
but who is the employer that will take on a 61yearold bricklayer on his worksite to lay bricks and plaster ceilings
but without the help of a philanthropist we would not have been able to make ends meet and those who were hivpositive would not get any treatment
but you dont understand what is happening now
but you have turned it into a place where robbers hide
but you must always act like your father in heaven
but you paid them the same that you did us
but you should also listen for any sort of poetry not connected with music children’s rhymes poems on the death of a local person
but you will notice that he is someone who can make proposals at the level of his neighbourhood at his worksite or in the union
but you wouldnt let me
but “preferential trade” is an abstract concept

by force
by halibut fishing standards it was a submarine
by late summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated and then the building began under the superintendence of the pigs
by mouth
by revealing people’s ideas of good and bad and identifying the parts of their life about which they have bad feelings folklore gives us the finest information about what is important to them
by seeming to be friendly with pilkington he had forced frederick to raise his price by twelve pounds
by the day
by the evening however napoleon appeared to be somewhat better and the following morning squealer was able to tell them that he was well on the way to recovery
by the evening of that day napoleon was back at work and on the next day it was learned that he had instructed whymper to purchase in willingdon some booklets on brewing and distilling
by the late summer the news of what had happened on animal farm had spread across half the county
by the time he had finished speaking there was no doubt as to which way the vote would go
by the way
by their parts being arranged by a magic charm in words

clover asked benjamin to read her the sixth commandment and when benjamin as usual said that he refused to meddle in such matters she fetched muriel
clover dropped to her knees at his side
clover learnt the whole alphabet but could not put words together
clover made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep
clover treated the hoof with poultices of herbs which she prepared by chewing them and both she and benjamin urged boxer to work less hard
clover warned him sometimes to be careful not to overstrain himself but boxer would never listen to her
clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal
clover was an old stout mare now stiff in the joints and with a tendency to rheumy eyes
clovers old dim eyes flitted from one face to another

especially as the mmm had extraordinarily wide support in the country
especially in the light of the fact that bourgeois ideologues like to defend their project by saying for example in south africa “don’t be ridiculous the textile sector has been under assault for the past 10 years”

even if we didn’t call it a crisis the structural problems in the mauritian capitalist system and the problems of the mauritian economy in its relationship with the world economy – which used to give the appearance of being protected from the consequences of changes in the world economy – make it abundantly clear for everyone to see that the mauritian economy and even the whole of mauritian society are already undergoing massive upheavals
even if you speak against the son of man you can be forgiven
even in a relatively straightforward event like a pilgrimage hundreds of persons carry out many different kinds of activities

even the wind and the waves obey him
even though she never went to school she believed in education
even though there have been protests the law was passed in the national assembly in march 2004
even very small or seemingly unimportant words or behavior need to be recorded
even when i was young i could not have read what was written there
even when it was resolved a thing no one could object to in itself to set aside the small paddock behind the orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work there was a stormy debate over the correct retiring age for each class of animal
even when there are tourist hotels and free zone factories in the countryside in mauritius it is still until today life around the sugar mill and cane plantation that provides the social cohesion of village life

folklore and oral traditions should be recorded and preserved in mauritius for their own worth and for their use in understanding and advancing the nation
folklore communication at a fancy fair
folklore events happen again and again
folklore in mauritiusin this view includes a great deal more than the sega and is performed by many more people than poor labourers
folklore is always perfonned according to certain rules which people know and which you should find out
folklore meant something inherited from earlier times which is now threatened with disappearance one could call sanathan hinduism or chinese buddhism folklore
folklore of experience
folklore thus take in local and national history
folkloric
folklorists call them “personal experience stories and legends
folktale oral tradition and folksong are found among the richest people as among the poorest
folktales
folktales about persons
folktales are considered as fiction
folktales do not come to us from a more primitive stage of culture they are not survivals of a crude past
folktales do not take place in real time
folktales exist in variant forms forms which differ from one another
folktales have value for all people as your collecting experience will quickly tell you
folktales should be recorded in the exact words of the teller

for
for 200 years the mauritian private sector bosses have been in charge of the economy
for a horse it was said the pension would be five pounds of corn a day and in winter fifteen pounds of hay with a carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays
for a long time
for a long time he has been given these long interviews especially in mauritius times and he clearly has a vision a political project an economic projection of what he would like mauritius to become
for a long time the little mouse shivers with fear
for a long time there had been rumours  circulated he had reason to think by some malignant enemy that there was something subversive and even revolutionary in the outlook of himself and his colleagues
for a minute or two they stood gazing at the tatted wall with its white lettering
for a moment there was great alarm
for all mauritian groups cultural resilience and adaptation might indeed be regarded as the most outstanding as well as the most persistent form of resistant to the legal spatial economic psychological and health controls with which they have been surrounded
for all such persons get answers to how did this person become known and ‘“what was the story of hisher life“
for capitalism crisis is also a way in which the system selfregulates
for centuries women in mauritius have worked unbelievably hard to keep house feed their families and grow food
for days and days sinn sinn stays inside the parcel
for days at a time the animals had nothing to eat but chaff and mangels
for decades the sugar industry has benefited from an array of supports set up from before independence and on until the present
for example free education free health services subsidizing certain costs of education free transport for pensioners and students
for example government has organized prepayments to small planters for their cane
for example in european countries where a government born out of the workers’ movement like the british labour party or the french socialist party came to power in the normal course of history they have created institutions within the state within the capitalist system that to some extent protected workers and they have conducted their politics so as to give a certain degree of protection to working people
for example irs integrated resort schemes will seem more profitable to landowners than the development of the food sector even though the latter would enhance the economy for everybody
for example it is essential to assess whether this production can be maintained over time
for example squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things called files reports minutes and memoranda these were large sheets of paper which had to be closely covered with writing and as soon as they were so covered they were burnt in the furnace
for example tax should be removed on all machinery used in this sector
for example they can increase or decrease the proportion of workers on the farm or in the related industries
for example they make you believe that “private property” is a good and normal thing
for example today the working class movement is on the defensive right now public sector workers are mobilizing rising up in protest making demands
for example we know that the state has started to act
for example you might hear someone say the snail dances the monkey laughs
for example “integrated farming” in china where profitmaking is not the main motive but other questions are taken into consideration
for five days the hens held out then they capitulated and went back to their nesting boxes
for four years i went to work and i also studied and when i was close to my twentyfifth birthday i passed my exams
for health for university education and for pensions the state is intending to phase out the services as a right
for her brother who had taken over her father’s business she was nothing but a huge burden
for him these two work together sometimes one takes priority over the other sometimes it’s the other way around
for how long
for how long despite its history as a working class movement will we be able to continue regarding the labour party as a social democrat political organization one that still has links with the working class movement
for instance a folktale about a girl who refuses all suitors and then marries a wolfman points to what can happen to a girl who marries without her parents’ approval
for instance being drunk may be called roze nisa also used to mean high on drugs
for instance in another story involving animals a man learns secrets from the talk of animals
for instance is there some part of the space where some persons should not go
for instance some people say that moka isnamed  for mecca the holy city of islam while others connect it to mocha coffee
for instance the fancy fair of st anne of chamarel some people say is famous for much public drunkenness
for instance you might like to look at mauritian cookery
for khadija auntie’s family it was a source of great shame if a girl was left high and dry
for life
for myself i do not grumble for i am one of the lucky ones
for once benjamin consented to break his rule and he read out to her what was written on the wall
for one week we’ll have the police patrol the hillsides instead
for optimum results the first language should be continued as the language of instruction through primary school
for questions of strategy it is quite crucial that we begin to look a little more closely at how is the hegemonic block organized
for quite some time he had been encouraging my gradfather to open a retail shop
for quite some time he stood there quietly
for sale
for seven days now he had not been able to bathe
for small planters this scale of price fall will be a veritable catastrophe
for some time many outsiders had been coming to buy land on which to build second homes
for some time nobody spoke
for some weeks nothing was known of her whereabouts then the pigeons reported that they had seen her on the other side of willingdon
for the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune
for the first time in my life i was financially independent
for the first time since the expulsion of jones there was something resembling a rebellion
for the moment even napoleon seemed at a loss
for the next two days boxer remained in his stall
for the next year i was bullied and mocked for two things that my french was poor and that i had tata dan lenz
for the time being the young pigs were given their instruction by napoleon himself in the farmhouse kitchen
for these reasons it is often only when people are actively struggling on the basis of demands that they themselves find sensible and reasonable as well as in their own interests demands that they come to actually see clearly and to understand in practice and agree to stand up for when confronted with the inevitable resistance they meet only then do they find themselves in a position to oppose this bourgeois ideology
for we have reason to think that some of snowballs secret agents are lurking among us at this moment
for we know now it is all written down in the secret documents that we have found  that in reality he was trying to lure us to our doom
for what market are they supposed to produce
for whole days at a time he would lounge in his windsor chair in the kitchen reading the newspapers drinking and occasionally feeding moses on crusts of bread soaked in beer

four days later in the late afternoon napoleon ordered all the animals to assemble in the yard
four dogs guarded his bed at night one at each corner and a young pig named pinkeye was given the task of tasting all his food before he ate it lest it should be poisoned

frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something called a cheque
frederick it was said intended to bring against them twenty men all armed with guns and he had already bribed the magistrates and police so that if he could once get hold of the titledeeds of animal farm they would ask no questions
frederick shouted to his men to get out while the going was good and the next moment the cowardly enemy was running for dear life

given her situation finding a man was tough  lawyers and doctors didnt think she was rich enough civil servants were worried about an educated woman who had tasted life at university
given that 99 of the research on gmos is done by private multinational companies which aim at profitmaximization for their stake holders
given that mauritius is constituted of islands and archipelagoes we have the possibility of an agriculture which is really “gmofree” thus giving it a great commercial value
given that multinationals aim at a monopoly on the production of seeds they made it illegal to reuse their seeds with wto agreement or impossible to use it more than once due to the fact that it is a ‘terminator’ seed and it cannot reproduce itself
given that multinationals which are engaged in the production of seeds mosanto etc produce 99 of gmo seeds so as to tolerate their herbicides poisons such as roundup or to transform the tree itself into insecticides more poison that is they are increasing the dangerous products dosage in food
given that nature itself beyond agriculture is being affected by the gmos which are not being controlled
given that pollinating insects can be affected by it this results in great risk of contamination for agricultural reproduction of other foods
given that studies done in the united states of america have shown that american food production has been contaminated in a more vast way than scientists had predicted in fact through wind and pollination insects
given that the change brought about by gmos can be irreversible because it deals with genetic materials
given that the consequences on human beings and human health on animals are totally unpredictable and given that recent studies in united kingdom show an increase in “allergic” reactions due to gmos
given that the first gmos that have been manipulated by the msiri has been done specifically to make sugar cane resistant to roundup herbicide
given that the rule of law renders the state responsible and liable for the actions omissions misdemeanours and crimes of its police agents and that in addition they must be brought to justice for their breaches of the criminal law or infringements of human rights as all other citizens
given that the wto allows private companies to take out “patents on life” this means that food security of the worlds people is critically under threat
given that there is a risk of popular boycott of our sugar in europe if it is not “gmofree”
given that there is sufficient food production for everybody on planet earth and that the problem of hunger and famine is instead due to the politics of distribution

government after government has perpetuated this state of affairs
government has in 2007 set up the “tripartite” national pay council mentioned earlier
government is continuing to encourage english and french to be killer languages in mauritius instead of additional advantages
government is doing no more than taking measures that ultimately only serve to aggravate these two major problems
government is forcibly transferring children from their own group to another linguistic group through education of children being dispensed in a dominant and foreign language english and french at the expense of their mother tongues bhojpuri and kreol as medium of education
government is forcing children to acquire additional languages in a way that is called subtractive and it is this subtracting of the natural language of our people that causes the government to be guilty of linguistic genocide
government is prohibiting the use of bhojpuri and kreol by failing to make it an official language while imposing other official languages in school
government is responsible for this linguistic genocide by refusing to prepare and publish books for school in bhojpuri and kreol

however benjamin and clover could only be with boxer after working hoursand it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away
however in a period of crisis a political party like lalit has other responsibilities

i think i will talk briefly about the second problem that is the problem of synchronization in the development of the class struggle
i think in south africa from our own experience south african society in general experienced a very profound historical crisis which first broke out visibly at the end of the 1960’s
i think in the first instance and this is undertaken in the lalit paper we speak of one having to provide a coherent analysis of the economic problems of the country of the socioeconomic structure of the sources of the crisis
i think just to tie up this section many of us are aware that as this crisis begins to make itself felt there are already underfoot within the bourgeoisie attempts to preserve the hegemonic block under new conditions
i think on the grounds of this unfolding of the organic crisis two key things can or need to be done
i think that in people’s minds we were just two good friends
i think that the party in particular and i want to talk more about this at the end of the talk has to prepare itself psychologically
i think there is an important thing that may be we don’t talk about enough and which i thought was important to throw in at the beginning so that maybe we can come back to it later

i would like to underline that when we proposed an alternative political economy during the course of the election campaign we made it clear that both the social alliance and the msmmmm alliance whichever would form the next government after the elections would go ahead and implement ultraliberal policies – no matter what they said in the campaign
i would not have believed that such things could happen on our farm

in danfour
in danfour me and others like me formed a solidarity network we had two reasons  first to prevent loneliness from weighing too heavily on us second to become interdependent since so many of our problems were connected
in danfour there was a different kind of violence
in danfour too there were problems but they werent as serious
in danfour we can find a sucker who’ll be able to do this for a little quick cash

in fact
in fact he did not tell them anything without using stories
in fact he has already come
in fact i rather mistrusted politicians but i had a notion that it was possible to have the two work together
in fact if we look at the last four elections we find that this is exactly what happened if we can’t go beyond replacing one politician by another and if people think we’re crazy when we say “let’s take power ourselves” the question is “what is to be done”
in fact informants are more important than collectors and you will need to let people know that you think so

in fact the answer to this question may be of primary importance for our future strategies
in fact the biggest problem in crises has tended to be the political parties of the working class
in fact the bourgeoisie and past governments by refusing to anticipate what would quite obviously happen in the textile and sugar industries and what is now in fact happening are responsible for this crisis
in fact the crisis is affecting the population already and doing so violently
in fact the economic policy applied by different governments has perpetuated this situation
in fact the government and capitalists control the economy and they control society

in his speeches squealer would talk with the tears rolling down his cheeks of napoleons wisdom the goodness of his heart and the deep love he bore to all animals everywhere even and especially the unhappy animals who still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms
in historical terms what happened was that because the “selfreliance” project was not viable and it took centrestage in debates the debates on agricultural diversification came a cropper

in israel in the 1950’s the kibbutz cooperatives developed integrated farming with an adapted irrigation system in the desert of negev

in lalit we already have many international contacts
in lalit we have a different philosophy we believe it is necessary to develop diversified agriculture and agroindustry not just for “self reliance” but as part of an export strategy as well
in lalit’s campaign we are linking twoorthree important issues into the debate
in line with

in lpt as far as we are concerned we are in favour of all our children becoming high level multilingual
in l’express for 7 july 1980 for example there appeared an interview with a man who dreamed a girl was telling him how to find buried treasure
in malawi the children were taught in various local languages which were mostly there mother tongues
in many countries the working class movement has succeeded in imposing on the capitalist economy that when a worker can’t get work when a young person is looking for a job he or she has to get an unemployment benefit in order to live
in many countries these effects have already been felt
in mauritius most children even those who get as far as university show signs of having severe problems in cognition that is to say in calp
in mauritius people are keenly aware of the speed of cultural and economic change in their own lives and experience
in mauritius some people already have a profound knowledge about farming including cowkeeping other animal rearing and planting all sorts of food crops
in mauritius there have been experiments on cattle rearing cultivation and fish breeding
in mauritius they are not disappearing but they are changing partly under the influence of the way they are actually practiced
in mauritius too
in mauritius we have seen these types of organizations group together to protest against and to warn the mmmmsm government against the utilization of gmo seeds and products at the time that the government brought in its own gmos
in mauritius work in the agricultural sector has always been associated with hard and heavy labour due to the semifeudal working conditions which characterize labourers work on the sugar estates
in modern mauritian life everyone is a member of more than one folk group

in one and the same speech he tells us two different things when looking at the sugar industry he says that the 11 existing sugar mills in the country that each produces 50000 tons of sugar can’t survive because they aren’t big enough he says in order to survive they have to produce at least 100000 tons in just four huge huge production units
in order for us to get ahead we put the other shops out of business
in order for us to have these experiences available to our children and their children traditions must be preserved
in order to cope with the disappearing preferential markets what does the sithanen budget propose how does he intend to relaunch the economy even in his own terms how does he intend to attract investments how does he intend to improve growth rates and more importantly how does he intend to create jobs
in other parts of the world the consequences have already been felt for the past three four five six years
in other words
in other words a program cannot be an appeal to society in general
in other words if i borrow from the way gramsci described it “is this crisis conjunctural”
in other words it’s got a much deeper historical character and it goes far beyond the normal modes of selfreproduction of capitalism as a social system
in other words the consciousness of the dominated classes discerns between a major crisis and this kind of crisis which is cyclical leads to a minor realignment within the system leads to what the bourgeois economists call “frictional unemployment” when workers move from one sector and they are absorbed into another
in other words they plan their own production very carefully within their enterprise through the most sophisticated planning systems
in other words those classes in the battle are so exhausted that the whole thing disintegrates
in other words to provide a criticism of political economy political economy is not about just production it is about the class relations that underpin it
in other words we must have an analysis of the totality of social classes and of where our program is positioned relative to these social classes
in other words what will be the basis of the political hegemony of the sugar bosses in this country
in other words when these problems happen within society we see a focus of the criticism on the political leadership on the personalities within the political leadership you know in south africa we would see this is a case of “mismanagement” of the economy
in other words you throw your shoes into the market and then you wait and see what happens
in our campaign against ‘fermtir sovaz’ of sugar mills which had only just begun we were even then envisaging forcing the oligarchs to convert all mills closing down into agroindustries of modern types canning freezedrying freezing transformation into juices soups etc
in our campaign we must also denounce the incapacity of the political regime to protect employment and workers’ standard of living and expose how this is as a result of their having adopted the bosses’ agenda
in our campaign we must denounce this
in our electoral campaign we also warned against austerity measures and the way they would be imposed by the state through repression
in our house we called him kavi uncle
in our modern times it will be agriculture based on scientific methods of cultivation and breeding built on existing traditional knowledge and for the amelioration of working conditions and production
in our village and in the neighboring areas too the winds of change had started to blow
in our village we always played along in order to avoid any conflicts
in our village you would often hear “chalata diredire”
in our “democratic system” the one we have until now things are run in the interests of a minority
in particular i will explain what flows from the lalit demands what kind of ideology
in particular you are now legally even more directly liable for any harm that children come to once education has become compulsory and after your recent hardhitting campaign to force parents to send their children to school

in spite of its limited resources our shelter papernoula was able to help out about a dozen families
in spite of the lack of interest in social action among the majority of people every time there was a tragedy there spontaneously arose a small solidarity movement and a little light appeared where noone expected it
in spite of the shock that snowball’s expulsion had given them the animals were dismayed by this announcement
in spite of widespread death and destruction it was still possible for people to have a relatively manageable life
in such places as india latin america and africa they have started to witness its direct effects
in sugarcandy mountain it was sunday seven days a week clover was in season all the year round and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges
in sum we need an economic policy which will encourage the development of scientific agriculture based on what is already used in mauritius which will produce not only for the local market but also for exportation
in the 1980’s the export levy on sugar was further reduced until it disappeared altogether
in the 90’s the multinationals financed laboratories to invent methods of genetically modifying living organisms

in the dust with his great hoof and then would stand staring at the letters with his ears back sometimes shaking his forelock trying with all his might to remember what came next and never succeeding
in the ecstasy of that thought they gambolled round and round they hurled themselves into the air in great leaps of excitement they rolled in the dew they cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass they kicked up clods of the black earth and snuffed its rich scent
in the end however she was found hiding in her stall with her head buried among the hay in the manger
in the end they finished the harvest in two days less time than it had usually taken jones and his men
in the evening he returned to the farmhouse himself but as it was warm weather told the sheep to stay where they were
in the evening squealer called them together and with an alarmed expression on his face told them that he had some serious news to report
in the evenings he would admit privately to clover that the hoof troubled him a great deal
in the evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him while benjamin kept the flies off him

in the feudal period the lords controlled the peasants by proclaiming themselves as the owners of the land nowadays their descendants are proclaiming themselves to be the owners of plant seeds and as if this was not enough they are setting about destroying our planet earth
in the fisheries lalit proposes that the government compels the private sector into investing in fishing on an industrial level or the government might itself invest in this sector
in the forefront
in the general rejoicings the unfortunate affair of the banknotes was forgotten
in the historical problematic i mentioned the july days it became quite a major issue because comrades realized that the future of the revolution was at risk
in the history os mauritius there have been numerous attempts to put the question of agricultural diversification on the agenda
in the late summer yet another of snowballs machinations was laid bare
in the legend mauritius is said to be spiritually connected to india

in the long pasture not far from the farm buildings there was a small knoll which was the highest point on the farm
in the long run
in the long run even capitalist production will lose out in lots of ways the soil will get impoverished the environment spoilt underground water supplies will decrease drastically the capitalist negligence will destroy insects and animals which contribute to the perpetuation of life on our planet
in the long run he promises in the budget that however much you earn as an individual or a company you will only be taxed at the rate of 15

in the middle of the summer moses the raven suddenly reappeared on the farm after an absence of several years
in the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to hear that three hens had come forward and confessed that inspired by snowball they had entered into a plot to murder napoleon
in the midwest of the united states the soil has been so impoverished through uncontrolled cultivation and petrol exploitation that today there is desertification over there

in the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed equally terrible but it seemed to all of them that it was far worse now that it was happening among themselves
in the open air
in the past 10 years this monopoly situation has if anything deteriorated
in the past because mauritian wage levels were not the lowest we saw the bosses “delocalising” and moving out to mozambique madagascar tanzania and elsewhere where labour is cheaper
in the past due to the fact that cultivation and cattle rearing had been done only on a commercial basis for profit there has not been enough thinking on how to integrate different types of plant cultivation and also cattle rearing within the same project
in the past labour relied on some conscious working class support but right now it attacks the working class and its unions which are reeling under the attack
in the past people did not know that
in the past the labour party in 1953 labour has always in the last analysis protected the state bourgeoisie and those specific capitalists in the historic bourgeoisie who “cooperate” in its political plan to broaden the social base of the bourgeoisie
in the pond your majesty
in the present context it is important that we put the question of the production of energy together with agriculture and agroindustry
in the present context people will easily understand the transitional nature of our proposals
in the process of being discussed you will find the program will be enriched broadened it may also narrow down but what is important is that you as a party member as you talk to other people you all begin to share a common understanding and to develop a common understanding
in the restaurant next to the reception desk

in the same time lpt one among the pioneer organisations which is still promoting mother tongue based education lpt is dedicating this award to all participants animators members supporting members and all associations and individuals in the republic of mauritius and abroad who are still struggling for the recognition of mother tongue
in the same way that the former government invented this concept of irs as rich ghettos special touristy places where very rich people will buy bungalows for rs 15 millions with a golf course marinas with boats on beaches for their personal use
in the short term
in the sugar industry there are still a lot of jobs though there too jobs have decreased
in the teeth of every difficulty in spite of inexperience of primitive implements of bad luck and of snowballs treachery the work had been finished punctually to the very day
in the tradition of the working class movement the demands like those being put forward by lalit are known as “transitional demands”

in their attempt to shore up their own positions they begin to organize outside
in their spare moments the animals would walk round and round the halffinished mill admiring the strength and perpendicularity of its walls and marvelling that they should ever have been able to build anything so imposing
in these days napoleon rarely appeared in public but spent all his time in the farmhouse which was guarded at each door by fiercelooking dogs
in this budget sithanen is taking measures that will bring mauritian wages down to these lower levels this is being done so as to reestablish competitiveness on the global market
in this case you are talking of the crisis in the sugar industry of the textile industry
in this ceremony the bridetobe is anointed and then segregated from other people
in this kind of openended investigation you will learn to base your questions on what a person has already said
in this period just before the beginning of the wwii leon trotsky with the help of his other comrades developed a program called a “transitional program” in french it is usually known as “programme transitoire” but in lalit we understand you use the term “program tranzisyonel” because transposition from french into kreol gives the idea that it is ephemeral

instead of building a cybercity on rocky land somewhere they spread concrete all over the finest land in the country at ebene
instead of developing agriculture and industry to assure food security and food for export they go ahead with a slaveminded plan to attract the millionaires of the planet to come and build big villas here thus reducing mauritian citizens to being virtual servants on a permanent basis
instead of developing the will to modernize and rationalize this traditional form of agriculture the mmmmsm governments economic policy relies on slogans like “biotechnology” which in the way they intend to use it will in fact bring about the destruction of this sector
instead of diversifying agriculture so as to assure food security and to increase the productivity of agricultural land the sugar companies went on planting cane and investing in textiles and tourism for the shortterm profits these offered them
instead of letting him put the goods on a bicyle and selling it throughout our village his wife gave him a motorbike
instead of paying for increasingly expensive fossil fuels the same money pays workers for the ongoing upkeep of the farm
instead of playing soccer or volleyball we both preferred to sit together under a tree
instead of thinking about what longterm future the sugar industry really had the ruling classes just went into textiles and tourism while gradually giving more and more tax concessions to the sugar bosses mainly reducing the sugar export levy
instead of trying to win over the heads of the camps and the clans they simply bought them off one by one
instead she did not know why they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind when fierce growling dogs roamed everywhere and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes

it allies ceb with a malaysian company
it already exists here even though it is on a small scale
it also became important and was unfortunately the source of many defeats in europe in the 1930’s where the working class was ordered when this group dominated the comintern to be on the offensive against the bourgeoisie and told that this is the last fight against the bourgeoisie and will be an all out fight
it also depends on what your strategy is what program you have and where it is leading you
it also questions whether this agricultural production takes into account our environment our ecology
it appears in baissacs book and the storyteller nelzir ventre perfumed it on a mabc television broadcast on 2 january 1983
it appears that in periods of organic crisis you have both periods of very slow development of the crisis and of swift movement
it became a state within a state
it becomes imperative for us to demonstrate that the organic relationships within the mauritian economy are of such a nature that the crisis of sugar and textiles is a crisis of the mauritian economy
it can be a story you have heard at home or while playing with other children or in school or anywhere else
it cannot be stopped
it carried on
it certainly was all mixed up in my head
it changes as old sectors close new sectors emerge
it changes with changes in the development of capitalism
it changes with the development of new sectors of production
it consisted of a brass medal they were really some old horsebrasses which had been found in the harnessroom to be worn on sundays and holidays
it contains analyses of how we understand the capitalist system and it involves communicating this understanding not only to the most advanced sections of the working class who understand a lot already and who have a highly developed political consciousness already but to the greatest number of workers and the greatest number of other people who suffer because of the capitalist system
it continues to move in a general southerly direction at about 05 kmh
it could be a helicopter
it couldn’t be repaired
it depends on your capacity to organize and on the strength of your organization and also on its independence from the capitalists
it depends you announced what unesco tells you is best
it did in a big way
it did not seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a wireless set were arranging to install a telephone and had taken out subscriptions to several newspapers
it did not seem strange when napoleon was seen strolling in the farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth  no not even when the pigs took mr jones’s clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on napoleon himself appearing in a black coat ratcatcher breeches and leather leggings while his favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which mrs jones had been used to wear on sundays
it does matter what people say and think about it
it does not always exist nor is it preserved in exactly the same form as it has been in the past
it does not hurt much
it does not matter
it doesn’t just depend on whether you’ve got a good trade union negotiator a clever lawyer a good judge as to which concessions the capitalist will make to your demands
it doesn’t matter
it doesn’t matter
it doesn’t matter whether that’s true or not
it encourages indian investment in the land based oceanic industry and in the petroleum products trade creating space for indian oil to compete with the previous oligopoly
it ended by their remaining there for a whole week during which time the other animals saw nothing of them
it even cleanses the system of old or antiquated sectors propels the development of new sectors and technologies
it falls into a ball of seaweed in the middle of rocks
it felt good to have the warmth of the sun on their skin
it follows like day follows night
it found its expression most strongly in two major strike waves
it glides smoothly into the lagoon
it goes from one upsurge to a time of calm to another upsurge and another crisis as the different social classes are taking stock of their different solutions in the upturns and especially in times of calm
it goes without saying that once an organic crisis begins to unfold its form of existence is a series of conjunctural crises
it had become usual to give napoleon the credit for every successful achievement and every stroke of good fortune
it had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as mr jones was safely out of the way
it had been felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neighbourhood
it had been overlooked at the time when the house was occupied
it had come to be accepted that the pigs who were manifestly cleverer than the other animals should decide all questions of farm policy though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote
it had not been possible he said to bring back their lamented comrades remains for interment on the farm but he had ordered a large wreath to be made from the laurels in the farmhouse garden and sent down to be placed on boxers grave
it had spread with astonishing speed
it had to hear him yelled horribly
it happened that jessie and bluebell had both helped soon after the hay harvest giving birth between them to nine sturdy puppies
it happened that there was in the yard a pile of timber which had been stacked there ten years earlier when a beech spinney was cleared
it happens sometimes that these parts of the block can’t identify together anymore
it has all been proved by documents which he left behind him and which we have only just discovered
it has been created but only on paper
it has been painful since this morning
it has deep reserves in the whole international block that looks after it that is entrusted with its welfare
it has even gone into policing
it has gone deeply into muckcollection
it has set up the factory area system to share planters out amongst mills
it has some beautiful historic architecture and some good museums
it has taken over control of mauritius telecom which was a department of government
it has to provide for the poor the sick the elderly the handicapped it has to provide education and health to all people
it has two big horns
it hits the reef
it hurts a lot
it hurts here
it is
it is a folk idea a traditional notion that mauritians have about the nature of man of the world and of man’s life in the world” as defined in an important article by alan dundes1971 95
it is a good example to remind you that everyday life is where you find most folklore
it is a good hotel and it is cheap as well
it is a government that originated in the workers’ movement and indeed its name is literally “the labour party” to remind us
it is a key moment in mauritian history for us to stop and think
it is a regional struggle with others in the region and an international struggle with others worldwide
it is a situation that is becoming dangerous
it is about this that i wish to speak to you
it is all lies
it is also important for us to appreciate these kinds of crises as a mode of selfregulation of the system because it leads us to ask as the first point of departure in planning our strategy as to what kind of economic crisis are we looking at
it is also interesting to observe the degree of power they grant to the person who puts the riddle and the energy they put into it
it is also what needs the most experience
it is always in the interest of the multinational’s profit
it is always the balance of forces between you as the working class and them as the capitalists that determines whether your demands will be met
it is amazing to our eyes
it is an important moment to think about political economics
it is as tall as a huge tree
it is bad to lie
it is based on artificial land transaction values
it is based upon this knowhow that certain family enterprises have started to commercialize jam jelly fruit juice crystallized fruits pickles chutneys sometimes on a semiindustrial scale either in cans in bottles or plastic bags
it is because you dont have enough faith
it is bent on controlling pension funds and has already started investing in health and education
it is called beasts of england
it is charged with settling annual wage compensation bureaucratically instead of politically as has been the case since 1972 and significantly taking into account from now onwards “productivity” and “capacity for the employer to pay” as well as the rise in the cost price index
it is cold when it rains
it is difficult to forgive people
it is difficult to live here
it is getting the lion’s share of the billions of money called “accompanying measures” from the european union as compensation for the end of protectionism
it is important both from the point of view of analysis and obviously from the point of view of the positioning of the party itself in the context of the unfolding crisis to keep a close eye on these shifts as they develop
it is important for us to understand that under capitalism crisis also occupies a very different place
it is important so that the party isn’t always playing catchup
it is important that a program understands the way the ruling block is constituted and the place of the bourgeoisie within that block
it is important to see your doctor
it is important to understand these
it is in such a context that lalit is launching this campaign on a national level to force the government and the bosses and their lackeyideologues to open their eyes and look at what the future holds for all the humans of this land
it is in the spirit of all the human rights legislation that all human languages are equal
it is in their own nature to act for their particular interests unless they are forced by the development of the class struggle to act in the interests of other classes
it is in this spirit of human rights that we must stop the colonial prejudice that allowed education to be dispensed in languages the children do not speak naturally
it is late now
it is like a hammer
it is like learning a language
it is most important to record correctly the person from whom each story or other tradition has been taken
it is my fault for making you boast that you are as big as a ship
it is my first visit to your country
it is my lung said boxer in a weak voice
it is not a coincidence that the médine sugar estate company one week after the budget speech comes up with this project
it is not acceptable that people who possess capital do not create employment and people in need of a work do not have the capital that they themselves produced
it is not an ordinary event for anyone who studies history for anyone who knows labour’s history
it is not easy
it is not easy to drive
it is not good to steal
it is not just a question of exam results
it is not just one long crisis
it is not only a danger to our ecology but also to cultivation as well where gmos are not used
it is not only workers who need to be rallied nor just the unemployed that happen to have a free day to be present nor is it just numbers we’ve seen from the kaya rebellion in 1999 that numbers however huge are not enough there needs to be unity not just in the sense of everyone is at the same place at the same time but unity in our heads by that i mean unity on the question of what program there is in our heads and on the questions of how and when we can make progress on our demands
it is not surprising to find much more work accidents in this sector
it is not the kind of program the party drafts here in grnw and then goes out and tells other people about
it is not true
it is not unconnected like in the ordinary capitalist system
it is not very hot at present
it is now as everyone knows 60
it is on beverly
it is on these grounds that it will design its strategies in the long run
it is one that the lawyers also take very seriously indeed
it is only necessary that the people who keep a song or poem in memory should value it
it is our means par excellence of understanding the world around us
it is possible that
it is quite funny really to hear the mmm and its leader bérenger denouncing this budget as “ultraliberal”
it is quite important that the party of the working class is able to anticipate and understand and intervene decisively in the political debate within the society a debate that is unleashed by these conflicts in the ruling class and to have the structures in its own party that permit this debate
it is raining now
it is said
it is summed up in a single word man
it is the consciousness that some kind of revolution will be necessary people begin to realize in the course of the struggle that it will have to be us ourselves who put into practice our demands
it is the necessary “oil” that facilitates the working of the system
it is the same piece of land
it is the sugarcane spirit that’s giving us strength
it is therefore a familiar point at which to start your collection of mauritian folklore
it is this kind of financial speculation which sithanen is encouraging through a series of budgetary measures
it is this movement which is known as the alterglobalisation movement that has for a number of years now been explaining exactly what is happening to the people in mauritius today
it is through this type of ideological manipulation that the capitalists remain in control of society
it is thus imperative that school does not do any harm to children
it is time to leave home
it is too risky
it is true that some forms of cultivation and cattle rearing can be done on a large scale and that big investments are needed even if small scale farming is to develop
it is trying to get control of ceb and cwa thus adding electricity and water to its list
it is useless for you to worship me when you teach rules made up by humans
it is very comfortable to travel by train
it is very good for you
it is very heavy
it is weak for various reasons the present government has had clear mandates in three successive elections general elections the municipals and village elections
it isn’t true cried mollie beginning to prance about and paw the ground
it isn’t true repeated mollie
it lays eggs
it looks like something straightforward but it is important that we understand this
it may be better to start collecting from the people most like yourself young men if you are a young man married women if you are a married woman
it may refer in one persons mind to noise and in another person’s mind to impoliteness
it means also the clever and beautiful ways which people have found to solve problems that come up over and over for everyone
it means finding and alternative to the growing sameness of modern life
it means loads of different real textile factories it means 80 of our agricultural land and 11 sugar mills
it means the mother tongue to a high level plus another language that can develop to the same high level too that is to the level of calp
it means they must be recorded so that our children can know about their traditions and decide what they want to preserve
it might be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled but they were conscious that they were not as other animals
it must be due to some fault in ourselves
it must be some new kind of powerful teaching
it normally rules in blocks of alliances with other classes
it now appeared that snowball had not as the animals had previously imagined merely attempted to lose the battle of the cowshed by means of a stratagem but had been openly fighting on joness side
it now appeared that snowball was not after all hiding on pinchfield farm and in fact had never been there in his life he was living  in considerable luxury so it was said  at foxwood and had in reality been a pensioner of pilkington for years past
it occurs extremely rarely
it often involves a diviner
it ran
it ran down his face and onto his clothes so that when he got home he was as dirty as a little pig
it ran no animal shall kill any other animal without cause
it reminds us of old times
it reveals all its interconnections
it rolls along the floor clong clong clong
it said dont have anything to do with that innocent man because at night i have had nightmares because of him
it says no animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets she announced finally
it seemed to them as though snowball were some kind of invisible influence pervading the air about them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers
it should make us proud to be who we are
it shouldnt take too long
it shows that the interests of workers as a whole have not been assured by the concession
it sometimes happens that singers or poets will sing a song or say a poem twice
it started to float down the hill
it stays still
it swings to and fro
it understands that working peoples’ problems will not be resolved in the interests of working people so long as politicians like sithanen or bérenger are in power or so long as the bosses still control the factories the banks and everything else they control
it was 101
it was a big success
it was a bitter winter
it was a bus
it was a clear spring evening
it was a difficult decision but i applied and i was accepted
it was a dream of the earth as it will be when man has vanished
it was a few days later than this that the pigs came upon a case of whisky in the cellars of the farmhouse
it was a good beginning and the band asked him to join them
it was a good way to avoid crap
it was a hare
it was a letter from robert inviting me to come to his place for dinner
it was a moonlit night
it was a pig walking on his hind legs
it was a savage bitter battle
it was a shepherd with three hundred sheep
it was a source of great satisfaction to him he said  and he was sure to all others present to feel that a long period of mistrust and misunderstanding had now come to an end
it was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and took up their residence there
it was about whether should we move with the mass should we slow the mass down what should we do
it was absolutely necessary he said that the pigs who were the brains of the farm should have a quiet place to work in
it was almost half built now
it was also announced that the gun would be fired every year on napoleons birthday as well as on the other two anniversaries
it was also found that the stupider animals such as the sheep hens and ducks were unable to learn the seven commandments by heart
it was also more suited to the dignity of the leader for of late he had taken to speaking of napoleon under the title of leader to live in a house than in a mere sty
it was always the pigs who put forward the resolutions
it was announced that later when bricks and timber had been purchased a schoolroom would be built in the farmhouse garden
it was announced that the battle would be called the battle of the windmill and that napoleon had created a new decoration the order of the green banner which he had conferred upon himself
it was as if nature had an account to settle and it was settling it with a vengeance
it was as if nature had chosen us for an experiment to find a balance between extremes
it was as if the stress and frustration made people dump their crap on the weak and defenseless
it was as though the windmill had never been
it was as though they had never seen these things before and even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own
it was clovers voice
it was decided to set the gun up at the foot of the flagstaff like a piece of artillery and to fire it twice a year once on october the twelfth the anniversary of the battle of the cowshed and once on midsummer day the anniversary of the rebellion
it was evident where everything was heading
it was feared that the men might have harmed her in some way or even carried her off with them
it was fully realised that though the human beings had been defeated in the battle of the cowshed they might make another and more determined attempt to recapture the farm and reinstate mr jones they had all the more reason for doing so because the news of their defeat had spread across the countryside and made the animals on the neighbouring farms more restive than ever
it was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism tortured one another with redhot horseshoes and had their females in common
it was impossible not to prevent chaos from reigning
it was impossible now to venture out of the shelter of the buildings
it was impossible to compete with us
it was just after the sheep had returned on a pleasant evening when the animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm buildings that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard
it was just then that mr jones woke up
it was lucky that ratna let me stay with her until i could find some work
it was lucky that the owners of the two farms which adjoined animal farm were on permanently bad terms
it was mixed every day into the pigs’ mash
it was nearly nine oclock when squealer made his appearance walking slowly and dejectedly his eyes dull his tail hanging limply behind him and with every appearance of being seriously ill
it was not for this that they had built the windmill and faced the bullets of joness gun
it was not that these creatures did not work
it was noticed that they wagged their tails to him in the same way as the other dogs had been used to do to mr jones
it was noticed that whenever he seemed on the point of coming to an agreement with frederick snowball was declared to be in hiding at foxwood while when he inclined toward pilkington snowball was said to be at pinchfield
it was possible to foresee that the coming winter would be a hard one
it was precisely these issues that were discussed two to three years ago in mumbai
it was pure imagination probably traceable in the beginning to lies circulated by snowball
it was raining heavily
it was shining brightly and there was no rain
it was shown to you by my father in heaven
it was situated somewhere up in the sky a little distance beyond the clouds moses said
it was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found
it was strange stuff
it was terrible exercise it was violence against children
it was the first time that they had ever seen benjamin excited  indeed it was the first time that anyone had ever seen him gallop
it was the gate has been changed to 44d
it was the policy of the central government to promote industrial development in rural areas
it was the same with carreau filaos carreau eucalyptus carreau bois d’oiseau carreau tekoma
it was this institutional support arbitrarily handed out by governments and regimes one after the other to pump up sugar profits that has been a brake on the kind of agricultural diversification that would have averted the present crisis
it was uncertain whether boxer had understood what clover had said
it was very neatly written and except that friend was written freind and one of the s’s was the wrong way round the spelling was correct all the way through
it was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside world
it was with sunil from camp bombay that i discovered sexuality
it wasn’t clear whether they were maomao or mau mau
it went off he ran into a canefield and hid down under some straw for three days
it went on for five minutes without stopping
it will also increase people’s awareness of the depth and variety of human beliefs as we are living it
it will also mean the integration of the preserving of agricultural products into the sector
it will be felt in the marrow of our bones what this capitalist globalisation logic is
it will end next week
it would be the first time that he had had leisure to study and improve his mind
it would however not hesitate to “concede” to pressures from its own bankrollers the bosses
it would make me very happy

its never too late
its no longer needed comrade said squealer stiffly
its on this side
its owner mr pilkington was an easygoing gentleman farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting according to the season
its owner was a mr frederick a tough shrewd man perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains
its right there next to that restaurant
its the standard charge for the seat reservation
it’s a good thing for everyone
it’s a lie
it’s about whether based on the cost of production  it should be the sugar estates multinational corporations or the ceb itself that produces power
it’s about whether the ceb is producing electricity cheaper than the sugar estates
it’s all conditional on the conduct of the revolutionary forces whether they can solve the issue in their own interest in the interests of the classes they represent or whether the issue again gets resolved in the interests of the bourgeoisie
it’s all dark outside
it’s dangerous to go into the woods during the hunting season
it’s fantastic
it’s for a transfer
it’s for an extraction
it’s important to realize this
it’s important to understand this
it’s in this context of generalized flux that lalit has begun a national campaign to force government and the bosses and their accredited ideologues to wake up and act in the interests of the people of this country
it’s not a crisis of a part of the mauritian economy it is not because we want to deal with the special interests and the special problems of a section of the working class what we are observing what we are looking at is an unfolding generalized crisis
it’s not a real democracy when in the police you have people like raddhoa beating up so many people
it’s not just by means of repression that the government can govern as it does
it’s not only because of their capacity to repress us if we rise in rebellion or take part in demonstrations
it’s not serious
it’s obvious that the crisis of the sugar and textile industries presents itself in the main as a crisis of unemployment
it’s on this last aspect mentioned that i would like to lay stress that is to say on popular mobilization the mobilization of workers and poor people on the basis of the demands as a process that prepares the way to taking power

just around the corner let me know if you need anything else
just as right now the state is helping the maurel’s gowreesoo’s and rawat’s to get more of the blanket on their side of the bed at a time when the sugar estates are set to rake in fortunes on their exports and from their integrated resort scheme real estate deals and when the new mauritius hotels is declaring over a billion rupees in profits for the past six months
just before dawn malini falls asleep
just ears
just give the order and my servant will get well
just go and show the priest that you are well
just like in the playground
just now
just start up wait 3 days and if you don’t hear any objection there you go
just the bill please
just then the little mouse happened to pass by and seeing the sad plight in which the lion was ran up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the king of the beasts
just to please me
just to show how this is “the chronicle of a preannounced crisis” you will all remember how ministers like sushil kushiram berenger pravind jugnauth exfinance ministers of the previous msmmmm regime were already talking first about “jobless growth” and then afterwards saying maybe they had been wrong and that it was more accurate to refer to “jobloss growth”
just turn right and go all the way to end of this terminal and youll be in terminal 3

last year ledikasyon pu travayer invited a linguist of international reputation prof tove skutnabbkangas to give a public lecture on this theme and this is what she said if a child does not learn in his mother tongue and is forced to learn in a foreign language what you are doing this will do serious mental harm to the child

later
later i discovered that ratna was more worried than i was because when she was twelve her uncle had raped her and then killed himself
later i learned that because she hadn’t gotten any proposals her parents pressured her to marry when bhai farouk sent one
later jesus and his disciples were having dinner at levis house
later on
later on they had a storehouse built where they could stock a lot of the merchandise that khadija and farouk would buy once a month in the capital
later that evening he was still there
later there would also be need for seeds and artificial manures besides various tools and finally the machinery for the windmill
later these companies would take the surplus made by mauritian workers and go and invest in other countries where often they lost all that social capital
later when bala married i found a friend
later you can try asking them of other people in similar situations

many
many animals had been born to whom the rebellion was only a dim tradition passed on by word of mouth and others had been bought who had never heard mention of such a thing before their arrival
many are invited but only a few are chosen
many books containing one or more folktales are written for school children and others who are just learning to read
many characters and incidents occur in the folktales of both east africa and india and were probably brought to mauritius from there
many factories have already shut down
many false prophets will come and fool a lot of people
many folktales have thieves dishonest persons or tricksters as their main characters
many kinds of speech play games and riddles exist in mauritius waiting to be systematically collected
many mauritians share beliefs about magic witchcraft healing and supernatural powers which are separate from their official religion
many may be you feel strongly that old traditions are threatened by such change
many meetings were held in the big barn and the pigs occupied themselves with planning out the work of the coming season
many of the animals believed him
many of the unions are still probably in the procapitalist arms of the mmm msm and un from the days of the recent “platform national”
many of the young people who had gotten in on the plan hatched by the chairperson of foulousplennti and his accomplices ended up dead
many of these will be in groups which you can describe families sitting or standing together children playing old men chatting
many of us actually dislike milk and apples
many people think immediately of religion when they hear the word folklore
many people used to think that using the medium of a second language say english or french was an advantage and that the earlier this started the better
many preferred to emigrate and local culture went underground
many sega performers however have been recorded by persons who then made profits from their music by selling cassettes but giving no money to the artist
many sorts of folklore have not yet been collected in mauritius though they are certainly there
many such myths are kept alive by being told again and again
many tax collectors and other sinners were also there
many will come and claim to be me
many years ago when i was small my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words

mauritians are free to decide whether to preserve or let go of traditional clothes traditional foods or traditional proverbs
mauritians should begin to look at their own folklore simply because it is their own and it is valuable
mauritians speak several languages
mauritius
mauritius here we come
mauritius is not only small geographically but also economically relative to the world economy it is insignificant
mauritius must develop a market for ‘guaranteed gmofree’ products
mauritius rodrigues and agalega are blessed with constant south east trade winds that make wind energy very easy
mauritius was to produce food for its own needs and at the very most develop a common market for the mascarene zone
mauritius which is a signatory to the language plan of action has an undertaking therefore to introduce kreol and bhojpuri as medium

most of animal farm was within their view the long pasture stretching down to the main road the hayfield the spinney the drinking pool the ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green and the red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys
most of the actual collecting thoughwas done by ordinary persons  teachers priests school pupils

most of the people in danfour were farmers who had lost their land people who had lost their livelihood because communal property had been privatised and people who had lost their homes because developers had cheated them

napoleon acted swiftly and ruthlessly
napoleon appeared to change countenance and sharply ordered boxer to let the dog go
napoleon approved of this poem and caused it to be inscribed on the wall of the big barn at the opposite end from the seven commandments
napoleon called the animals together immediately and in a terrible voice pronounced the death sentence upon frederick
napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into snowball’s activities
napoleon ended his speech with a reminder of boxers two favourite maxims i will work harder and comrade napoleon is always right  maxims he said which every animal would do well to adopt as his own
napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of long live animal farm and after the singing of beasts of england the animals were dismissed
napoleon had accepted through whymper a contract for four hundred eggs a week
napoleon had commanded that once a week there should be held something called a spontaneous demonstration the object of which was to celebrate the struggles and triumphs of animal farm
napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of animalism
napoleon himself appeared at the meeting on the following sunday morning and pronounced a short oration in boxers honour
napoleon himself attended by his dogs and his cockerel came down to inspect the completed work
napoleon himself occupying the seat of honour at the head of the table
napoleon himself was not seen in public as often as once in a fortnight
napoleon now called upon them to confess their crimes
napoleon on the other hand argued that the great need of the moment was to increase food production and that if they wasted time on the windmill they would all starve to death
napoleon produced no schemes of his own but said quietly that snowball’s would come to nothing and seemed to be biding his time
napoleon read out the orders for the week in a gruff soldierly style and after a single singing of beasts of england all the animals dispersed
napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led the way down to the fivebarred gate that gave on to the main road
napoleon snuffed deeply at them and pronounced them to be snowball’s
napoleon stood sternly surveying his audience then he uttered a highpitched whimper
napoleon then led them back to the storeshed and served out a double ration of corn to everybody with two biscuits for each dog
napoleon took no interest in snowball’s committees
napoleon was a large rather fiercelooking berkshire boar the only berkshire on the farm not much of a talker but with a reputation for getting his own way
napoleon was by this time on slightly better terms with the other farmers than before
napoleon was hesitating between the two unable to make up his mind
napoleon was now a mature boar of twentyfour stone
napoleon was now never spoken of simply as napoleon
napoleon was so gratified that he left his place and came round the table to clink his mug against mr pilkingtons before emptying it
napoleon was well aware of the bad results that might follow if the real facts of the food situation were known and he decided to make use of mr whymper to spread a contrary impression
napoleon who seldom moved out of a walk raced ahead of them all
napoleon with squealer and another pig named minimus who had a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems sat on the front of the raised platform with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle round them and the other pigs sitting behind
napoleon with the dogs following him now mounted on to the raised portion of the floor where major had previously stood to deliver his speech

never
never before has their agenda been exposed so nakedly as it has been by the sithanen budget
never had the farm and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own farm every inch of it their own property appeared to the animals so desirable a place
never listen when they tell you that man and the animals have a common interest that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others
never mind the milk comrades cried napoleon placing himself in front of the buckets
never mind were leaving
never to have any dealings with human beings never to engage in trade never to make use of money had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed at that first triumphant meeting after jones was expelled
nevertheless
nevertheless as the summer wore on various unforeseen shortages began to make them selves felt
nevertheless some of the animals were disturbed when they heard that the pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen and used the drawingroom as a recreation room but also slept in the beds
nevertheless they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on animal farm and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning too much about it
nevertheless towards the end of january it became obvious that it would be necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere
nevertheless without openly admitting it he was devoted to boxer

now comrades what is the nature of this life of ours
now discerning between the two types of crisis is important for a political party
now everywhere we went there were signs no entry passage interdit private property
now generally we say socialism is presumed to be in the interests of the working class
now government in its attack on the historic bourgeoisie is saying  hold on hand over 2000 arpents of land first
now he knows where his friend is
now he must see a doctor
now how will we establish if the crisis is conjunctural or systemic
now i had to decide what i would do
now i have no excuse
now i must tell you that old laouret also had two sons
now i want to talk a little bit about what constitute the main elements of what we should conceive of or think about when we talk about an economic program that wants to put an alternative view of society an alternative approach to resolving the crisis
now in fact this budget comes and reveals clearly to everyone the consequences for the people when there will no longer be any protection
now in the main the bourgeois parties are not in the habit of acting collectively
now it can be the case that the immediate attack by the bourgeoisie takes place in the sugar industry but that may not tell us that the first wave of opposition will emerge in that sector our ability to establish where that next wave breaks is a test of the party’s capacity but the party cannot decree
now it is also an interesting and very difficult problem for the parties of the working class
now it is quite clear that if you leave aside the immediate economic interest of certain sections of the people as you interpret their needs it is quite clear that there is also an attempt here to preserve the hegemonic block in a particular way
now it would be instructive to look at the evolution of mauritian society and the sugar oligarchy
now it’s crucial for the revolutionary party to be sensitive to these movements between the ruling classes without of course accommodating itself to them
now let us examine the option sithanen has taken
now listen to me or i will use my front foot
now listen to the meaning of the story about the farmer
now now don’t be funny you are the king’s son my daughter is just a poor little girl
now old man lazybones had a cow
now pekoy also needs a fishing rod just like the fishermen have got
now prostitution especially around drugtakers but also around tourism has spread into new area after new area
now sinn sinn is not in the cocoon
now tell me if you have ever tasted such honey before
now that snowball was out of the way the plan could go forward without his interference
now that the government has announced its budget in what way will this affect the campaign we are already running
now that the small field beyond the orchard had been set aside for barley it was rumoured that a corner of the large pasture was to be fenced off and turned into a grazingground for superannuated animals
now that was a crucial political moment which allowed the production of a particular form of class rule in which the sugar bosses were able to extract all kinds of concessions that it did
now that we are making this grave accusation against your policies it will be clear to you that we are going to step up our campaign for the use of kreol and bhojpuri in schools and for other languages to be introduced additively so that we can put an end to this linguistic genocide
now the  other foot was stuck too
now the cook decided to have some fun with him
now the cow was always happiest when eating
now the crucial point about this here is that when the bourgeoisie responds to crisis obviously each section responds in ways that are consistent with its own interests
now the hare had put a spell on that honey
now the hare was mischievous
now the importance of a crisis and why it has to be treated as a special situation is certainly that the crisis represents a very profound change for all sections of society
now the point is that capitalism because of this anarchy has to continually reestablish its balance
now the queen had a son
now there are no dinosaurs left
now there are two last things i would like to talk about before coming to my concluding remarks
now there was a girl in my bed and both our families were outside expecting results
now they all will know
now they will have to compete on the global market and mauritius will have to be “competitive”
now this is not always selfevident
now this kind of privatization has as one of its additional aims that it attracts foreign investors
now this particular issue therefore needs to be developed in an understanding of the way the crisis unfolds
now trade unions in many instances for historical reasons they sometimes suffer from the problem that they imagine that they can achieve demands without any changes in the power relations
now we are going to take three examples in mauritius our country where many intellectuals congratulate themselves that we are a country of multilingual people but who would do better to admit that your policies are making us a country of demilingual people
now we will look briefly at the changes within the political power relations that are necessary for a program to be realized
now what are the important issues
now what are you going to do
now when it is almost too late when the sugar oligarchs have even gone and aggravated the situation by producing electricity from cane bagasse now the bosses and the government twenty years too late find themselves in a blind panic
now with me around a boarder who before long was like a child in their home khadija and farouk began to live again
nowadays
nowadays satellite photos are being used in some european countries for an assessment of the better use that land can be put to
nowadays there are factories which produce pasteurized milk yogurt or ghee
nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done in the past

on sunday mornings squealer holding down a long strip of paper with his trotter would read out to them lists of figures proving that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by two hundred per cent three hundred per cent or five hundred per cent as the case might be
on sundays there was no work
on the condition that
on the contrary food production in different forms has increased in cans frozen freezedried pickled dried and preserved in all forms
on the contrary we hear people saying “chuck bérenger out chuck pravind jugnauth out as minister of finance ramgoolam is telling us that he will ‘put the people first’ and we are the people so they will put us first so let us vote for ramgoolam

on the one hand there is the mass work of the party and this is quite fundamental
on the one hand we have dealt with the important element of establishing and confirming the validity of our analysis that the crisis is deeper than usual that people feel it is deeper than usual
on the other hand of course the party has inherited a whole period of work and a whole set of tools of analysis with which to analyze the evolution of social classes in society and the place of different industries within that society and the importance of the fractures taking place in the sugar industry and the processes going on in tourism
on the other hand the associations of small planters became stronger and developed a political voice through the advance group a team led by ss ramgoolam who stood against the labour party in the 1948 elections and would later actually “take over” the labour party
on the other hand the situation in unicity was catastrophic
on the other hand there is an alternative a budget can put forward the basis for a new productive apparatus

on which days
once a story like this is told among mauritians again and again it should be called a legend
once again all rations were reduced except those of the pigs and the dogs
once again clover and benjamin warned him to take care of his health but boxer paid no attention
once again it was being put about that all the animals were dying of famine and disease and that they were continually fighting among themselves and had resorted to cannibalism and infanticide
once again jesus used stories to teach the people
once again jesus went to the shore of lake galilee
once again pekoy takes his fishing rod along
once again some of the animals heard this with a certain bewilderment but squealer was soon able to convince them that their memories had been at fault
once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness
once again this argument was unanswerable
once his family had made the formal proposal siram used to come by
once i had qualified as a teacher and gotten experience i requested a position in danfour
once in a while members of different ngos would meet socially and professionally
once in a while they would take boarders
once they were married khadija helped farouk with his business
once upon a time there lived a great king who lived in a big castle
once upon a time there was a hunter who loved to go bird hunting
once upon a time there was a little boy whose name was little john
once upon a time there was a woman who had a son but the poor boy was very stupid one day his mother sent him to the market to buy an axe
once upon a time there was an old man they called old man lazybones
once when a lion was asleep a little mouse began running up and down upon him
once you collect and write down your materialyou should make two copies
once you make it legally compulsory for parents to send their children to school how can you force parents in tamarin or st pierre or any number of other areas to send their children to have religiously specific education dispensed this will we are obliged to inform you be another form of genocide this time based on transferring children from one religious group to another

one advantage that we have in mauritius is that we already have a long tradition of knowledge in the preservation and transformation of food people know how to make jam pickles chutneys and conserves from a diverse range of fruits and vegetables
one after another

one afternoon when he came to pick her up he gave me a bottle of red wine and a red rose
one animal puts blood on another‘s mouth to make him look guilty of murder
one can then observe the very deep dialectic between the organic crisis and its waves of conjunctural crises
one cant just talk about economic growth without taking stock of the deterioration on the social side
one day a car stopped outside the shelter and the driver got down and handed me an envelope
one day a dealer proposed a deal
one day as mollie strolled blithely into the yard flirting her long tail and chewing at a stalk of hay clover took her aside
one day father hare took a little walk
one day he caught a bird with golden feathers in his net
one day he gave me his whole library because he said there was no future in books
one day his wife just upped and left them
one day however the order went forth that all the windfalls were to be collected and brought to the harnessroom for the use of the pigs
one day i asked one of the leaders which it was
one day i got a message that sunil had been hospitalized and wanted to see me
one day i met solange who had lived in mimi camp a long time ago
one day i want to visit switzerland
one day in early summer squealer ordered the sheep to follow him and led them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm which had become overgrown with birch saplings
one day in standard 3 i felt sick at school hours
one day khadija asked me to consider continuing my studies
one day solange who lived in camp mimi — it was weird how much she resembled bala — told me that her boss was looking for workers
one day the egg starts to crack
one day the king decided to find a solution for his water problem
one day the officers of the king came to him and said someone was asking about becoming the caretaker of the pond
one day the queen needed some eggs to bake a cake
one day the secretary of mr verylively who had been financing our shelter came to see us to ask if we would let his employer come over for a visit
one day they’ll find a cure
one day when he came to the edge of the pond what did he find there
one day when he went out to play he caught a cricket
one day when noone was looking i kissed him on the mouth
one day when the boy was out taking a walk he passed by old lady laouret’s house and he went in
one doctor told the court that the womans physical and mental problems should lessen – and be easier to treat – once the baby was born

one false step and our enemies would be upon us
one finds these kinds of measures not only in mauritius but also abroad
one important specialist for birth is the midwife who helps women deliver babies
one in namibia where there was a major strike 1971 the other in south africa the durban strikes 1973
one is obviously talking here about the pace at which the crisis unfolds
one last thing i asked for a coke about 15 minutes ago
one month after i left farouk uncle phoned me and gave me the sad news
one mouse sits on the left side and the other one on the right side
one night he told me he had a boyfriend
one night there’s a dog that has been untied
one oclock
one of jesus followers pulled out a sword and he struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear
one of mr pilkington’s men was standing on the other side of the hedge
one of the cows broke in the door of the storeshed with her horn and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins
one of the important duties of mauritian folklorist is to find active tradition bearers and get them better known
one of their kinds of communication is folklore event  a single telling of a story performance of a custom or preparation of a traditional meal
one of them all but closed his jaws on snowball’s tail but snowball whisked it free just in time
one of them at once ran and grabbed a sponge
one of them was an expert in the jewish law
one of them which was named foxwood was a large neglected oldfashioned farm much overgrown by woodland with all its pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition
one of those islands is mauritius
one person in a family gets another out of danger
one reason for this lack is the difficulty of observing everything that is going on in a complex event
one reason is the importance of folklore in defining a group  arya samaj ismaili catholic and so on
one rolling rock and one budweiser please oh and a glass of water
one service you can perform for your community is keeping these beautiful songs and poems in memory
one specialist told the judge that the priority was keeping this woman alive
one sunday morning napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he had never at any time contemplated selling the pile of timber to frederick he considered it beneath his dignity he said to have dealings with scoundrels of that description
one sunday morning squealer announced that the hens who had just come in to lay again must surrender their eggs
one sunday morning when the animals assembled to receive their orders napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy
one symptom of this was that they had begun to call animal farm by its proper name and ceased to pretend that it was called the manor farm
one thing they don’t want you to know is who exactly they govern for once you’ve voted
one way in which people make use of folklore is to strengthen their sense of belonging to a group
one way of seeing folklore around you therefore is to look for things people do that strengthen their sense of belonging

sir imposing either totally or partially unknown or erroneously grasped languages as medium in education flies in the face of all established pedagogical principles that have been established and continue to be established
sir we remind you that in 1994 the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights ecosoc in its report on mauritius noted with concern that kreol and bhojpuri the languages used by a vast majority of the population were not being used in the mauritian education system and that the government was actively discouraging the use of these languages in all its institutions
sir you will remember that the may 1975 students strike was a rebellion whose main thrust was for the decolonization of education and for the use of kreol in schools

snowball also busied himself with organising the other animals into what he called animal committees
snowball also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses’ manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days
snowball and napoleon were by far the most active in the debates
snowball did not deny that to build it would be a difficult business
snowball fought bravely at the battle of the cowshed
snowball had found in the harnessroom an old green tablecloth of mrs jones’s and had painted on it a hoof and a horn in white
snowball has done this thing
snowball has sold himself to frederick of pinchfield farm who is even now plotting to attack us and take our farm away from us
snowball he suddenly roared in a voice of thunder
snowball is to act as his guide when the attack begins
snowball now gave the signal for the charge
snowball now launched his second line of attack
snowball read it aloud for ‎the benefit of the others
snowball was a more vivacious pig than napoleon quicker in speech and more inventive but was not considered to have the same depth of character
snowball was forgotten
snowball was in league with jones from the very start
snowball was known to be still skulking on pinchfield farm
snowball was racing across the long pasture that led to the road he was running as only a pig can run but the dogs were close on his heels
snowball was secretly frequenting the farm by night
snowball who had studied an old book of julius caesar’s campaigns which he had found in the farmhouse was in charge of the defensive operations
snuff box
so
so
so anyway it is clear that the government is under pressure from different international institutions local forces or various kinds and bourgeois ideologues
so be as wise as snakes and as innocent as doves
so be on your guard
so beasts of england was heard no more in its place minimus the poet had composed another song which began animal farm animal farm never through me shall come to harm
so crises are not only triggered because the working class is under pressure but the crises are sometimes triggered by reorganization of the ruling block
so do you like the room
so even those earning rs200000 a month not mentioning any names laughter as the newspapers that day referred to one such person will pay at the rate of 15 the same rate as a teacher earning rs1000015000 a month
so every time these waves broke outside of the industrial proletariat they were unable therefore to be in contact with the revolutionary parts of the working class and to inform other classes and to keep the historical continuity of the change in the tide of the revolution
so every time we talk about an “economic crisis” it is important that we are mindful of the fact that the economy is a social relationship it is not a production of mere “things” but it is how we relate to society how the power balance is organised
so far as he knew he said there was nothing worth reading
so far we know little about mauritian occupational folklore
so go and cast a line into the lake and pull out the first fish you hook
so government says that the “cost of separation” should not be too high
so he climbed up into the tree with his hide
so he got up and went with jesus
so he grabbed the man by the neck
so he opened up the sack and lazybones got out
so he told him six rupees and five cents
so he tried to test jesus
so he wanted to jump down in order to put a wedge under the rock that was his chair
so his mummy took the arrow and gave him a coconut instead
so his wife was left to his brother
so how did that fit
so how on earth at times like this can the government and bosses have the cheek to come and announce that “unfortunately” old age pensions as a right are no longer affordable
so i have to make a uturn and go back the other way
so i think these two points are a kind of preface to our discussion much as we are talking about the problems facing the working class in crises it is important that we be mindful of the fact that we are talking about potentially exciting political periods
so i will call you peter which means a rock
so if satan fights against himself how can his kingdom last
so in 4 to 5 years’ time sithanen will come to say “there you are” the brave measures i took have brought us an economic growth of 45 5 6”
so in such an instance the crisis is conjunctural this doesn’t mean that it might not be important
so in terms of strategy the question of how this structure in the party enables debate becomes an important part of the strategy
so instead of mauritius continuing to accept old technology and often ‘dumping’ of obsolete technology from europe and elsewhere we propose massive investment in new modern forms of powerproduction
so it has been the private sector bosses who have decided how to create jobs in what sectors and under what conditions
so it is important to understand the changes necessary in power relations implied by a program
so it is that the bosses take all the decisions about how to feed us
so keep on doing everything they did
so long as the sugar estate bosses get lots and lots of money for selling their land
so much
so much
so much
so much
so much so that if you walked in unicity you’d think you were in hong kong or singapore or new york or london or paris
so much the better
so much time but
so my disciples always be ready
so naturally we need to develop a program that covers all these social problems
so now again when we talk of the different considerations of strategy the issue here is what is the authority of the party in being able to facilitate an almost approximate kind of synchronization
so now you have all sorts of universities from australia and south africa opening up here
so our analysis must reveal these classes
so she had to eat the tender leaves of the  blackwood tree
so so
so tell us who hit you
so that
so that
so that is one kind of pressure
so that is why the elephant and the whale believe that the hare is stronger than they are
so that what with the songs the processions squealers lists of figures the thunder of the gun the crowing of the cockerel and the fluttering of the flag they were able to forget that their bellies were empty at least part of the time
so that you can follow my argumentation later i’d like to say that it is not normal that a labour government comes up with a budget like this one
so that you can receive a correct diagnosis and prompt treatment
so the 22nd of may we have a flight at 730 am
so the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest and when they came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared
so the boss has this windfall profit from a sales price of rs28 up to one of rs32
so the budget is now a fact
so the crisis is in some ways “the chronicle of an anticipated crisis”
so the disciples went over to him and woke him up
so the importance of the party is that throughout through its insight and experience it is able to keep an understanding of the continuity of those sources of “unrest”
so the important thing is that although as a matter of shorthand we talk about an “economic crisis” we should be mindful of the fact that an economic crisis can never really unfold in one compartment called “economic” in society
so the increase in prices comes along with depreciation
so the issue of the tempo is of course important to us because the whole range of different tactics is appropriate to each period characterized by a different tempo of struggle
so the king had all his cows slaughtered and skinned he had the hides hung out to dry had them all loaded onto a cart and sent off to be sold
so the king let him go
so the king’s woodcutter cut down all the colophane trees
so the measure turns out to facilitate real estate speculation and land transactions
so the message gets choked out and they never produce anything
so the politicians invite you to a public meeting provide you with some firecrackers a hamper of food and some drinks and they explain that there is an electoral campaign to organize so here are the flags or here’s the cloth you make the flags and we’ll organize a big rally
so the primary value of mauritian folklore is that it is emotionally important to us dear to us
so the queen took up her shawl put on her hat and her best shoes and together they went to laouret’s house
so the schoolboy took the feather sharpened it and used it instead
so the son of man is lord over the sabbath
so the title exposes very clearly what’s in sithanen’s head and what’s in the mind of the social alliance regime
so the title of the budget itself gives away the political fraud that the budget is two specific huge sectors of production that employ thousands and thousands of people are collapsing and instead we are heading for another economic reality where there is no hint as to what will in fact be produced
so the words of the prophet jeremiah came true
so there wont be any more tours today
so these are never the same
so these are some of the real alternatives that are part of the lalit campaign
so they brought all the sick people to jesus
so they looked for a way to arrest jesus
so they put the king in a sack and threw him into the pond
so they tied a rope around its tail
so they told jesus we dont know
so they went
so this analysis becomes quite crucial for instance analysis of the bourgeoisie in its relationship to other classes with which it has ruled as a block
so this has been a leitmotif of all the different political parties in power
so this indicates the importance of the dialectics in the kind of interchange in tempo in the class struggle
so this kind of control on the very way we are made to think needs to be exposed
so those are the three main budgetary measures
so to come to some of the most important issues of political debate what do you do when there is a riot
so we create compartments
so we have already commented on the budget as a whole
so we have to make a right turn on central avenue
so we have to persist with our demands and it is possible that the masses of the people will rapidly develop an understanding sometimes in history the speed with which people develop an understanding is must faster than you expect people just come to the conclusion collectively that now is the time to abandon past hollow hopes placed in the government and bosses
so we need to identify the social classes and the strata within the society that constitute the social basis of our programme
so we see that new ways of learning new ways of doing politics correspond to different phases of the struggle
so we will be forced to go back to novartis each time we sow and they will probably have the monopoly on this species and the price will thus depends only on them
so we will be looking at how we in lalit given that there’s this new budget with its own specific measures will need to adapt our ongoing campaign
so we will compare this budget with our program we launched a political program for an alternative economy quite a while ago even before the general elections
so we will look at specific measures in the budget and at how we will modify our campaign given these new measures being brought in for the next year to come and perhaps having effects for many years after that too
so when the european commissioners come and propose a reduction of 37 in the sugar price they will guarantee over the next 2 years all we can say is that such a proposal was eminently predictable
so when they come along with this “capacity to pay” they are really bluffing because they know that on principle the bosses can’t pay
so when we talk of “trade preferences” we are talking of two big sectors of production which employ more than 100000 people directly and indirectly
so when we use the word “ultra liberal” to describe this budget we must follow the logic we’ve just set out
so with these measures that is the irs more assistance on the part of the government is being provided to new irs projects to make these wild plans of médine’s come true and thus very quickly sithanen is going to increase “economic growth” but in a totally artificial way
so you can’t just hide behind the abstract words like “trade preferences”
so you try to relaunch the economy as the budget does by making existing companies make more profits
so you will work at this in the knowledge that it will never ever happen that all the union leaders at the same time agree with you

some
some are small some are medium and some are big

some beliefs are official they are the prescribed forms and observances of their religion as these are set forth by sacred writings and authorities
some cried and some wept
some day it was coming it might not be soon it might not be within the lifetime of any animal now living but still it was coming
some did it better than others one or two were even a trifle unsteady and looked as though they would have liked the support of a stick but every one of them made his way right round the yard successfully
some features remain the same others are different
some hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out for burial and the barrel of beer in the scullery was stove in with a kick from boxer’s hoof otherwise nothing in the house was touched
some have little horns
some just have ears
some more wine
some of the animals talked of the duty of loyalty to mr jones whom they referred to as master or made elementary remarks such as mr jones feeds us

some progress was made in the dry frosty weather that followed but it was cruel work and the animals could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before
some references
some riddles say that an object has two opposed qualities
some time later the master of those servants returned
some traditional and conventional methods have been used over the ages so as to increase production of plants but when genetic transfers are being used in food production it can be very dangerous
some will take to the streets as they are always “hotheaded” they’re always ready to fight at any suggestions of the bourgeoisie that they are going to temper with their rights they take to the streets immediately
some women dont like it if you call them mrs”
somebody
somebody comes to buy a 14 lb of tea
somebody else buys a litre of water
somebody who is illmannered
somebody who likes to flirt
somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer  except of course for the pigs and the dogs

someone

something that is interesting for tourists is an attraction
something was written beneath the wing
sometime later a few hunters captured the king and tied him to a tree while they went in search of a wagon to carry him on
sometimes
sometimes he speaks english and says “how are you”
sometimes it is one section of the working class taking a solo attempt on the ruling class and staffing the barricades alone
sometimes it will take you months to try to explain a certain demand and then suddenly the working class will understand directly
sometimes on the slope leading to the top of the quarry when he braced his muscles against the weight of some vast boulder it seemed that nothing kept him on his feet except the will to continue
sometimes parliaments and other powerful institutions are taken up by the crisis
sometimes people put into song what they do not dare to say in ordinary talk
sometimes people select a special person to keep and pass on the oral history of the place and people
sometimes the capitalists and their political lackeys agree to concessions on certain demands in order to avoid losing everything
sometimes the long hours on insufficient food were hard to bear but boxer never faltered
sometimes the older ones among them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the early days of the rebellion when jones’s expulsion was still recent things had been better or worse than now
sometimes the peasantry sometimes other different sections of society which do not belong to the bourgeoisie join its ruling block
sometimes the work was hard the tools had been designed for human beings and not for animals and it was a great drawback that no animal was able to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs
sometimes there’s a call “let’s get together let’s put a program together a set of demands that we will draw up together” but what we need to ask also is what assumptions are we making about the nature of the power relations that need to be changed in order for these demands to be realized
sometimes unions go into blocks and alliances without a clear understanding of what this is all about and it tends as someone has put it to all end in tears
sometimes variant forms are created by clever people

that is how john will get people ready for the lord
that is how we see the struggle ahead
that is just how they work here in mauritius
that is my message to you comrades rebellion
that is one choice
that is one of the eggs i bought from a woman called old lady laouret whose husband catches birds
that is our victory said squealer
that is precisely what is happening today under pressure from countries that produce sugar for the world market and earn about onethird of what the producers for europe earn countries like australia brazil and thailand the wto has declared the subsidies on beet sugar “illegal” under wto rules because europe sells some of this very sugar on the world market thus helping depress its price further
that is quite a crucial relationship because it must now face the crisis of this industry
that is that an economic crisis affects everything as a totality
that is the collective task before us
that is the true spirit comrade cried squealer but it was noticed he cast a very ugly look at boxer with his little twinkling eyes
that is they are not only reasonable but they are necessary
that is they mean while each of us has a watch or a motorcycle you own your house they the capitalists have a right to own threequarters of mauritius
that is to say how to ensure a transition from an economy based on preferential markets especially for sugar and textiles to an economy based on global competition
that is to say the sugar and textile industries can no longer rely on protected markets
that is to say when there is a threat of job losses do we just fight job losses
that is to say when we struggle for these demands where is it likely to lead us
that is we predicted that either alliance when it came to power would impose a “solution” to this economic crisis that would shift the entire burden of this crisis on to the backs of the poor and the working class who are in no way to blame for the crisis
that is what i came to tell you
that is what makes our conscious actions perkitan in our history that now lies before us
that is what you say jesus answered
that is why tales songs riddles proverbs house types clothes ways of cookery and pieces of folk art deserve your attention
that laptop is not cheap
that made all the difference as squealer did not fail to point out
that made up the teacher’s salary
that man hit me
that man would be better off if he had never been born
that means they have the right to own hundreds even thousands or hectares of land
that means understanding the contradictions and weaknesses inside the mauritian economy and how these structural weaknesses are affected by the changes in the world economy

that night in the fields near bethlehem some shepherds were guarding their sheep
that night robert’s car came to fetch me
that night the leader walked up to him and asked if he could sub for a band member who was sick
that night there came from the farmhouse the sound of loud singing in which to everyones surprise the strains of beasts of england were mixed up
that night there was the sound of uproarious singing which was followed by what sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven oclock with a tremendous crash of glass
that not knowing was the greater torture
that one
that purse is inexpensive
that room is perfect ill take it
that sack was so heavy
that same night he went to a bar where a band played now and then guys he knew
that sunday evening squealer explained privately to the other animals that napoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill
that too is a form of privatization here as anywhere else in the world children have to go to school people have to look after themselves when they are ill have to organize how to live in their old age
that was a great meal i thought the fish was prepared perfectly
that was also important in the civil war period in russia as well with the white army and so on because the theory of the “offensive” was transferred from the theory of the offensive in revolution into the civil war
that was our mistake comrade
that was part of the arrangement cried squealer jones’s shot only grazed him
that was perfect im full
that was the second kind of shift to a second stratum
that was theirs too but they were frightened to go inside

the animals believed every word of it
the animals blood boiled with rage when they heard of these things being done to their comrades and sometimes they clamoured to be allowed to go out in a body and attack pinchfield farm drive out the humans and set the animals free
the animals chased them right down to the bottom of the field and got in some last kicks at them as they forced their way through the thorn hedge
the animals could not face the terrible explosions and the stinging pellets and in spite of the efforts of napoleon and boxer to rally them they were soon driven back
the animals crowded round the van
the animals decided unanimously to create a military decoration animal hero first class which was conferred there and then on snowball and boxer
the animals distrusted pilkington as a human being but greatly preferred him to frederick whom they both feared and hated
the animals felt a little uneasy at this
the animals formed themselves into two factions under the slogan vote for snowball and the threeday week and vote for napoleon and the full manager
the animals found the problem insoluble in any case they had little time for speculating on such things now
the animals had assumed as a matter of course that these would be shared out equally
the animals had never heard of anything of this kind before for the farm was an oldfashioned one and had only the most primitive machinery and they listened in astonishment while snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds with reading and conversation
the animals had now reassembled in the wildest excitement each recounting his own exploits in the battle at the top of his voice
the animals had their breakfast and then snowball and napoleon called them together again
the animals hated moses because he told tales and did no work but some of them believed in sugarcandy mountain and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place
the animals huddled about clover not speaking
the animals knew that this was not the case
the animals lashed ropes round these and then all together cows horses sheep any animal that could lay hold of the rope even the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments they dragged them with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry where they were toppled over the edge to shatter to pieces below
the animals listened first to napoleon then to snowball and could not make up their minds which was right
the animals now also learned that snowball had never  as many of them had believed hitherto  received the order of animal hero first class
the animals rushed to the top of it and gazed round them in the clear morning light
the animals saw no reason to disbelieve him especially as they could no longer remember very clearly what conditions had been like before the rebellion
the animals slain in the battle were given a solemn funeral
the animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper
the animals watched his coming and going with a kind of dread and avoided him as much as possible nevertheless the sight of napoleon on all fours delivering orders to whymper who stood on two legs roused their pride and partly reconciled them to the new arrangement
the animals watched them and a murmur of dismay went round
the animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig when they were astonished to see benjamin come galloping from the direction of the farm buildings braying at the top of his voice
the animals were at breakfast when the lookouts came racing in with the news that frederick and his followers had already come through the fivebarred gate
the animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be
the animals were hard at work building yet another windmill when that one was finished so it was said the dynamos would be installed
the animals were not badly off throughout that summer in spite of the hardness of their work
the animals were not certain what the word meant but squealer spoke so persuasively and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so threateningly that they accepted his explanation without further questions
the animals were shocked beyond measure to learn that even snowball could be guilty of such an action
the animals were so disturbed that they could hardly sleep in their stalls
the animals were stupefied
the animals were taken aback
the animals were thoroughly frightened
the animals were weeding the turnip field
the animals would still assemble on sunday mornings to salute the flag sing beasts of england and receive their orders for the week

the birds at first objected since it seemed to them that they also had two legs but snowball proved to them that this was not so
the birds did not understand snowball’s long words but they accepted his explanation and all the humbler animals set to work to learn the new maxim by heart
the birds jumped on to their perches the animals settled down in the straw and the whole farm was asleep in a moment

the crisis can sometimes develop a step at a time when there are no major breakouts of any major struggles and there’s a bit of defensive action in this or that corner
the crisis in the sugar industry today is a direct and predictable result of the introduction of wto rules and of the restructuring of agriculture in a european union which is growing in size all the time
the crisis is in the productive apparatus of textiles and sugar
the crisis is not always moving in step
the crisis’ vigour and tempo can also be determined by the internal reorganization of the ruling block
the critical point in history was when the organizations of this stratum this class of small planters staked its claim on the sugar industry and reached an accommodation with the sugar oligarchy

the first problem is the loss of jobs
the first responsibility of a political party like lalit is analysis it must accurately analyze the economic crisis it must analyze both the local and the international dimensions of the crisis
the first thing by way of example is to open up discussion about the need for the program of the party or the movement to make clear the centrality and importance of sugar and textiles in mauritius
the first thing i’ll do is to analyze what the social alliance government’s budget proposes to do in the context of this economic and social crisis

the front of a building is called a facade
the full name of the trotsky program is “the death throes of capitalism and the tasks of the 4th international”

the government and the employers are not looking at what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of people directly concerned when these two main sectors of the economy are collapsing and heading for bankruptcy
the government has allowed mill after sugar mill to close down with more and more joblosses leaving the countryside without any serious employment prospects at all
the government has brought about deregulation even from the point of view of the environment
the government is under pressure from the local bourgeoisie and from international financial advisors
the government just signs a bit of paper and the value of the land soars
the government must change the law on biotechnology so that it will be based on the ‘precautionary principle’
the government must invest in this kind of industry instead of spending large sums of money for the benefit of the textile tourist and sugar sectors capitalists
the government must use the “european compensation” for which negotiation are taking place in exchange for the sugar protocol dismantling for this food production campaign and stop perpetuating a squandering sugar industry
the government replies by threatening more and more repression
the government slogans about “biotechnology” are not solutions neither are new techniques like gmo which aims only at guaranteeing the profit of multinationals which has control on this technology
the government threatens it with the competition bill “no more controlling imports and retailing no more one company holding too big a share of the market no more stocking only one brandmark”

the hare came to the elephant “oh dear my friend”
the hare came to the whale at the shoreline saw that the water was all red with blood and called to the whale
the hare continued to swim in the water
the hare felt it slightly but thought nothing of it
the hare gave a great laugh took off his clothes and dived into the pond
the hare kicked him with his hind foot the foot stuck
the hare laughed then he sat down on the rock
the hare left the whale
the hare raised his head collected all his strength and hit
the hare raised his voice
the hare said to him
the hare said to him “listen i will go to fetch a strong rope”
the hare said to him “you really are huge but it is not size alone that makes strength”
the hare saw something very black in the middle of the path he stopped and looked around
the hare saw the rifle pointed at him
the hare started off quickly
the hare thought a little he came closer he looked closer still nothing moved
the hare took the other end of the rope to the elephant and said to him “tie this tight”
the hare was shocked

the harnessroom at the end of the stables was broken open the bits the noserings the dogchains the cruel knives with which mr jones had been used to castrate the animals were all flung down the well
the harvest is more important
the harvest was a little less successful than in the previous year and two fields which should have been sown with roots in the early summer were not sown because the ploughing had not been completed early enough
the hat was white
the hens and ducks for instance saved five bushels of corn at the harvest by gathering up the stray grains
the hens and ducks with their sharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk
the hens perched themselves on the windowsills the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud
the hens said napoleon should welcome this sacrifice as their own special contribution towards the building of the windmill
the hens woke up squawking with terror because they had all dreamed simultaneously of hearing a gun go off in the distance

the historic bourgeoisie also still controls a good deal of the import trade much of it on a monopoly basis
the historic bourgeoisie cries in reply “new conditions down with new conditions”
the historic bourgeoisie expects to continue getting the same state support is has had throughout modern history when it has been in an alliance even though often conflictual with the politically strong small planters which has ensured a fairly stable ruling block
the historic bourgeoisie has also invested in tourism and finance
the historic bourgeoisie has also still stuck to the textiles that it has invested in over the past 30 or 40 years though the sector has gone hitech delocalized to madagascar bangladesh and india and brought in contract workers from abroad to live in hostels and work work work undercutting mauritian labour practices
the historic bourgeoisie is often allied with french andor south african capital
the historic bourgeoisie was too strong economically and politically as well as in the media so it won
the historical bourgeoisie which owns and controls most of the land and especially most of the prime agricultural land did not agree to diversify

the idea that folklore can be found mostly among ignorant or uneducated people is wrong
the idea that folklore means ignorance illiteracy and savage customs is also wrong
the important issue is that the fairly extended period of the crisis can pass through periods of calm where things appear to have been resolved and then problems start up again
the important lesson from south africa about this is that first of all there were groups on the left that through a theoretical schema decreed the primacy of the industrial working class
the important lesson is that one cannot decree in advance which section of the working class will come into action
the important point is when the crisis that we characterize as an organic crisis begins it leads to a chain of conjunctural crises

the king was still sad but he had to laugh
the kingdom of heaven is for them
the king’s anger knew no bounds he had the cow caught and taken away to be cooked and eaten
the king’s servant saw all this and returning to his master’s house he said to the king “i saw old man lazybones at the market he bought himself a whole crate of vegetables and paid five piasters but when the merchant tried to give him his change he wouldn’t take it”
the king’s servant saw him ran to the king and said “king king that’s old man lazybones passing by look at him with all those sheep”
the king’s son gave the bird to the cook and said “cook the heart and head and put them aside for me but do not use any curry”

the mauritian climate and soil is ideal for this kind of diversified food crop
the mauritian economy is in big enough trouble to warrant it
the mauritian government helped them by passing a law the “genetically modified organisms act” in march 2004 this gave legal support for the utilization marketing and application of gmos in the alimentary and agricultural sectors
the mauritian sugar bosses thus remained couched in the “comfort” of a guaranteed market and were not interested much in agricultural diversification or in food production
the meade report an enlightened report in favour of agricultural diversification
the meal was not ready
the measures the government and bosses are proposing now will not have any really positive affect and this neither in the short nor long term

the mmm made “selfreliance” its reason for land reform
the mmmmsm governments true consideration is to produce as per the wto philosophy not with and for scientific progress
the mmmpsm government did not take kindly to our slide show and talk series
the mmm’s governmental program for the 1976 general elections still put emphasis on job creation through diversification and industry and on the development of marine resources and the need to nationalize 5 estates and 20000 arpents of land for the purposes of this diversification

the next day i asked ratna dario bala and gerard to come meet me on an urgent matter

the party cannot establish a priori while sitting in a room having discussions that a crisis is systemic or isn’t  just through theoretical analysis or its critique of the political economy
the party does mass work
the party doesn’t just act like political scientists do read up and then go home to supper
the party has begun
the party has the role of pointing to the fact that all these different problems are pointing to a crisis to an organic crisis
the party often has to struggle hard to hold the working class to hold back those who want to act too fast alone to keep the working class together
the patch would shrink and tear a bigger hole

the people of nazareth turn against jesus
the people were waiting for him
the peoples’ interests were never served by this kind of blinkered thinking
the performance of mauritian folklore always differs from the way in which customs were performed in people’s countries of origin
the period in south africa from the 1960s to the early 90’s is filled up with alternating tempos in the class struggle
the pharisees and sadducees came to jesus and tried to test him
the pigeon gave him a feather
the pigeons had been told to avoid pinchfield farm and to alter their slogan from death to frederick to death to pilkington
the pigeons swirled into the air and all the animals except napoleon flung themselves flat on their bellies and hid their faces
the pigeons who were still sent out to spread tidings of the rebellion were forbidden to set foot anywhere on foxwood and were also ordered to drop their former slogan of death to humanity in favour of death to frederick
the pigs appeared completely at ease in their chairs
the pigs did not actually work but directed and supervised the others
the pigs ears were bleeding the dogs had tasted blood and for a few moments they appeared to go quite mad
the pigs fell silent and sat down again
the pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by moses the tame raven
the pigs had great difficulty in making them see that this was contrary to the spirit of animalism
the pigs had sent out a large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine chest in the bathroom and clover administered it to boxer twice a day after meals
the pigs had set aside the harnessroom as a headquarters for themselves here in the evenings they studied blacksmithing carpentering and other necessary arts from books which they had brought out of the farmhouse
the pigs now revealed that during the past three months they had taught themselves to read and write from an old spelling book which had belonged to mr jones’s children and which had been thrown on the rubbish heap
the pigs were in ecstasies over napoleons cunning
the pile of timber was still unsold
the place i lived was called camp ramsamy
the place is dirty

the population in papua new guinea is around 5 million and it is the country which has the highest number of languages in the world

the practical measures must be discussed also what practical measures are we talking about
the prejudice against the kreol and bhojpuri languages that they are supposedly inferior languages comes directly from colonial times when the colonists and their academia the civil servants and even the religious hierarchy believed and spread the false belief that these languages are inferior
the present system cannot deal with these demands
the present system evaluates agricultural production on the amount of “profit” that land owners make
the present system will be put into question when we put forward these eminently reasonable demands
the press boycotted them galleries snubbed them
the press is one among others
the press which was in the pocket of big money censored them even though they themselves were officially against censorship
the price of these would pay for enough grain and meal to keep the farm going till summer came on and conditions were easier
the primary schools where the studies were conducted were divided into 3 categories
the principal beneficiary will be papernoula
the problem all mauritians have faced is how to preserve their own reality in the face of extreme differences from other people around them
the production of vegetables would thus fall considerably
the program must be constantly permanently discussed convincing new people of its pertinence and being convinced by other peoples’ ideas which after discussion get incorporated but what is important and takes time and experience is to constantly be in discussion with the organizations that agree to struggle on the basis of the demands in the program
the program must include the development of such a political strategy and it must identify the forces that are going to move that strategy forward
the program on the death throes of capitalism also spoke of the mass mobilization around a transitional program as the preparation for taking power
the proportion of researchers can also be changed – if the ‘integrated nature’ of this approach is respected
the protectionist regime under which the sugar industry grew and survived in colonial times is now being dismantled really fast there will no longer be the same quotas and guaranteed prices that excolonies like mauritius have had when they produce for and export to europe
the public is advised not to venture at sea
the public is advised to take preliminary precautions
the queen bent down picked up the lump and examined it closely
the queen said not a word and left the kitchen
the queen said to her son “do you know what we need to do you must marry old lady laouret’s daughter that way we will get her bird”
the queen’s son ran to laouret’s house and said to her “old lady i love your daughter and want to marry her give her to me what do you say”
the question is why does this happen like this
the question we are asking is “is this a crisis of self regulation”

the range that used to pay 2530 tax will soon disappear
the rats which had been troublesome that winter were also said to be in league with snowball
the reader of a children’s book however is a different audience from a group of family members and friends listening to a village storyteller at night
the reading and writing classes however were a great success
the real answer ofcourse is that traditional culture is a treasure of the nation
the reason folklore materials are put together in an archive is that mauritians and foreign scholars need to compare the traditions of various members of each group to examine everything that is known about the traditions of mauritius and to compare mauritian folklore with the folklore of la reunion seychelles madagascarindia africa and europe
the recession spread its tentacles everywhere
the recording of mauritian folklore can be carried out on a large scale or a small one
the relations between napoleon and pilkington though they were only conducted through whymper were now almost friendly
the remains of a building structure etc are called ruins
the remotecontrol doesnt work
the repression used against drugs has only served to aggravate the problem
the republic of the animals which major had foretold when the green fields of england should be untrodden by human feet was still believed in
the research shows that if children are forced to learn through a language that they are not at ease in or do not master that they suffer immense disadvantages and that the disadvantage can almost never be compensated for later
the rest have all gone to market to bring in money for jones and his men
the rest of the animals sat facing them in the main body of the barn
the restaurant zone is about 5 blocks from there
the result is that all the members of any group know something often other groups and many members areas proficient in the cultural activities of other groups as of their own

the second issue is that such a program has to quite clearly identify for us the classes that underpin this whole program of the revolutionary party
the second issue of course is the party’s own penetration into the working class in its various strata
the second kind of crisis is of course of a much more fundamental character
the second most important commandment is like this one
the second one is what i call the problems of synchronization of the crisis
the second part of my paper aims to look at the budget while asking the question “what choice is there”
the second task of a political party is to put forward a program based on demands
the second thing is a point ram has already made in his introduction around this concept of understanding this new totality of things affected
the sermon on the mount
the service was friendly because they knew everyone in their area
the seven commandments
the shed where snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill had been shut up and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off the floor
the sheep spent the whole day there browsing at the leaves under squealers supervision
the sheep were the greatest devotees of the spontaneous demonstration and if anyone complained as a few animals sometimes did when no pigs or dogs were near that they wasted time and meant a lot of standing about in the cold the sheep were sure to silence him with a tremendous bleating of four legs good two legs bad
the shepherd heard all this and said to lazybones “hey old man if you want i will take your place”
the shepherds were frightened
the shop is selling damaged products

the soil feels soft very soft under his paws
the soil of england is fertile its climate is good it is capable of affording food in abundance to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it
the solution as i see it is to work harder
the son of man will die as the scriptures say
the sound travels across the lagoon
the source of the trouble appeared to be that napoleon and pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously
the spirit from your father will tell you what to say

the st martin project has been one of those experiences where waste from one production unit is recycled naturally into the next stage without it being of any cost eg chicken waste becomes fertilizer
the staircase is very slipery because it it rained
the state is in fact hindering our people in the natural expression of our languages bhojpuri and kreol it is this that makes the government responsible through the schools in particular for a crime against humanity the crime of linguistic genocide that is what we are accusing you of mr minister
the story about the girl who marries a wolf suggests to an adult that young women should take their parents’ advice about whom to marry
the story elements listed here are thought of as imaginary

the strike did have one positive effect when it directly brought in free secondary education but otherwise the degree of colonization in education is still overwhelming especially as concerns the medium of instruction

the study showed that all the zambian children were educated through the medium of english the study concludes that there was large numbers of zambian children all educated in english have very weak or zero reading competence in 2 languages
the stupidest questions of all were asked by mollie the white mare
the sugar bosses were furious too
the sugar industry bosses thus continued pocketing their shortterm profits year after year plus they benefited from all sorts of state aid mainly through a series of institutions and fiscal concessions
the sugar industry even they admit it now at long last has no future
the sugar industry has gone into a crisis so deep that it cannot be alleviated by the depreciation of the rupee nor even by a devaluation
the sugar industry is already in a deep crisis
the sugar will dissolve in the water

the title of the budget speech is “securing the transition from trade preferences to global competition”

the titledeeds which were in his own possession were owned by the pigs jointly
the tortoise began to walk taking the hare to the king’s house
the tortoise came up to the king and asked him if he could go on the errand to grandmother spider’s house
the tortoise kept on walking he paid no attention at all
the tortoise kept on walking without a word
the tortoise looked like a huge rock
the tortoise said to him “here he is your majesty it would not be tortoise you will be eating tonight but hare stew”
the tortoise set out to return
the tortoise spoke politely with grandmother spider and pleaded with her for her answer until finally she said “cut down the colophanes”
the tortoise stuck his head out from under his shell
the tortoise took no notice
the tortoise walked and walked very slowly but always straight ahead never dawdling
the tortoise was laughing the hare was crying
the tortoise went away
the tortoise’s head was hidden beneath his shell nothing moved

the two criminals also said cruel things to jesus
the two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings which had lost their mother filed into the barn cheeping feebly and wandering from side to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on
the two of them usually spent their sundays together in the small paddock beyond the orchard grazing side by side and never speaking
the two with the hammer and the crowbar were drilling a hole near the base of the windmill
the unbelieving towns
the unicity became a little un
the unicity demanded and got autonomy
the unions rightly boycotted this “tripartite” council and the government has nominated five individual trade unionists of its own choice
the university of mauritius should orientate research towards agricultural production based on traditional knowledge not on its substitute
the vegetable was expensive
the vegetables landed up all over the place
the very first question she asked snowball was will there still be sugar after the rebellion
the very next morning the attack came
the victims were usually women and children

the whale landed in the coral and cut himself
the whale looked at him and laughed
the whale pulled from his side the elephant pulled from the other side
the whale stuttered
the whale swam near the beach
the whale tied the rope around his tail and waited
the wheat crop was full of weeds and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn
the whips also went into the fire
the whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill
the whole of mauritius he announces has lost acquired rights
the whole of the big pasture including the windmill was in the hands of the enemy
the whole thing would be over in a fortnight they said
the wild creatures such as rats and rabbits are they our friends or our enemies
the windmill had been successfully completed at last and the farm possessed a threshing machine and a hay elevator of its own and various new buildings had been added to it
the windmill had ceased to exist
the windmill however had not after all been used for generating electrical power but for milling corn and brought in a handsome money profit
the windmill presented unexpected difficulties
the windmill was in ruins
the wine would swell and burst the old skins
the winter was as cold as the last one had been and food was even shorter

the woman took the coconut broke it and ate it
the woman was furious and wanted to beat him so he had to run and hide
the woman was so disgusted with him
the word legend is often used to mean an untrue history
the word of god
the word went round that from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky
the words people say or sing in their folklore must be written down just as they are said
the words ran
the work conditions were difficult but at least i got a rare taste of freedom unknown in my domestic servitude to my inlaws
the work of teaching and organising the others fell naturally upon the pigs who were generally recognised as being the cleverest of the animals
the work was hard
the workers in the years 193040 were organized in unions and also politically in the labour party and the bissoondoyalist movement
the working class creates new organizations and they begin then to sustain them
the working class had its interest elsewhere agricultural diversification was in its interests
the working class is not always “the” working class
the working class reacts differently in the different phases
the world
the world is round
the world’s already overpopulated
the worship of ammen the tamil mother goddess brings hundreds together to take part in different ways
the wounds on snowballs back which a few of the animals still remembered to have seen had been inflicted by napoleons teeth
the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees
the young man said i have obeyed all these
the young pigs were piebald and as napoleon was the only boar on the farm it was possible to guess at their parentage
the younger one is kindand so is helped by people becomes rich and gets rewards
the youth became increasingly impatient
the “bureaucracies” and political nominees at the head of all these institutions in turn for their own “comfort” developed a kind of vested interest in the continuation of the sugar oligarchs’ profits
the “sugar protocol” under the lome convention has reached its limit

their attitude is justified by the fact that here as everywhere in the world individual items of folklore do die out
their bodies were buried in the orchard and it was given out that they had died of coccidiosis
their cognitive progress is very much faster and gets to a higher level throughout the rest of their lives if they learn through their mother tongue at school
their ears are stopped up and their eyes are covered
their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it
their lives now they reasoned were hungry and laborious was it not right and just that a better world should exist somewhere else
their many informal conversations surrounding the central areaand the kinds of folkloric communication going on within and outside the house
their method was to fly up to the rafters and there lay their eggs which smashed to pieces on the floor
their money wasnt there anyway it was in banks overseas
their most faithful disciples were the two carthorses boxer and clover
their political will as far as we can decode it is to destroy the knowledge on the preservation of seeds and the transmission of seeds “free” so as to replace this system by the system of seeds produced by monsanto and sold in cans
their preparedness basically to come to terms with the fact that there are new ways of learning there are new ways of doing things and that inasmuch as it is important that we go through the crisis with all the preparation that is needed it is also very important that we understand that crises are very new situations and they require new kinds of energies
their project was not convincing because it persisted in seeing agricultural diversification only in terms of national production separate from the rest of the world
their relations with the human race were now not quite the same as they had been before
their traditions deserve study
their wives or husbands no longer love them

there had been a lot of development bridges highways buildings bungalows but the houses that had been promised to the inhabitants has never materialised

therefore all new forms of agriculture must include the question of how to bring more democracy to the workplace how to establish democratic control and free circulation of knowledge on agriculture how scientific progress can bring about the welfare of every human being and the protection of the environment from pollution
therefore an analysis of the position of these industries and their interconnections with other industries becomes quite crucial and needs to be made a much more visible part of our program
therefore many people think anyone interested in traditional culture will be bound to profit from it
therefore my last point is that there are no final crises
therefore observe and record
therefore observe and record as much as possible about the specific details of performance here
therefore pray the lord in charge of the harvest to send out workers
therefore record all sorts of traditionnal words and behavior even what you have already recorded from other persons or in other neighborhoods
therefore record what people are actually doing today as well as what they say about what was formerly done
therefore versions of the tale in all regions and languages must be carefully recorded

these are called folktale “motifs
these are common property within the group but not outside
these are demands that after world war ii the capitalists knew they had to concede otherwise they would end up without a capitalist system at all in those countries
these are held out to tourists and visitors as colourful examples ofthe variety ofcultures in mauritius
these are probably the easiest kind of story to collectbecause people tell them as true
these are the two biggest sectors of the economy the textile industry employs 40000  50000 people even though the numbers have decreased drastically
these are two big work sectors
these are two huge sectors where no new employment will be created and where on the contrary there will be a reduction in employment
these are unofficial and “in formal
these are what make you unclean
these books suggest indirectly that folktales are mainly suitable for children
these demands will only be met when the people the workers themselves through their organizations whether clubs associations unions or political parties like lalit or muvman premye me realize that it is only through their own struggle and their own mobilization that their demands will be able to be met
these families come to live in their bungalows only on weekends or on school holidays

these pants are too tight
these people will listen and listenbut never understand
these persons did their collecting by working throughout the handbook of irish folklore a set of questionnaires put out by the commission to show what folklore might be found
these plots are favorites of mauritian storytellers there are many more

these scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when old major first stirred them to rebellion
these seven commandments would now be inscribed on the wall they would form an unalterable law by which all the animals on animal farm must live for ever after
these shoes fit me well
these should be recorded
these sleeves are too long
these technologies are already mastered and are very successful
these tempos alternate
these things will have to happen first but that isnt the end
these three essays are one of lalit’s contributions
these three had elaborated old major’s teachings into a complete system of thought to which they gave the name of animalism
these three testimonies show to what extremes this mental harm can go
these two bags are mine
these two disagreed at every point where disagreement was possible
these two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come to any agreement even in defence of their own interests
these two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves but having once accepted the pigs as their teachers they absorbed everything that they were told and passed it on to the other animals by simple arguments
these wellintentioned people weren’t organised they had no influence on those who decided
these were the very words we used in our party political broadcasts on tv and radio during the electoral campaign
these would meet in private and afterwards communicate their decisions to the others
these “awards” determine minimum work conditions for different grades of workers in many many different sectors
thesis

they accepted everything that they were told about the rebellion and the principles of animalism especially from clover
they added that snowball had privately admitted to them that he had been joness secret agent for years past

they all come down to look for a little something to eat
they all cowered silently in their places seeming to know in advance that some terrible thing was about to happen
they all declared contemptuously that his stories about sugarcandy mountain were lies and yet they allowed him to remain on the farm not working with an allowance of a gill of beer a day
they all have front and back legs
they all remembered or thought they remembered how they had seen snowball charging ahead of them at the battle of the cowshed how he had rallied and encouraged them at every turn and how he had not paused for an instant even when the pellets from jones’s gun had wounded his back
they all stopped talking
they all yelled nail him to a cross

they are activities which a family a group of friends or a community engage in
they are afraid of illness or death
they are also working on a new speeded up “restructuring” plan this will mean more of the deadly job destruction of vrs and mill closure
they are but only when you book two weeks in advance
they are extinct like the dodo
they are ill or unable to work
they are important to us but they are not important to the mauritian capitalists or to international capitalists
they are interested in you so that they can make profits from your labour
they are like a flock of lost sheep
they are lying to us in fact they have lied to us for far too long
they are moved by it
they are not saying what kind of factories they are talking about
they are not supposed to do that
they are only interested in you as workers because you can work for them and through you and your work they can enrich themselves
they are principally concerned with setting up new sectors in a way that ensures the continuation of their profit and their capacity to continue making profit whatever the social cost and despite the cost to the ordinary people
they are reorganizing the economy precisely because the way it was isn’t working anymore
they are spoken only at certain times by certain persons adults to certain other persons children
they are taking boxer to the knackers
they are the most highly developed kind of oral art
they are then helped out of the animal’s stomach
they are too strong i will abandon
they are unable to have children
they are unable to have sex

they both did their best but neither was able to pull the other away
they called it gmo genetically modified organisms
they called it “papernoula”
they called their movement mawmaw
they came to a place named golgotha which means place of a skull
they came to school without slates chalk notebooks or textbooks
they can be paralysed by it
they can dig for worms in the sea
they can even be diametrically opposed
they can for example vote to introduce unemployment benefit but they will only do it if you are mobilized strongly enough outside of just as they might five years later revoke the same law and do away with unemployment benefit if the bosses and government see that the workers’ movement has perhaps weakened that the capitalist system is heading for some crisis that profits are falling that bankruptcies are on the rise then they will stop unemployment benefit
they can help
they can trample all over them and turn and attack you
they can try and clean it rub it off wash it off whatever they do theyll still have some mud on them
they can use hermit crabs he says
they cannot see or hear or understand
they clearly show that a large part of our economy is in deep deep trouble
they connect it with another way of life which is bound to disappear if it hasn’t disappeared already
they continued to behave very much as before and when treated with generosity simply took advantage of it
they control you by means of manipulating you ideologically
they could not knock it down in a week
they could not remember anything with which they could compare their present lives
they could not understand they said how even animals could bring themselves to sing such contemptible rubbish
they could only be traced for a few yards but appeared to lead to a hole in the hedge
they dance around the casuarina tree
they dashed straight for snowball who only sprang from his place just in time to escape their snapping jaws
they decided to go and search for the sun
they did not intend reducing sugar production but thought it needed to be limited
they did not know when the rebellion predicted by major would take place they had no reason for thinking that it would be within their own lifetime but they saw clearly that it was their duty to prepare for it
they did not know which was more shocking the treachery of the animals who had leagued themselves with snowball or the cruel retribution they had just witnessed
they do not drop out
they do not want to stay here
they dont even wash their hands before they eat
they dont work hard to make their clothes
they don’t consult each other
they don’t even bother to tell us whether there will be jobs created in this new “global competition” economy
they don’t realise marde is speaking another language
they don’t say
they don’t say what will be cultivated
they drank wine and rum
they even built a place where a local could stay
they explained that by their studies of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles of animalism to seven commandments
they felt that they were responsible for the death of their child but they didn’t fully understand how
they forced him to carry jesus cross
they forgot to stabilize my chair
they formed a women’s selfdefense organisation
they found it comforting to be reminded that after all they were truly their own masters and that the work they did was for their own benefit
they get smashed up and cut to pieces
they get up and go and have a look
they get up and go to see what’s happening
they get very worried
they got into the bus
they grudged no effort or sacrifice well aware that everything that they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them and not for a pack of idle thieving human beings
they had also dropped their championship of jones who had given up hope of getting his farm back and gone to live in another part of the county
they had also read what was written beneath the bird’s wing
they had been nervous about the effects upon their own animals or even upon their human employees
they had been warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary but had not believed that it would really happen
they had had a hard year and after the sale of part of the hay and corn the stores of food for the winter were none too plentiful but the windmill compensated for everything
they had just finished singing it for the third time when squealer attended by two dogs approached them with the air of having something important to say
they had just noticed this when a cry of despair broke from every animal’s throat
they had made their way on to the little knoll where the halffinished windmill stood and with one accord they all lay down as though huddling together for warmth  clover muriel benjamin the cows the sheep and a whole flock of geese and hens  everyone indeed except the cat who had suddenly disappeared just before napoleon ordered the animals to assemble
they had material comforts but they were always burdened by great sadness
they had never seen animals behave like this before and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose frightened them almost out of their wits
they had nicesounding names  flametree citronella ayapana pipik cardinal plateau belmont and the like
they had not been milked for twentyfour hours and their udders were almost bursting
they had nothing to go upon except squealers lists of figures which invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better
they had only one child who had died of an overdose
they had started the rebuilding of the windmill the day after the victory celebrations were ended
they had thought the fifth commandment was no animal shall drink alcohol but there were two words that they had forgotten
they had won but they were weary and bleeding
they have also chosen to decrease the taxes on the rich
they have been tested tested over and over again
they have got their police and army
they have kept a tight control on investment in what they refer to as “labour” meaning one of the inputs into production

they hide behind the counter terrified
they include our island rodrigues
they intend to decrease the amount of severance allowance that the boss has to pay to dismiss a worker
they just talk of producing any old thing they don’t say what so long as it’s done cheaply
they keep bothering me with their stupid pond
they keep reappearing in more or less the same words or the stone form
they keep the good ones but throw the bad ones away
they kept close to napoleon
they knew that life nowadays was harsh and bare that they were often hungry and often cold and that they were usually working when they were not asleep
they knew that the lord was with him
they learn english very quickly and easily than their siblings did under the old englishmedium system
they left the money lying on the ground jumped on their horses and fled
they limped into the yard
they look sad too
they made fun of him and shouted
they make you believe it firmly when they tell you “your country is not africa mauritius is not x or y country because here we are democrats”
they make you believe that your ownership and his are the same thing
they make you believe that “private property” is a good thing just the same for everyone
they might faint on their way home
they might have a very different relationship to the bourgeoisie
they might have fractured
they name this “intellectual property rights” or “traderelated intellectual property rights” trips
they need only to be recorded and published for the world to acknowledge their beauty
they need property rights over what we call the means of production
they need to own their own factories
they only look after themselves
they placed them in front of jesus and he healed them all
they pretend that they think that kreol and bhojpuri are not good as the medium because they get the signal from politicians in power like you that this is what they must say to be in your good books
they pulled out all the money they had stolen and put it into a pile to divide it among themselves
they push the door open and it creaks errrrck
they put it about that the animals on the manor farm they insisted on calling it the manor farm they would not tolerate the name animal farm were perpetually fighting among themselves and were also rapidly starving to death
they put the sack down by the side of the road and went into the shop each one took his turn paying for a round of drinks
they quickly began to understand the need for solidarity with those experiencing hardship not because they felt the sudden need to be philanthropic but because it was the only way for them to save their lives
they raised pigs and grew manioc and sweet potatoes
they ran thus
they refuse
they replied seven small loaves of bread and a few little fish
they roll about on the soil and make one big mess
they run home quickly to show their parents
they rushed back and looked through the window again
they said it was an economic strategy based on local resources
they said lord save us we are going to drown
they said yes we can
they said yes we do
they sailed across the sea
they saw as they imagined their enemies in flight and they rushed after them in disorder
they saw that they were in danger of being surrounded
they say it does not bring luck
they say it means you have your little bit of land or a nice wristwatch or a good pair of glasses and that these are yours
they say our laws our constitution itself protect your right to enjoy private property
they say that they will decrease the “cost of separation” meaning a boss gets “separated” from his worker as if the sacking were a divorce
they say there is a small problem in sugar textiles is in difficulty but let’s leave all the other things in place
they say they are dissatisfied with the level of courses
they say “our textile sector is just not competitive enough we should move towards other competitive sectors it we should do something or something else”
they scratched their heads and thought
they simply could not keep their eyes open
they slept on the deck
they sought an alliance for the working class with a section of the capitalist class against the imperialists for their plan for a “national reconstruction” project
they start to play on the weigh scale
they started this experiment in 1993 or 10 years ago
they suggested that the two of us work with them as assitant managers
they surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland the hayfield the orchard the pool the spinney
they swing on it
they talked a little
they tell you to do all this and then say “this is what democracy is”
they tell you you are living in a democratic country
they tell you “you’ve got democratic rights”
they themselves will judge you
they think god likes to hear long prayers
they thought my health had gotten worse
they tiptoed from room to room afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kind of awe at the unbelievable luxury at the beds with their feather mattresses the lookingglasses the horsehair sofa the brussels carpet the lithograph of queen victoria over the drawingroom mantelpiece
they tiptoed up to the house and such animals as were tall enough peered in at the diningroom window
they told him he will be born in bethlehem just as the prophet wrote
they told the chief priests everything that had happened
they too were slaughtered
they took refuge in the farm buildings and peeped cautiously out from chinks and knotholes
they took their exercise in the garden and were discouraged from playing with the other young animals
they unlike us have the right to own a sugar estate
they want all workers to be “multiskilled”
they want help in choosing a wife
they want to buy presents for their families
they want to choose where to build a house
they want to destroy all sectors that they qualify as “inefficient”
they want to do well in business
they want to find out who is doing harm to them
they want to “eliminate” small planters for example and thus risk losing all the alreadyacquired knowledge possessed by them and passed from generation to generation sustaining humans on the planet
they wanted to use it as a graveyard for foreigners
they went up on a very high mountain where they could be alone
they were able to see
they were all carrying sticks except jones who was marching ahead with a gun in his hands obviously they were going to attempt the recapture of the farm
they were all shouting
they were always cold and usually hungry as well
they were basic but adequate
they were executed immediately and fresh precautions for napoleons safety were taken
they were fine upstanding beasts willing workers and good comrades but very stupid
they were generally hungry they slept on straw they drank from the pool they laboured in the fields in winter they were troubled by the cold and in summer by the flies
they were glad to believe so
they were going to knock the windmill down
they were in a boat mending their nets
they were just coming down the stairs when mollie was discovered to be missing
they were just getting their clutches ready for the spring sitting and they protested that to take the eggs away now was murder
they were just too strong
they were keeping watch from the corner of the kitchen
they were put forward just before war was declared at a time when the fascist movement in germany and in spain was causing such terrible destruction to the workers’ movements and organizations that eventually the working class movements in these countries were crushed physically through killings assassinations imprisonment and these defeats were the precursor to wwii
they were screaming all night and we could not sleep
they were shaken and miserable
they were shown all over the farm and expressed great admiration for everything they saw especially the windmill
they were so delighted with the song that they sang it right through five times in succession and might have continued singing it all night if they had not been interrupted
they were still the only farm in the whole county in all england owned and operated by animals
they were struck dumb with surprise when napoleon announced that he had sold the pile of timber to frederick
they were terrified and started screaming
they were the same four pigs as had protested when napoleon abolished the sunday meetings
they were too attached to their sugar
they were unfailing in their attendance at the secret meetings in the barn and led the singing of beasts of england with which the meetings always ended
they were unnecessary he said and wasted time
they will also have eternal life
they will be like the angels in heaven
they will beat him and nail him to a cross
they will certainly be torn down
they will cry and grit their teeth in pain
they will even try to fool gods chosen ones
they will go on changing their mercedes every year or two
they will go to the seaside
they will know
they will look and look but never see
they will only produce gmos that will be resistant to their herbicides
they will say they are a worker who has understood things
they will see me there
they will soon make the son of man suffer in the same way
they will switch also among different customs and traditions
they wont let me take my bottle of water on the plane
they work from 1 o’clock to 7 o’clock
they would meet in the publichouses and prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down or that if it did stand up then that it would never work
theyre 5 for 2
theyre fixing the bus right now
theyre normal price
theyre taking you to your death

this accommodation allowed the sugar oligarchy to continue exercising its hegemony in the postindependence period
this again seems to be a simple fact but it is very important for workers workers’ organizations and trade unions to realize this simple fact
this agreement was amended twice
this agreement was included into the “sugar protocol” under the lome convention in 1974 when britain jointed the european economic community
this also means that it will encourage people to use more herbicides and pesticides and thus we will consume more herbicides and pesticides
this and that
this arrangement would have worked well enough if it had not been for the disputes between snowball and napoleon
this award is a form of recognition of the contribution of women in lpt
this award is the recognition for our persistent and constant work in the use of mother languages in adult literacy
this award represents an international recognition for the work done by lpt for 28 years

this budget certainly contains one big bit of “creative accounting” as they call it these days
this budget for the first time reveals the consequences of capitalist globalisation to the people of mauritius
this camera is on sale
this can create a lot of employment and keep our islands’ ecologies balanced
this can lead to a major shift in the allocation of labour forces within capitalism as different industrial sectors get reorganized to come out of the crisis period
this can of coke is warm
this can risk endangering the ecological balance by killing species of insects and plants
this change will also permit parents to contribute to the education of their child
this colour matches the car well
this committee submitted a new report by mid2013
this convention ratified by states including the mauritian state in 1990 assures children the right to education and the freedom to seek receive and spread information and ideas orally and in written and printed form without any discrimination
this corner is no corner at all
this correspond to unesco campaign education for all
this cup is dirty

this doesn’t mean they must always be practiced
this double crisis is something that has been lurking around for the past 20 years and everybody knew it was coming
this external support dates back to the period of pre1810 french colonization and to the apartheid era respectively
this farm which he had the honour to control was a cooperative enterprise
this field manual is a tool of such retrieval
this field manual tries to tell what will be found but you should take every chance to think up questions of your own which you base on the questions here
this further fueled the controversy
this girl acted by selfdefence when she killed her aggressor
this girl will marry this girl
this gives us an understanding of the internal configuration of the bourgeoisie as a class as well as the relationship it has with other sections of society
this group also wanted to accumulate capital
this had long been expected and all preparations had been made
this has greatly contributed to discouraging people from working in agriculture
this hat is on sale
this he said contained the essential principle of animalism
this idea is itself a bit of folklore
this idea itself would be worthy of study
this idea that folklore is dying out is one of the commonest folk ideas everywhere
this implies communicating your program making it known in working class milieus amongst workers and the poor until the entire country knows what your positions are what you are demanding why you demanding it and how the demands will lead to genuine solutions to the crises in society
this in turn endangers through crosspollination seeds that small planters have been using for years
this includes both the riddles games and amusements they learn from each other and the stories and proverbs in educating the young
this increased their output so fast that they became “hungry” for cane this means the estates had a vested interest in small planters supplying cane to keep their mills running
this is a demand that has been won in many capitalist countries in the world in britain italy france germany
this is a good computer
this is a midwife’s story
this is a realm where people like to participate in each other’s traditions
this is a too big work
this is affecting the entire mauritian economy
this is an advantage because it increases the value of one waste product and makes it become useful replacing the need for fertilizers which cost money pollute the earth and water and can be harmful for the flora and the fauna
this is an important exercise for the party to undertake
this is as ram seegobin points out a direct result of changes in government regulations designed to give them such windfall gains
this is because of your policy to force children to learn these languages subtractively ie at the cost of the mother tongue rather than additively ie in addition to the mother tongue
this is because the sithanen budget exposes the cruel face of the capitalist system
this is because there is a whole range of implications for strategy
this is called a sin
this is called “sustainable agricultural production”
this is due to the fact that the wto is mainly responsible for the bankrupting of small planters not only in india but also in latin america in france small planters in their association uniting peasants together with josé bové have for years already been reacting to the consequences of globalisation as they have felt them
this is for the same tshirt with depreciation
this is forcing the capitalists and the government in power to take decisions to reorganize the mauritian economy
this is going to be easy
this is important when we are organizing on the grounds of an organic crisis we need to gauge the tempo and the synchronization of that crisis
this is independent of their written status the number of people who speak them whether they are spoken or sign languages or any other factor whatsoever
this is jesus the king of the jews
this is my body
this is my daughter
this is my friend
this is my husband
this is my son
this is my wife

this is not a good idea
this is not going to be easy
this is of course the type of demagogy we expect from a parliamentary opposition like the mmm
this is of course true because people from different backgrounds have learned to participate in each other’s traditions
this is probably one of the insinuations prime minister ramgoolam intends when he reminds the private sector spokesmen mr de navacelle that mauritius “isn’t a colony any more”
this is something
this is supposed to increase growth
this is the aim of a program of demands
this is the bone of a deer
this is the first and most important commandment
this is the good news about jesus christ the son of god
this is the historical problematic that we have to deal with in this context
this is the important thing about crises like the one we are facing you unlike the bosses lose all your rights
this is the process that takes the most time in struggles
this is the type of slogan that in fact gave the government its clear electoral victories
this is very important
this is what actually happened
this is what counts
this is what democracy is all about they say
this is what folklore means in this book a form of communication which all people engage in
this is what is called highlevel bilingualism
this is what ram seegobin was explaining just before me how they want you to bear the entire brunt of a crisis which is of their making it is a crisis in their system
this is what the budget is in fact doing
this is what the law and the prophets are all about
this is why i have come
this is why i refer to this budget as containing a huge accountancy trick
this is why in india for example where there is a huge peasantry millions of small planters to give an idea of the scale one small farmers’ association has 10000000 members once gmo seeds under the control of multinational corporations were introduced many planters were completely ruined and as we have learnt thousands of farmers have been reduced to selling one of their kidneys just so that they can buy seeds to plant for their next harvest
this is why it is so important that all past experience is accumulated and that workers coming into the mobilization for the first time keep in mind all that’s happened in past struggles
this is why marde can plant his garden so beautifully
this is why the vegetables in this garden grow up looking so beautiful
this is why the very way that you organize the demands in a transitional program the way you present them is special
this is why these shocks have brought are bringing and will go on bringing all sorts of problems
this is why you also must be ready
this isnt the car i reserved online
this isnt trouble dear no trouble at all
this job is not well done
this kind of crisis has dangerous social repercussions in addition to the obvious economic effects
this kind of export processing zone was doomed from its very inception to be a nonsustainable type of socalled “development” it was always a “stopgap”
this kind of production like in china or mauritius can be done on a large scale or can be done through the link between different projects small planters and cattle breeders cooperating in the same process
this kind of research should become conversant with the agroindustrial sector instead of the main objective of commercialization of product in short run
this kind of “isolationism” was not on and at the time lalit criticized their plans as nationalist in the extreme
this kindle is used to read ebooks
this leads us to pose the question what is to be done in a situation like this
this letter is to explain to you in detail the harm that you are causing to children in mauritius
this letter is to explain to you that everywhere in the world all linguists and all human rights activists agree with us when we accuse you of the crime of linguistic genocide
this list has been adapted from the classic work on the subject
this made me unhappy in class
this magnet will be perfect for my collection
this makes a great gift
this makes it look at least for the moment as if it is heading for a bonapartist form of government
this makes the regime feel it doesn’t need to concede to this pressure or any pressure from the masses of the people
this manual can be used by anyone who can read and write
this manual is a set of directions for the collecting of folklore in mauritius
this meal is fantastic my compliments to the chef
this means cutting out any controls and rules that slow down business
this means he is decreasing company tax so that the companies become more profitable
this means i can write
this means identifying who is in government who is in which party from the pmsd to the mr we have to analyze the whole lot of them
this means if we understand governments position that an education of a religious specificity is dispensed
this means in order to get a wage increase you will have to produce more
this means that their contribution toward agricultural and economic development is absent and thus our overall production of ideas is impoverished
this means that these very bureaucracies and political nominees have always been colluding with the bosses and government in attacking jobs and in threatening the future of the people of the country as a whole
this means that we the people of the planet could be under the direct control of the big multinationals registered in the united states and which want to make profit through registering patents on life seeds and animals and where our food security will be endangered
this means that you intend to continue pretending though unesco has informed you of the contrary that you are unaware of the harm that school is doing to every child because of an erroneous policy on the use of the medium of education
this means they will also sell more of their different kinds of poison
this means we believe that the debate should not be limited to the question of the selling price of what is a “factor of production” for some consumers and a mere “commodity” for others
this means we need an analysis of the entire political scene what parties there are analyzing the mmm whose trajectory we’ve understood only too well labour party and also the other parties like mouvement republicain mr and other left organizations like muvman premye me
this mobile phone makes a nice gift
this morning i saw you looking over the hedge that divides animal farm from foxwood
this new government is now extending the scope of the irs
this offer was a gift from god for me
this one
this one doesn’t have horns
this one have been put into printed form which has probably made it better known ramdoyal 1979 17
this paper doesn’t aim to give any sort of global analysis of the content of the budget

this pillow is hard
this prize is called the international reading association literacy award
this prize will be awarded on 8th september 2004 on the occasion of the world literacy day
this process cannot be reversed because these plants will keep these genetic manipulations forever
this process must be reversed now and the ceb bureaucracy replaced by a democratic structure
this proficiency in the traditions of different groups has served people throughout mauritian history as a means of adaptation to new circumstances
this project if you look at it closely will transform médine from being a sugar company it’ll keep it’s cane of course into a real estate company now it will make its profits through land transactions and through land conversion
this racquet is inexpensive
this realization is something that has to be reached collectively if you are to win gains in your interests
this region has no inhabitant
this reminds us of how dholl puri sellers were driven away from portlouis by the authorities at the exact time when macdonalds was opening its fast food there
this restaurant is too noisy im looking for somewhere more quiet
this road is too dangerous
this robe is cheap
this room is too noisy
this rug looks old
this same capitalist class has kept a monopoly control over most of the land deciding all by themselves what to plant and how to organize production
this scarf is on sale
this scheme  having collectors all over the country sending materials to a central archive — is based on the folklore achievements of the small nation of ireland which has a valuable lesson to teach
this seat wont fold back
this shared understanding must be conscious
this should be a single sentence hypothesis which you will probably revise later
this shows how cooperation and integrated development can develop a new agricultural system
this single farm of ours would support a dozen horses twenty cows hundreds of sheep and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that are now almost beyond our imagining
this skirt is too short
this soon wakened the lion who placed his huge paw upon him and opened his big jaws to swallow him
this story is very boring
this story will show you what the kingdom of heaven is like
this study showed that the longer the mother tongue was used the better the child performed academically
this support is what gives the appearance that sugar and cane are “the best thing” for “mauritius” to be investing in
this sword will be perfect for my collection
this system brings the land ownership question into focus
this technology is even used on tractors
this time
this time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept over them like hail
this time two mice climb on a broom that’s hanging up in the air
this tooth is aching
this tshirt is too big
this ultraliberal option is what sithanen and the social alliance in power have chosen
this understanding must be shared
this unesco position is based on scientific research by expert pedagogues of international repute
this vase is on sale
this very morning we begin rebuilding the windmill and we will build all through the winter rain or shine
this was a sign of a cycle of sustained crisis in the social structure
this was a wickedness far outdoing snowball’s destruction of the windmill
this was early in march
this was just what snowball had intended
this was more than the hungry animals could bear
this was of the highest importance for the welfare of the farm squealer said
this was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse garden every sunday morning
this was sung every sunday morning after the hoisting of the flag
this was the old irs concept on the mmmmsm model
this was to be the name of the farm from now onwards
this was upsetting but inevitable
this was what came of rebelling against the laws of nature frederick and pilkington said
this watch is not working well
this way life could go on as if everything was normal
this way mauritius can become a world leader in food production which is guaranteed gmofree
this way mauritius can get around the disaster that the sugar industry is facing as the sugar protocol runs out
this way they also say and i’ve mentioned this before that they will be also helping smes
this way when there is no work in the factory when say orders have dropped they can send you out to sweep the yard
this will also be an important aspect of today’s theoretical seminar
this will also promote real estate speculation land transactions and a lot of shady deals
this will create employment and absorb the shock of the ruinous globalization that the multinationals are subjecting us to
this will create employment and at the same time protect mauritius’ natural heritage
this will create employment and can decrease the perilous effect of globalization that is threatening every country in the world
this will create employment as well as decrease pollution
this will create employment on a large scale and at the same time respect mauritius’ natural heritage
this will in turn make the prisons even less manageable than they already
this work is not easy
this work is too long
this work of popularizing your program from the very moment when you put it forward is totally different from the way parties like the mmm and labour proceed their leaders just stand up on a lorry give a speech and the people are left to stand and listen applaud and cheer and set off firecrackers
this work was strictly voluntary but any animal who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half
this would keep employment stable and bring food security this would have created the basis in turn for the development of a modern economy
this would light the stalls and warm them in winter and would also run a circular saw a chaffcutter a mangelslicer and an electric milking machine
this year is a good year for us
this “value added” only from an accountant’s point of view because nothing new has been produced

those who learnt through the mother tongue until the 6th standard did much better than the other two groups even in the english language itself the children not only caught up with the anglophone children but tended to do better than them
those who promote gmos are saying that its quality and quantity will increase that it will be more resistant to bacteria parasites and climatic conditions
those who tried to resist would discover that the banks had canceled their mortgage that their children had been expelled for disorderly conduct or that the canal that brought water to their crops had been blocked up
though it is the words which are memorable and therefore which should be written down exactly it is the situation in which the proverb is aid that should be observed most carefully

through
through generations of heroic struggles against colonization and through the struggle for independence we have gained a number of constitutional rights
through mobilization that involves action by the workers themselves on the basis of their demands that respond to today’s pressing problems and at the same time show you that your interests will not be taken care of or even maintained without addressing the biggest of all problems that workers have
through this award unesco also wanted to draw world attention on the necessity to produce written materials in mother languages
through this process the organism will produce new proteins which will give them new functions
throughout
throughout the one year they worked a sixtyhour week and in august napoleon announced that there would be work on sunday afternoons as well
throughout the whole period of his seeming friendship with pilkington napoleon had really been in secret agreement with frederick

thus
thus another topic is changes in this event over time
thus it is necessary to think on a new politics for the supply of energy
thus mauritius will be able to deal with the disaster of the sugar industry faced with the dismantling of the sugar protocol and at the same time be the avantgarde of a “gmofree guarantee” food producer
thus members of some mauritian groups are linked by their languages
thus they will control each stage in the food production chain

to mould
to move in
to my mind this explains a great deal comrades
to organize a formal state visit on the trochetia ship to diego garcia and the whole of chagos which is part of mauritian territory defined as such by the constitution and that the state delegation should include the president of the republic the prime minister and the leader of the opposition
to provoke
to rama sithanen that is just a “cost of separation” to his boss
to rebuild the windmill with walls twice as thick as before and to finish it by the appointed date together with the regular work of the farm was a tremendous labour
to run away
to see him toiling up the slope inch by inch his breath coming fast the tips of his hoofs clawing at the ground and his great sides matted with sweat filled everyone with admiration
to start
to syringe
to tell a story properly should other people be performing along with the storyteller
to tell you the truth i had been looking forward to my retirement
to that horror we all must come cows pigs hens sheep everyone
to the left
to understand the question of “what is to be done” we should start from an initial point of departure something which sounds very simple but is very important we should start from the reality of daily life in a capitalist society which means starting with all the complexity of the way in which the capitalist system is organized and the way in which a procapitalist government acts so that it manages to control society
to use all other un bodies and procedures possible for actions that indicate a clear statement of mauritian sovereignty over chagos and that expose the danger the military base represents
to what extent and by what ways does the change show the influence of other communities in mauritius
to what extent and in what ways are people participating or making use of other people‘s traditions

today if you have so many years service the boss has to give you notice of one month two months or three months before sacking you government is changing this
today is not the beginning of this work
today itself sunday 25th june 2006 in the weekend newspaper there is an interview of lindsey collen in which she talks about the budget globally
today khadija is about sixtyfive and farouk sixty
today life starts again
today mauritius is not one of the countries where labour is as cheap as in others
today my talk won’t be a blowbyblow commentary on each of the 12 demands that lalit put forward
today there is no basis for believing that mauritian culture is hybrid or deteriorated or degenerate
today this unesco award is saying that lpt was right in maintaining this basic pedagogical principle that every person learns better in his or her mother language no expert in education would say the contrary on this matter
today unesco is recognising the contribution of lpt in the production publication and circulation of every kind of literature in the kreol and bhojpuri languages
today we are being proven right
today we begin the hay harvest
today we can see both sugar and the textile industry struggling in something like death throes
today whatever the mmm says it can say the exact opposite at the same time without batting an eyelid
today you are announcing the construction of schools all over the country which is a good thing and you are imposing compulsory education while at the same time continuing the measure of forcing a foreign medium on kreolophone and bhojpuri phone pupils

we
we all know about the times of the  “sugar boom” in the mid 1970’s which quickly became the economic crisis of the late 1970’s when the revenue from sugar was no longer enough to assure the cost of imports of basic needs and when there were two devaluations which aimed at making workers and ordinary people bear the brunt of the crisis
we all know what that means
we all remember the notorious 57 million rupee “tax relief” that the first mmmpsm government introduced
we all worried about only one thing
we also accuse certain high up officers at the ministry and at the mie and some academics at the university of having a fawning attitude towards you as minister of education
we are born we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty
we are building our house
we are campaigning for labourers and artisans who are laid off to be given land to plant on
we are campaigning for unemployment benefit
we are campaigning so that foreign exchange gets taken out of the hands of the private sector because they have been using their recent access to foreign exchange so as to intentionally provoke depreciation in the value of the rupee thus raking in money and thus also causing the prices everyone pays for everyday goods to go up
we are campaigning so that the compensation money for the fall in the price of sugar that europe is offering to pay is put to good use what is being done with that money is it just going to the sugar estate bosses for them to sack workers is it going to be used to develop new work sectors
we are developing this kind of political program that aims at this real change that is to say a socialist change
we are fed up with governments which act as facilitators for these capitalists who are making profits
we are formally making an appeal to you to stop making children suffer the severe mental harm that is provoked by the constant insinuation in schools that childrens mother tongues are inferior are of no use or are not real languages
we are going to arrest him
we are known for being obstinate on this issue and we are still like that
we are not ready ready
we are writing because maybe you dont know about the genocidal effects of your policies
we are writing this letter to you about the medium used in schools
we call on government to get out of the rut of a ‘sugar authority’ and to break away from its obsession with sugar an obsession which seems to blind them and to think big for once
we can be mistaken for indigestion or heartburn
we can bet
we can say that there is still racism but objectively the idea that it was impossible to conceive of capitalism in south africa without the juridical form of apartheid was obviously with hindsight quite wrong
we can see here how the state is underwriting the infrastructure of the small producer in the face of the impending crisis  and i think that people in mauritius have commented on the absurdities of this arrangement whereby the state is going to pay money to bring into cane cultivation more land to derock these areas and all other kinds of actions kind
we can tell it because you talk like someone from galilee
we cant find the platform that our train leaves from
we cant put it in the temple treasury
we can’t just say it’s because there’s a police force and the riot police that can charge against us with teargas and “batons”
we commit ourselves to putting pressure on the mauritian state towards its acting in practice so as
we could land on europa
we dedicate this award to
we did not know all this
we did not solve the problem
we didnt take anything from the bar
we do not know how it will evolve
we do not light a lamp and put it under a bucket
we dont need any more witnesses
we dug the earth
we find again that sometimes it takes years of organizing in schools and universities and suddenly there’s a spark and we find that we cannot keep up – with the demands for literature demands for speakers and so on
we find that within a lot of working class forces like trade unions they imagine that it is just enough to have a list of demands without spelling out a strategy for their realization
we found a bone
we found out that it can
we had a slide show and talk series called “disik ki lavenir” that was touring towns and villages of mauritius
we had agreed to put up a show for the benefit of others but we had an understanding
we had become good friends and i was the one on whose shoulder she cried
we had prepared a slide show and talk series called “disik ki lavenir” that was touring towns and villages of mauritius
we had the support of a group of backers so we were able to lower prices until our competitors buckled
we had thought that snowball’s rebellion was caused simply by his vanity and ambition
we had to depend on our own strengths
we had to reinvent our future redraw the contours of a new tomorrow
we have a section on all this research later in this open letter
we have already heard the budget speech in the national assembly it has been examined in the “committee stage” it’s been voted
we have budweiser miller and rolling rock in bottles
we have built the walls far too thick for that
we have learnt a lot of things in this conference
we have no means of making sugar on this farm
we have removed the sheets from the farmhouse beds and sleep between blankets
we have the advantage of being a nation of islands so that we can be free from “contamination par les ogm”
we have to be conscious of their real role not just what they say they are doing
we have to be very vigilant
we have to catch up
we have to look at why it is that despite the fact that people see it is an unacceptable budget and even before the presentation of the budget when people knew they were becoming poorer and poorer despite the fact that many workers are being sacked despite many factory closures over the past 2 or 3 years despite so many people loosing their jobs in the sugar industry despite all the suffering due to price rises why is it that despite all this people are not saying “let’s go and take power these ministers don’t know how to govern”
we have to organise the farmers artisans and fishermen into coops which they run
we have to remember that the mmm won a byelection controlled all the municipalities in mauritius and in the 1976 general election it won 34 seats out of 70 in parliament almost half of parliament
we have to try and make clear who does this program speak to
we have you booked in room nunber 300
we hope that these three brief testimonies will help you and your advisors understand the gravity of your error minister sir
we hope that you will immediately start a process to put a stop to the persistence of these colonial policies which have gone on too long
we know sithanen used to work as an accountant for the rogers company that was not so long ago involved in the big scandal with air mauritius and we know that that type of company knows about accountancy tricks
we know that the biggest fight in the russian revolution was fought within the central committee of the bolshevik party
we live in a three bedroom apartment
we made long faces
we might be led to believe that it is a “containable” crisis as sithanen clearly believes it is when he says that in two or three years’ time everything will be just fine
we might take what seems a relatively manageable example of a complex observance the haldi ceremony the night before a hindu weddings
we must also closely analyze the politics the labour party has systematically followed for the past 15 years making sure we do not only look at what they said in public meetings and during electoral campaigns
we must also evidently put into question the very logic of capitalist globalization
we must analyze the labour party’s trajectory and take a hard look at its propaganda since the general elections to see whether labour will be continuing to protect the downtrodden as it says it is doing
we must analyze them and evaluate their potential whether to help or hinder the workers’ struggle
we must claim our rights on our economic zone around all the islands of our republic including chagos and tromelin
we must concentrate
we must get help at once said clover
we must know how to lift it up
we must look at the labour party’s membership and where it comes from
we must look for a safer place
we must make a separation between “official and “unofficial or popular
we must move towards a collective control and ownership of land
we must not hesitate
we must now convince other organizations the trade unions and associations to join us in our campaign because it has become a lifeordeath struggle for ordinary people
we must pay the shopkeeper
we must plant trees
we must remove him from the group
we must stress that this law is in conflict with the united nations convention on biodiversity called ‘fao concept of farmers’ rights’ which points to the necessity of the “precautionary principle” which allows the concerned parties to refuse to produce and commercialize gmos as long as it has not been proven to be harmless to health
we must use already acquired knowledge and experience
we need an ambulance
we need an “optimal land utilization authority” instead of a “sugar authority” which is obsolete
we need people like that
we need to oppose any new wto “round” and put off the ancient wto agreement till a “worldwide audit”
we need to think big
we need to understand a fundamental point that it is not through violence that the bosses and capitalists control you or that government controls you
we need to understand that many people are angry
we need to validate this
we note that the labour government has like the msm before it favoured the “eastern option” for its preferred source of foreign investment and for its challenges against the historic bourgeoisie which continues to rely on french and south african capital as it beats off the challenge
we note that you had announced that you would decide about the use of mother tongue in school after consulting unesco
we played the flute but you did not dance
we propose that government create a department for the study of the kreol language and another department for the study of bhojpuri at the university mie mca mes
we propose that the minister of education offers kreol and bhojpuri language as a subject as from when children go to primary school
we propose that the minister of education organizes a series of national translation competitions for all the textbooks used government must offer prizes of rs 100000 or more to the teacher who does the best translation of each text into kreol and bhojpuri
we propose that the ministry of education once and for all begins to use the mother tongue of children kreol and bhojpuri as the medium of education
we read the same results from a study by the guatemala national program for bilingual education children taught in their mother tongue have a better performance in all subjects including second language learning
we saw that in the august 1979 strike
we say it’s beautiful
we say that your department is by the following policies and practices giving the clear and harmful signal that kreol and bhojpurispeaking childrens language is inferior
we see a whole group within the party which kind of believes that once the first wave of the crisis breaks out it’s a oneway street now and the party is on the offensive all the time
we should always bear in mind that it is not government or the boss who out of their generosity give us things
we should analyze all the political actors all the political movements all the political organizations and all the trade union organizations
we should be able to have the necessary political mean to demand to ask for more democracy
we should not befuddle our understanding of presentday history driven as it is by economic and class forces by handicapping ourselves through wearing like racehorses “race blinkers”
we should not lose sight of the fact that through the irs projects the sugar industry is being given the chance to convert its agricultural land into residential property
we shouldn’t forget that although we are running this campaign here against sithanen’s budget and against the local bourgeoisie the struggle we are embarked on goes beyond this
we suppose the mcb and other banks just went and announced bad debts of rs 800000000 for each economic disaster

we the undersigned
we too were “developing”
we used to call them “mazanbik”
we used to go wherever we pleased
we were a handful of people who had great hope that tomorrow would be better
we were a small group likeminded in our aims and activities
we were all firm in our resolve no to give up one inch of our land
we were even then proposing a legal framework that would oblige the sugar estates to plant their rows of cane in a format that allows interline cropping of food crops every year and not just when there is new cane planted every seven or so years

we will build another windmill
we will build six windmills if we feel like it

we will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily
we will watch the film
we wish to assure you that we in ledikasyon pu travayer will continue the fight for the liberation of children from the domination you are continuing to impose on them
we won 50 seats
we would like to point out that kreol and bhojpuri incidentally are amongst the big languages of the planet
we would like you to take this letter as a formal notice that your language policy is harming children

you must not be afraid
you must not believe all this crap
you must not drink and smoke
you must not drive on like that when you see people at the bus stop
you must show him the way
you must speak
you must take up your cross and follow me
you must think well
you need an economy that creates jobs and that gives a guarantee that everyone has a job and a house and a certain standard of living

you received without paying now give without being paid
you saw the formation of the south african students’ organisation saso as one of the important landmarks the students organisation which organised in the tertiary institutions

you will not really be the one speaking
you wont have anything to worry about
you wont see me again until you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord
you won’t be able to travel
you won’t win demands that are against the political strategy of your adversaries if you allow the government and the bosses to win during the course of these confrontations
you would better tell your cook to pluck a hen
you would often hear one hen remark to another under the guidance of our leader comrade napoleon i have laid five eggs in six days or two cows enjoying a drink at the pool would exclaim thanks to the leadership of comrade napoleon how excellent this water tastes

your accurate observation of present practice can then be used for comparison with what history and anthropology tell us about practices in the ancestral land
your actions make you act against the spirit of both the constitution and the international conventions adhered to by mauritius and of course you continue to harm generations of children generations of peoples
your department must also begin to show a little respect for the science of linguistics which has for over fifty years now proven that kreol and bhojpuri are the equals of any other language
your department therefore doesnt provide education only to parents who choose to send their children to school now but actually compels parents to send their children to school failing which you can bring criminal charges against them
your eyes are like a lamp for your body
your faith has made it happen
your father knows what you need before you ask
your fax is illegible
your first quality should be patience
your heart will always be where your treasure is
your help is precious indeed but it doesn’t help us stand on our own feet
your job what do you do
your king is coming to you
your knowledge of your own folklore will help when you are ready to question others
your notes and observations can be sent in to the future archiveor to the department of folklore at the mahatma gandhi institutejust as you have written them or in more finished form
your predecessors did nothing about this  with the notable exception of mr kadress pillay who in the first draft of his plan did address the issue but later capitulated
your school system m obeegadoo is continuing making our children demilingual
your second quality should be absolute faithfulness to what people say and do
your son will be a great servant of the lord
your words show what is in your hearts
your worst enemies will be in your own family
