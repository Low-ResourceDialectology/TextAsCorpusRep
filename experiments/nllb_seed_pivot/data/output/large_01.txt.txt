0001: Lillian Diana Gish (October 14, 1893 – February 27, 1993) was an American actress, director and screenwriter.
0002: Gish was a prominent film star from 1912 into the 1920s, being particularly associated with the films of director D. W. Griffith.
0003: She also did considerable television work from the early 1950s into the 1980s, and closed her career playing opposite Bette Davis in the 1987 film The Whales of August.
0004: The first several generations of Gishes were Dunkard ministers.
0005: Their mother opened the Majestic Candy Kitchen, and the girls helped sell popcorn and candy to patrons of the old Majestic Theater, located next door.
0006: The seventeen-year-old Lillian traveled to Shawnee, Oklahoma, where James's brother Alfred Grant Gish and his wife, Maude, lived.
0007: In cartography, a map projection is a way to flatten a globe's surface into a plane in order to make a map.
0008: Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions are acceptable and others are not; therefore, different map projections exist in order to preserve some properties of the sphere-like body at the expense of other properties.
0009: Projections are a subject of several pure mathematical fields, including differential geometry, projective geometry, and manifolds.
0010: Rather, any mathematical function that transforms coordinates from the curved surface distinctly and smoothly to the plane is a projection.
0011: The Earth and other large celestial bodies are generally better modeled as oblate spheroids, whereas small objects such as asteroids often have irregular shapes.
0012: Because the curved Earth's surface is not isometric to a plane, preservation of shapes inevitably leads to a variable scale and, consequently, non-proportional presentation of areas.
0013: "The School of ""Minor-talks"", which was not a unique school of thought, but a philosophy constructed of all the thoughts which were discussed by and originated from normal people on the street."
0014: Confucianism was particularly strong during the Han Dynasty, whose greatest thinker was Dong Zhongshu, who integrated Confucianism with the thoughts of the Zhongshu School and the theory of the Five Elements.
0015: In particular, they refuted the assumption of Confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage, but simply a human and mortal.
0016: Buddhism arrived in China around the 1st century AD, but it was not until the Northern and Southern, Sui and Tang Dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement.
0017: This leads to the inquiry into the one being that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things.
0018: Seven Rishis — Atri, Bharadwaja, Gautama, Jamadagni, Kasyapa, Vasishtha, Viswamitra.
0019: The humanities generally study local traditions, through their history, literature, music, and arts, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras.
0020: Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.
0021: "The word anthropos (άνθρωπος) is from the Greek word for ""human being"" or ""person""."
0022: This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem.
0023: The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs.
0024: Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities.
0025: In perfectly competitive markets, no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product.
0026: Microeconomics studies individual markets by simplifying the economic system by assuming that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets.
0027: General-equilibrium theory studies various markets and their behaviour.
0028: Choices must be made between desirable yet mutually exclusive actions.
0029: Part of the cost of making pretzels is that neither the flour nor the morning are available any longer, for use in some other way.
0030: Inputs used in the production process include such primary factors of production as labour services, capital (durable produced goods used in production, such as an existing factory), and land (including natural resources).
0031: Circulation in animals occur between two types of tissues: systemic tissues and breathing (or pulmonary) organs.
0032: In birds and mammals, the systemic and pulmonary systems are connected in series.
0033: Skeletal muscle contractions are neurogenic as they require synaptic input from motor neurons.
0034: The contraction produced can be described as a twitch, summation, or tetanus, depending on the frequency of action potentials.
0035: The mechanisms of contraction are similar in all three muscle tissues.
0036: Other animals such as mollusks, and nematodes, possess obliquely striated muscles, which contain bands of thick and thin filaments that are arranged helically rather than transversely, like in vertebrate skeletal or cardiac muscles.
0037: Focused ion beams can directly remove material, or even deposit material when suitable precursor gasses are applied at the same time.
0038: These could then be used as single-molecule components in a nanoelectronic device.
0039: Molecular nanotechnology is a proposed approach which involves manipulating single molecules in finely controlled, deterministic ways.
0040: There are hopes for applying nanorobots in medicine.
0041: Because of the discrete (i.e. atomic) nature of matter and the possibility of exponential growth, this stage is seen as the basis of another industrial revolution.
0042: With the decrease in dimensionality, an increase in surface-to-volume ratio is observed.
0043: The realization that some basic conception within the existing theory was at odds with reality necessitated a complete and thorough investigation of the axioms and assumptions that underlie that theory.
0044: "However, historian Carl Benjamin Boyer writes that ""such claims are not well substantiated and unlikely to be true""."
0045: Mathematicians like Brahmagupta (in 628 AD) and Bhāskara I (in 629 AD) made contributions in this area as did other mathematicians who followed.
0046: The year 1872 saw the publication of the theories of Karl Weierstrass (by his pupil Ernst Kossak), Eduard Heine (Crelle's Journal, 74), Georg Cantor (Annalen, 5), and Richard Dedekind.
0047: Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a cut (Schnitt) in the system of all rational numbers, separating them into two groups having certain characteristic properties.
0048: Dirichlet also added to the general theory, as have numerous contributors to the applications of the subject.
0049: Her father died in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1912, but she had returned to Ohio a few months before this.
0050: When Lillian and Dorothy were old enough they joined the theatre, often traveling separately in different productions.
0051: Gish continued to perform on the stage, and in 1913, during a run of A Good Little Devil, she collapsed from anemia.
0052: Her performance in these frigid conditions gave her lasting nerve damage in several fingers.
0053: He utilized her expressive talents to the fullest, developing her into a suffering yet strong heroine.
0054: She directed her sister Dorothy in one film, Remodeling Her Husband (1920), when D. W. Griffith took his unit on location.
0055: The purpose of the map determines which projection should form the base for the map.
0056: Data sets are geographic information; their collection depends on the chosen datum (model) of the Earth.
0057: Like Tissot's indicatrix, the Goldberg-Gott indicatrix is based on infinitesimals, and depicts flexion and skewness (bending and lopsidedness) distortions.
0058: Sometimes spherical triangles are used.
0059: Another way to visualize local distortion is through grayscale or color gradations whose shade represents the magnitude of the angular deformation or areal inflation.
0060: Because the Earth's actual shape is irregular, information is lost in this step.
0061: Ancient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BC, marking the end of the Greek Dark Ages.
0062: It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including astronomy, epistemology, mathematics, political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric and aesthetics.
0063: Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers to Roman philosophy, Early Islamic philosophy, Medieval Scholasticism, the European Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment.
0064: But they taught themselves to reason.
0065: "Thales inspired the Milesian school of philosophy and was followed by Anaximander, who argued that the substratum or arche could not be water or any of the classical elements but was instead something ""unlimited"" or ""indefinite"" (in Greek, the apeiron)."
0066: "Contrary to the Milesian school, which posits one stable element as the arche, Heraclitus taught that panta rhei (""everything flows""), the closest element to this eternal flux being fire."
0067: A good deal of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as Wittgenstein claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time.
0068: "It has been defined as a ""system of rules"", as an ""interpretive concept"" to achieve justice, as an ""authority"" to mediate people's interests, and even as ""the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction""."
0069: Laws are politics, because politicians create them.
0070: "As Immanuel Kant noted, ""Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three sciences: physics, ethics, and logic."")"
0071: Shinto, Daoism, and other folk or natural religions do not have ethical codes.
0072: Belief systems imply a logical model that religions do not display because of their internal contradictions, lack of evidence, and falsehoods. .
0073: "Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs, or in other words, the amount of ""waste"" is reduced."
0074: "In the simplest case an economy can produce just two goods (say ""guns"" and ""butter"")."
0075: Scarcity is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume beyond the PPF (such as at X) and by the negative slope of the curve.
0076: The slope of the curve at a point on it gives the trade-off between the two goods.
0077: Along the PPF, scarcity implies that choosing more of one good in the aggregate entails doing with less of the other good.
0078: A point inside the curve (as at A), is feasible but represents production inefficiency (wasteful use of inputs), in that output of one or both goods could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve.
0079: They can transmit or receive information at sites of contacts called synapses.
0080: Cells such as neurons or muscle cells may be excited or inhibited upon receiving a signal from another neuron.
0081: In vertebrates, the nervous system consists of the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which consists of nerves that connect the CNS to every other part of the body.
0082: The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems, the somatic, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems.
0083: The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy, while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state.
0084: Nerves that exit directly from the brain are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves.
0085: Although conceptually similar to the scanning confocal microscope developed by Marvin Minsky in 1961 and the scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) developed by Calvin Quate and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.
0086: However, this is still a slow process because of low scanning velocity of the microscope.
0087: Another group of nanotechnological techniques include those used for fabrication of nanotubes and nanowires, those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers.
0088: Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials.
0089: By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques.
0090: These techniques include chemical synthesis, self-assembly and positional assembly.
0091: This asserts that every integer has a unique factorization into primes.
0092: To show this, suppose we divide integers n by m (where m is nonzero).
0093: If 0 never occurs, then the algorithm can run at most m − 1 steps without using any remainder more than once.
0094: "In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting (as in ""there are six coins on the table"") and ordering (as in ""this is the third largest city in the country"")."
0095: These chains of extensions make the natural numbers canonically embedded (identified) in the other number systems.
0096: The first major advance in abstraction was the use of numerals to represent numbers.
0097: She turned down the money, requesting a more modest wage and a percentage so that the studio could use the funds to increase the quality of her films — hiring the best actors, screenwriters, etc.
0098: Many of the silent era's leading ladies, such as Gish and Pickford, had been wholesome and innocent, but by the early 1930s (after the full adoption of sound and before the Motion Picture Production Code was enforced) these roles were perceived as outdated.
0099: "Louis Mayer wanted to stage a scandal (""knock her off her pedestal"") to garner public sympathy for Gish, but Lillian didn't want to act both on screen and off, and returned to her first love, the theater."
0100: Returning to movies, Gish was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1946 for Duel in the Sun.
0101: She was considered for various roles in Gone with the Wind ranging from Ellen O'Hara, Scarlett's mother (which went to Barbara O'Neil), to prostitute Belle Watling (which went to Ona Munson).
0102: She appeared as Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna in the short-lived 1965 Broadway musical Anya.
0103: To compare, one cannot flatten an orange peel without tearing and warping it.)
0104: Tangent means the surface touches but does not slice through the globe; secant means the surface does slice through the globe.
0105: If these lines are a parallel of latitude, as in conical projections, it is called a standard parallel.
0106: This applies for any cylindrical or pseudocylindrical projection in normal aspect.
0107: Scale is constant along all straight lines radiating from a particular geographic location.
0108: Whether spherical or ellipsoidal, the principles discussed hold without loss of generality.
0109: Being, he argued, by definition implies eternality, while only that which is can be thought; a thing which is, moreover, cannot be more or less, and so the rarefaction and condensation of the Milesians is impossible regarding Being; lastly, as movement requires that something exist apart from the thing moving (viz.
0110: In support of this, Parmenides' pupil Zeno of Elea attempted to prove that the concept of motion was absurd and as such motion did not exist.
0111: Leucippus also proposed an ontological pluralism with a cosmogony based on two main elements: the vacuum and atoms.
0112: "While philosophy was an established pursuit prior to Socrates, Cicero credits him as ""the first who brought philosophy down from the heavens, placed it in cities, introduced it into families, and obliged it to examine into life and morals, and good and evil."""
0113: The fact that many conversations involving Socrates (as recounted by Plato and Xenophon) end without having reached a firm conclusion, or aporetically, has stimulated debate over the meaning of the Socratic method.
0114: Socrates taught that no one desires what is bad, and so if anyone does something that truly is bad, it must be unwillingly or out of ignorance; consequently, all virtue is knowledge.
0115: They are necessary for understanding the human predicament.
0116: The non-founder religions are Hinduism, Shinto, and native or folk religions.
0117: When traditional religions fail to address new concerns, then new religions will emerge.
0118: Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as songwriting and stagecraft.
0119: This is called Performance art.
0120: Dance is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (bee dance, mating dance), and motion in inanimate objects (the leaves danced in the wind).
0121: It has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs, including high-income countries.
0122: Among each of these production systems, there may be a corresponding division of labour with different work groups specializing, or correspondingly different types of capital equipment and differentiated land uses.
0123: Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market prices of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage, so that (relatively) low-cost inputs go to producing low-cost outputs.
0124: In microeconomics, it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition, which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power.
0125: Demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc.
0126: The law of demand states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related.
0127: In humans specifically, the major endocrine glands are the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands.
0128: Hormones can be amino acid complexes, steroids, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, or prostaglandins.
0129: They produce haploid gametes by meiosis.
0130: In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm, also develops between them.
0131: Gastrulation occurs, whereby morphogenetic movements convert the cell mass into a three germ layers that comprise the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.
0132: Cellular differentiation is influenced by extracellular signals such as growth factors that are exchanged to adjacent cells, which is called juxtracrine signaling, or to neighboring cells over short distances, which is called paracrine signaling.
0133: Researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories like John R. Arthur.
0134: MBE allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures.
0135: Bandages are being infused with silver nanoparticles to heal cuts faster.
0136: Nanotechnology may have the ability to make existing medical applications cheaper and easier to use in places like the general practitioner's office and at home.
0137: Platinum is currently used as the diesel engine catalyst in these engines.
0138: Next the oxidation catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water.
0139: This is just what Zeno sought to prove.
0140: In the minds of the Greeks, disproving the validity of one view did not necessarily prove the validity of another, and therefore further investigation had to occur.
0141: A magnitude “...was not a number but stood for entities such as line segments, angles, areas, volumes, and time which could vary, as we would say, continuously.
0142: Because no quantitative values were assigned to magnitudes, Eudoxus was then able to account for both commensurable and incommensurable ratios by defining a ratio in terms of its magnitude, and proportion as an equality between two ratios.
0143: This incommensurability is dealt with in Euclid's Elements, Book X, Proposition 9.
0144: In fact, in many cases algebraic conceptions were reformulated into geometric terms.
0145: She was interviewed in the television documentary series Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film (1980).
0146: She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1720 Vine Street.
0147: At the Cannes festival, Gish won a 10-minute standing ovation from the audience.
0148: "The episode ""Marry for Murder"" was broadcast on September 9, 1943."
0149: She was awarded an Academy Honorary Award in 1971, and in 1984 she received an AFI Life Achievement Award.
0150: The University awarded Gish the honorary degree of Doctor of Performing Arts the next day.
0151: Following Gish's 1993 death, the University raised funds to enlarge its gallery to display memorabilia received from Gish's estate.
0152: The association between herself and D. W. Griffith was so close that some suspected a romantic connection, an issue never acknowledged by Gish, although several of their associates were certain they were at least briefly involved.
0153: In the 1920s, Gish's association with Duell became something of a tabloid scandal when he sued her and made the details of their relationship public.
0154: George Jean Nathan praised Gish's acting glowingly—comparing her to Eleonora Duse.
0155: During the period of political turmoil in the US that lasted from the outbreak of World War II in Europe until the attack on Pearl Harbor, she maintained an outspoken non-interventionist stance.
0156: Joseph Frank Keaton (October 4, 1895 – February 1, 1966), known professionally as Buster Keaton, was an American actor, comedian, film director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer.
0157: The ellipsoidal model is commonly used to construct topographic maps and for other large- and medium-scale maps that need to accurately depict the land surface.
0158: Compared to the best fitting ellipsoid, a geoidal model would change the characterization of important properties such as distance, conformality and equivalence.
0159: For irregular planetary bodies such as asteroids, however, sometimes models analogous to the geoid are used to project maps from.
0160: The projections are described in terms of placing a gigantic surface in contact with the Earth, followed by an implied scaling operation.
0161: "Where the light source emanates along the line described in this last constraint is what yields the differences between the various ""natural"" cylindrical projections."
0162: This cylinder is wrapped around the Earth, projected onto, and then unrolled.
0163: "North-south distances neither stretched nor compressed (1): equirectangular projection or ""plate carrée""."
0164: Since this projection scales north-south distances by the reciprocal of east-west stretching, it preserves area at the expense of shapes.
0165: Other meridians are longer than the central meridian and bow outward, away from the central meridian.
0166: Therefore, meridians are equally spaced along a given parallel.
0167: The resulting conic map has low distortion in scale, shape, and area near those standard parallels.
0168: Can be constructed from a point of perspective an infinite distance from the tangent point; r(d) = c sin .	
0169: The great statesman Pericles was closely associated with this new learning and a friend of Anaxagoras, however, and his political opponents struck at him by taking advantage of a conservative reaction against the philosophers; it became a crime to investigate the things above the heavens or below the earth, subjects considered impious.
0170: Socrates, however, is the only subject recorded as charged under this law, convicted, and sentenced to death in 399 BCE (see Trial of Socrates).
0171: Plato casts Socrates as the main interlocutor in his dialogues, deriving from them the basis of Platonism (and by extension, Neoplatonism).
0172: Zeno of Citium in turn adapted the ethics of Cynicism to articulate Stoicism.
0173: Along with Xenophon, Plato is the primary source of information about Socrates' life and beliefs and it is not always easy to distinguish between the two.
0174: Although rule by a wise man would be preferable to rule by law, the wise cannot help but be judged by the unwise, and so in practice, rule by law is deemed necessary.
0175: Plato's dialogues also have metaphysical themes, the most famous of which is his theory of forms.
0176: It likens most humans to people tied up in a cave, who look only at shadows on the walls and have no other conception of reality.
0177: If these travelers then re-entered the cave, the people inside (who are still only familiar with the shadows) would not be equipped to believe reports of this 'outside world'.
0178: Bertrand Russell, A History of Western Philosophy (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1972).
0179: "He criticizes the regimes described in Plato's Republic and Laws, and refers to the theory of forms as ""empty words and poetic metaphors."""
0180: Antisthenes was inspired by the ascetism of Socrates, and accused Plato of pride and conceit.
0181: In Byzantine and Gothic art of the Middle Ages, the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths.
0182: A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon).
0183: It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface.
0184: However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with drawing, composition and other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner.
0185: Black is associated with mourning in the West, but elsewhere white may be.
0186: "The word ""red"", for example, can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum."
0187: This began with cubism and is not painting in strict sense.
0188: Consequently, many spend the first few years after graduation deciding what to do next, resulting in lower incomes at the start of their career; meanwhile, graduates from career-oriented programs experience more rapid entry into the labour market.
0189: However, the empirical evidence also shows that humanities graduates still earn notably higher incomes than workers with no postsecondary education, and have job satisfaction levels comparable to their peers from other fields.
0190: As a percentage of the type of degrees awarded, however, the humanities seem to be declining.
0191: Federal funding represents a much smaller fraction of funding for humanities than other fields such as STEM or medicine.
0192: This understanding, they claimed, ties like-minded people from similar cultural backgrounds together and provides a sense of cultural continuity with the philosophical past.
0193: In addition, purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy (the income effect).
0194: Supply is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price.
0195: Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged.
0196: Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement.
0197: Market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above.
0198: At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded.
0199: The most obvious kinds of firms are corporations, partnerships and trusts.
0200: In perfectly competitive markets studied in the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price.
0201: Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition, various forms of oligopoly, and monopoly.
0202: Given its different forms, there are various ways of representing uncertainty and modelling economic agents' responses to it.
0203: In behavioural economics, it has been used to model the strategies agents choose when interacting with others whose interests are at least partially adverse to their own.
0204: It has significant applications seemingly outside of economics in such diverse subjects as formulation of nuclear strategies, ethics, political science, and evolutionary biology.
0205: The adaptive immune system provides a tailored response to each stimulus by learning to recognize molecules it has previously encountered.
0206: Bacteria have a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against virus infections.
0207: Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt to recognize pathogens more efficiently.
0208: Fixed action patterns, for instance, are genetically determined and stereotyped behaviors that occur without learning.
0209: The community of living (biotic) organisms in conjunction with the nonliving (abiotic) components (e.g., water, light, radiation, temperature, humidity, atmosphere, acidity, and soil) of their environment is called an ecosystem.
0210: By feeding on plants and on one another, animals play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through the system.
0211: The Earth's physical environment is shaped by solar energy and topography.
0212: Weather is the day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the long-term average of weather, typically averaged over a period of 30 years.
0213: As a result, wet environments allow for lush vegetation to grow.
0214: Population growth during short-term intervals can be determined using the population growth rate equation, which takes into consideration birth, death, and immigration rates.
0215: A biological interaction is the effect that a pair of organisms living together in a community have on each other.
0216: A long-term interaction is called a symbiosis.
0217: Danish company InnovationsFonden invested DKK 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology.
0218: If the catalyst's surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized, efficiency of the catalyst is maximized.
0219: Thus, creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalyst—in turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumes—and will decrease cost.
0220: When designing scaffolds, researchers attempt to mimic the nanoscale features of a cell's microenvironment to direct its differentiation down a suitable lineage.
0221: TSMC began production of a 7 nm process in 2017, and Samsung began production of a 5 nm process in 2018.
0222: For these reasons, some groups advocate that nanotechnology be regulated by governments.
0223: Some nanoparticle products may have unintended consequences.
0224: Inhaling airborne nanoparticles and nanofibers may lead to a number of pulmonary diseases, e.g. fibrosis.
0225: "A major study published more recently in Nature Nanotechnology suggests some forms of carbon nanotubes – a poster child for the ""nanotechnology revolution"" – could be as harmful as asbestos if inhaled in sufficient quantities."
0226: Davies (2008) has proposed a regulatory road map describing steps to deal with these shortcomings.
0227: As a result, some academics have called for stricter application of the precautionary principle, with delayed marketing approval, enhanced labelling and additional safety data development requirements in relation to certain forms of nanotechnology.
0228: Nuclear technology is technology that involves the nuclear reactions of atomic nuclei.
0229: The use of imaginary numbers was not widely accepted until the work of Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855).
0230: The integers form the smallest group and the smallest ring containing the natural numbers.
0231: It is the prototype of all objects of such algebraic structure.
0232: Fixed length integer approximation data types (or subsets) are denoted int or Integer in several programming languages (such as Algol68, C, Java, Delphi, etc.).
0233: These are provable properties of rational numbers and positional number systems, and are not used as definitions in mathematics.
0234: Since the triangle is isosceles, a = b).
0235: Since c is even, dividing c by 2 yields an integer.
0236: Substituting 4y2 for c2 in the first equation (c2 = 2b2) gives us 4y2= 2b2.
0237: Since b2 is even, b must be even.
0238: However this contradicts the assumption that they have no common factors.
0239: Hippasus, however, was not lauded for his efforts: according to one legend, he made his discovery while out at sea, and was subsequently thrown overboard by his fellow Pythagoreans “…for having produced an element in the universe which denied the…doctrine that all phenomena in the universe can be reduced to whole numbers and their ratios.”
0240: For example, consider a line segment: this segment can be split in half, that half split in half, the half of the half in half, and so on.
0241: His career declined when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and lost his artistic independence.
0242: Many of Keaton's films from the 1920s remain highly regarded, such as Sherlock Jr. (1924), The General (1926), and The Cameraman (1928).
0243: "His father was Joseph Hallie ""Joe"" Keaton, who owned a traveling show with Harry Houdini called the Mohawk Indian Medicine Company, or the Keaton Houdini Medicine Show Company, which performed on stage and sold patent medicine on the side."
0244: In Keaton's retelling, he was six months old when the incident occurred, and Harry Houdini gave him the nickname.
0245: The act was mainly a comedy sketch.
0246: A suitcase handle was sewn into Keaton's clothing to aid with the constant tossing.
0247: However, Buster was always able to show the authorities that he had no bruises or broken bones.
0248: Several times I'd have been killed if I hadn't been able to land like a cat.
0249: Noticing that this caused the audience to laugh less, he adopted his famous deadpan expression when performing.
0250: Despite tangles with the law and a disastrous tour of music halls in the United Kingdom, Keaton was a rising star in the theater.
0251: "In February 1917, he met Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle at the Talmadge Studios in New York City, where Arbuckle was under contract to Joseph M. Schenck."
0252: Buster was such a natural in his first film, The Butcher Boy, he was hired on the spot.
0253: Keaton later claimed that he was soon Arbuckle's second director and his entire gag department.
0254: It was based on a successful play, The New Henrietta, which had already been filmed once, under the title The Lamb, with Douglas Fairbanks playing the lead.
0255: He made a series of two-reel comedies, including One Week (1920), The Playhouse (1921), Cops (1922), and The Electric House (1922).
0256: "Comedy director Leo McCarey, recalling the freewheeling days of making slapstick comedies, said, ""All of us tried to steal each other's gagmen."
0257: During the railroad water-tank scene in Sherlock Jr., Keaton broke his neck when a torrent of water fell on him from a water tower, but he did not realize it until years afterward.
0258: Keaton's character emerged unscathed, due to a single open window.
0259: Aside from Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928), Keaton's most enduring feature-length films include Our Hospitality (1923), The Navigator (1924), Sherlock Jr. (1924), Seven Chances (1925), The Cameraman (1928), and The General (1926).
0260: Though it would come to be regarded as Keaton's greatest achievement, the film received mixed reviews at the time.
0261: His distributor, United Artists, insisted on a production manager who monitored expenses and interfered with certain story elements.
0262: The actors would phonetically memorize the foreign-language scripts a few lines at a time and shoot immediately after.
0263: The director was usually Jules White, whose emphasis on slapstick and farce made most of these films resemble White's famous Three Stooges shorts.
0264: However, director White's insistence on blunt, violent gags resulted in the Columbia shorts being the least inventive comedies he made.
0265: He made his last starring feature El Moderno Barba Azul (1946) in Mexico; the film was a low-budget production, and it may not have been seen in the United States until its release on VHS in the 1980s, under the title Boom in the Moon.
0266: In In the Good Old Summertime, Keaton personally directed the stars Judy Garland and Van Johnson in their first scene together, where they bump into each other on the street.
0267: Reaction was strong enough for a local Los Angeles station to offer Keaton his own show, also broadcast live, in 1950.
0268: Buster Keaton's wife Eleanor also was seen in the series (notably as Juliet to Buster's Romeo in a little-theater vignette).
0269: Keaton's periodic television appearances during the 1950s and 1960s helped to revive interest in his silent films.
0270: Well into his fifties, Keaton successfully recreated his old routines, including one stunt in which he propped one foot onto a table, then swung the second foot up next to it and held the awkward position in midair for a moment before crashing to the stage floor.
0271: Near-sided perspective projection, which simulates the view from space at a finite distance and therefore shows less than a full hemisphere, such as used in The Blue Marble 2012).
0272: The special point or points may get stretched into a line or curve segment when projected.
0273: Azimuthal equidistant: Distances from the center and edge are preserved.
0274: Thus, many projections exist to serve the many uses of maps and their vast range of scales.
0275: Reference maps of the world often appear on compromise projections.
0276: The Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection presented by Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569.
0277: As a side effect, the Mercator projection inflates the size of objects away from the equator.
0278: However, given the geometry of a sundial, these maps may well have been based on the similar central cylindrical projection, a limiting case of the gnomonic projection, which is the basis for a sundial.
0279: However, this was a simple, and common, case of misidentification.
0280: "Mercator titled the map : ""A new and augmented description of Earth corrected for the use of sailors""."
0281: Various hypotheses have been tendered over the years, but in any case Mercator's friendship with Pedro Nunes and his access to the loxodromic tables Nunes created likely aided his efforts.
0282: However, the mathematics involved were developed but never published by mathematician Thomas Harriot starting around 1589.
0283: Two main problems prevented its immediate application: the impossibility of determining the longitude at sea with adequate accuracy and the fact that magnetic directions, instead of geographical directions, were used in navigation.
0284: However, it did not begin to dominate world maps until the 19th century, when the problem of position determination had been largely solved.
0285: Due to these pressures, publishers gradually reduced their use of the projection over the course of the 20th century.
0286: In accomplishing this, the unavoidable east–west stretching of the map, which increases as distance away from the equator increases, is accompanied in the Mercator projection by a corresponding north–south stretching, so that at every point location the east–west scale is the same as the north–south scale, making it a conformal map projection.
0287: At latitudes greater than 70° north or south the Mercator projection is practically unusable, because the linear scale becomes infinitely large at the poles.
0288: Ellesmere Island on the north of Canada's Arctic archipelago looks about the same size as Australia, although Australia is over 39 times as large.
0289: Greenland's real area is comparable to the Democratic Republic of the Congo's alone.
0290: Alaska appears to be the same size as Australia, although Australia is actually 4½ times as large.
0291: Sweden appears much larger than Madagascar.
0292: "A World Map on a Regular Icosahedron by Gnomonic Projection."""
0293: As a result of these criticisms, modern atlases no longer use the Mercator projection for world maps or for areas distant from the equator, preferring other cylindrical projections, or forms of equal-area projection.
0294: Arno Peters stirred controversy beginning in 1972 when he proposed what is now usually called the Gall–Peters projection to remedy the problems of the Mercator, claiming it to be his own original work without referencing prior work by cartographers such as Gall's work from 1855.
0295: The range for a amongst the possible choices is about 35 km, but for small scale (large region) applications this variation may be ignored, and mean values of 6,371 km and 40,030 km may be taken for the radius and circumference respectively.
0296: A cylindrical map projection is specified by formulae linking the geographic coordinates of latitude φ and longitude λ to Cartesian coordinates on the map with origin on the equator and x-axis along the equator.
0297: Since the cylinder is tangential to the globe at the equator, the scale factor between globe and cylinder is unity on the equator but nowhere else.
0298: The difference (λ − λ0) is in radians.
0299: Even more extreme truncations have been used: a Finnish school atlas was truncated at approximately 76°N and 56°S, an aspect ratio of 1.97.
0300: Narrower strips are better: sec 8° = 1.01, so a strip of width 16° (centred on the equator) is accurate to within 1% or 1 part in 100.
0301: It was founded by Euclides of Megara, one of the pupils of Socrates.
0302: Pyrrhonism places the attainment of ataraxia (a state of equanimity) as the way to achieve eudaimonia.
0303: "His ethics were based on ""the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain""."
0304: Their logical contributions still feature in contemporary propositional calculus.
0305: This skeptical period of ancient Platonism, from Arcesilaus to Philo of Larissa, became known as the New Academy, although some ancient authors added further subdivisions, such as a Middle Academy.
0306: While the objective of the Pyrrhonists was the attainment of ataraxia, after Arcesilaus the Academic skeptics did not hold up ataraxia as the central objective.
0307: In the Byzantine Empire Greek ideas were preserved and studied, and not long after the first major expansion of Islam, however, the Abbasid caliphs authorized the gathering of Greek manuscripts and hired translators to increase their prestige.
0308: Medieval philosophy is the philosophy that existed through the Middle Ages, the period roughly extending from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century to the Renaissance in the 15th century.
0309: With the possible exceptions of Avicenna and Averroes, medieval thinkers did not consider themselves philosophers at all: for them, the philosophers were the ancient pagan writers such as Plato and Aristotle.
0310: One of the most heavily debated things of the period was that of faith versus reason.
0311: It is generally agreed that it begins with Augustine (354–430) who strictly belongs to the classical period, and ends with the lasting revival of learning in the late eleventh century, at the beginning of the high medieval period.
0312: In later periods, monks were used for training administrators and churchmen.
0313: Much of the work of Aristotle was unknown in the West in this period.
0314: Augustine is regarded as the greatest of the Church Fathers.
0315: For over a thousand years, there was hardly a Latin work of theology or philosophy that did not quote his writing, or invoke his authority.
0316: He became consul in 510 in the kingdom of the Ostrogoths.
0317: He wrote commentaries on these works, and on the Isagoge by Porphyry (a commentary on the Categories).
0318: Around this period several doctrinal controversies emerged, such as the question of whether God had predestined some for salvation and some for damnation.
0319: Is the host the same as Christ's historical body?
0320: This period also witnessed a revival of scholarship.
0321: Later, under St. Abbo of Fleury (abbot 988–1004), head of the reformed abbey school, Fleury enjoyed a second golden age.
0322: The early 13th century witnessed the culmination of the recovery of Greek philosophy.
0323: Powerful Norman kings gathered men of knowledge from Italy and other areas into their courts as a sign of their prestige.
0324: The universities developed in the large cities of Europe during this period, and rival clerical orders within the Church began to battle for political and intellectual control over these centers of educational life.
0325: The great representatives of Dominican thinking in this period were Albertus Magnus and (especially) Thomas Aquinas, whose artful synthesis of Greek rationalism and Christian doctrine eventually came to define Catholic philosophy.
0326: "Aquinas showed how it was possible to incorporate much of the philosophy of Aristotle without falling into the ""errors"" of the Commentator Averroes."
0327: The problem of evil: The classical philosophers had speculated on the nature of evil, but the problem of how an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God could create a system of things in which evil exists first arose in the medieval period.
0328: However, from the fourteenth century onward, the increasing use of mathematical reasoning in natural philosophy prepared the way for the rise of science in the early modern period.
0329: In the earlier period, writers such as Peter Abelard wrote commentaries on the works of the Old logic (Aristotle's Categories, On interpretation, and the Isagoge of Porphyry).
0330: (The word 'intentionality' was revived by Franz Brentano, who was intending to reflect medieval usage).
0331: Apart from its societal application, narrative imagination is an important tool in the (re)production of understood meaning in history, culture and literature.
0332: Poststructuralism has problematized an approach to the humanistic study based on questions of meaning, intentionality, and authorship.
0333: Furthermore, critical thinking, while arguably a result of humanistic training, can be acquired in other contexts.
0334: Such pleasure contrasts with the increasing privatization of leisure and instant gratification characteristic of Western culture; it thus meets Jürgen Habermas' requirements for the disregard of social status and rational problematization of previously unquestioned areas necessary for an endeavor which takes place in the bourgeois public sphere.
0335: Despite many humanities based arguments against the humanities some within the exact sciences have called for their return.
0336: It’s good to know the history of philosophy.”
0337: "Communication (from Latin communicare, meaning ""to share""or ""to be in relation with"") is ""an apparent answer to the painful divisions between self and other, private and public, and inner thought and outer word."""
0338: Message composition (further internal or technical elaboration on what exactly to express).
0339: Noise sources such as natural forces and in some cases human activity (both intentional and accidental) begin influencing the quality of signals propagating from the sender to one or more receivers.
0340: Interpretation and making sense of the presumed original message.
0341: Examples of intent are voluntary, intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking, as well as involuntary, such as sweating.
0342: Likewise, written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, the spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion.
0343: Some of the functions of nonverbal communication in humans are to complement and illustrate, to reinforce and emphasize, to replace and substitute, to control and regulate, and to contradict the denotative message.
0344: To have total communication, all non-verbal channels such as the body, face, voice, appearance, touch, distance, timing, and other environmental forces must be engaged during face-to-face interaction.
0345: """Non-verbal behaviours may form a universal language system."""
0346: Language learning normally occurs most intensively during human childhood.
0347: Constructed languages such as Esperanto, programming languages, and various mathematical formalisms are not necessarily restricted to the properties shared by human languages.
0348: The properties of language are governed by rules.
0349: Contrary to popular belief, signed languages of the world (e.g., American Sign Language) are considered to be verbal communication because their sign vocabulary, grammar, and other linguistic structures abide by all the necessary classifications as spoken languages.
0350: Communication is thus a process by which meaning is assigned and conveyed in an attempt to create shared understanding.
0351: A channel, to which signals are adapted for transmission.
0352: A destination, where the message arrives.
0353: No allowance for differing purposes.
0354: No allowance for situational contexts.
0355: These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication.
0356: Syntactic (formal properties of signs and symbols).
0357: In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (2008) proposed a transactional model of communication.
0358: This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted.
0359: The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.
0360: Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.
0361: It also analyses the pricing of financial instruments, the financial structure of companies, the efficiency and fragility of financial markets, financial crises, and related government policy or regulation.
0362: "Customers without knowledge of whether a car is a ""lemon"" depress its price below what a quality second-hand car would be."
0363: "Both problems may raise insurance costs and reduce efficiency by driving otherwise willing transactors from the market (""incomplete markets"")."
0364: Information asymmetries and incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies, as discussed above.
0365: Public goods are goods which are under-supplied in a typical market.
0366: For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.).
0367: In many areas, some form of price stickiness is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side.
0368: Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from perfect competition.
0369: Such aggregates include national income and output, the unemployment rate, and price inflation and subaggregates like total consumption and investment spending and their components.
0370: This has addressed a long-standing concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject.
0371: Keynes contended that aggregate demand for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns, leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of potential output.
0372: New classical macroeconomics, as distinct from the Keynesian view of the business cycle, posits market clearing with imperfect information.
0373: The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs.
0374: Classical models of unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers.
0375: Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand.
0376: Money has general acceptability, relative consistency in value, divisibility, durability, portability, elasticity in supply, and longevity with mass public confidence.
0377: "In the words of Francis Amasa Walker, a well-known 19th-century economist, ""Money is what money does"" (""Money is that money does"" in the original)."
0378: Its economic function can be contrasted with barter (non-monetary exchange).
0379: When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy, there is an output gap where some productive capacity is left unemployed.
0380: For example, unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways.
0381: The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by crowding out.
0382: Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.
0383: The latter, an aspect of public choice theory, models public-sector behaviour analogously to microeconomics, involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats.
0384: It also concerns the size and distribution of gains from trade.
0385: "It is often stated that Carlyle gave economics the nickname ""the dismal science"" as a response to the late 18th century writings of The Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus, who grimly predicted that starvation would result, as projected population growth exceeded the rate of increase in the food supply."
0386: The close relation of economic theory and practice with politics is a focus of contention that may shade or distort the most unpretentious original tenets of economics, and is often confused with specific social agendas and value systems.
0387: Some academic economic journals have increased their efforts to gauge the consensus of economists regarding certain policy issues in hopes of effecting a more informed political environment.
0388: Issues like central bank independence, central bank policies and rhetoric in central bank governors discourse or the premises of macroeconomic policies (monetary and fiscal policy) of the state, are focus of contention and criticism.
0389: The field of information economics includes both mathematical-economical research and also behavioural economics, akin to studies in behavioural psychology, and confounding factors to the neoclassical assumptions are the subject of substantial study in many areas of economics.
0390: "Joskow had a strong feeling that the important work in oligopoly was done through informal observations while formal models were ""trotted out ex post""."
0391: There are different trophic levels within any food web, with the lowest level being the primary producers (or autotrophs) such as plants and algae that convert energy and inorganic material into organic compounds, which can then be used by the rest of the community.
0392: And those that eat secondary consumers are tertiary consumers and so on.
0393: In some cycles there are reservoirs where a substance remains or is sequestered for a long period of time.
0394: The largest driver of warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, of which more than 90% are carbon dioxide and methane.
0395: Biodiversity affects the functioning of ecosystems, which provide a variety of services upon which people depend.
0396: Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress.
0397: Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance.
0398: These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants.
0399: In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of molecular genetic analysis, including genomics and proteomics and DNA sequences to classify plants more accurately.
0400: "Modern botany traces its roots back to Ancient Greece specifically to Theophrastus (c. 371–287 BCE), a student of Aristotle who invented and described many of its principles and is widely regarded in the scientific community as the ""Father of Botany""."
0401: De Materia Medica was widely read for more than 1,500 years.
0402: In the mid-16th century, botanical gardens were founded in a number of Italian universities.
0403: They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject.
0404: Throughout this period, botany remained firmly subordinate to medicine.
0405: Bock created his own system of plant classification.
0406: The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or more closely related to the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys.
0407: This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus.
0408: Increasing knowledge of plant anatomy, morphology and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus.
0409: The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy is still a major foundation of modern botany.
0410: The concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate broadleaf forest changes by a process of ecological succession was developed by Henry Chandler Cowles, Arthur Tansley and Frederic Clements.
0411: The discovery and identification of the auxin plant hormones by Kenneth V. Thimann in 1948 enabled regulation of plant growth by externally applied chemicals.
0412: 20th century developments in plant biochemistry have been driven by modern techniques of organic chemical analysis, such as spectroscopy, chromatography and electrophoresis.
0413: These technologies enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in bioreactors to synthesise pesticides, antibiotics or other pharmaceuticals, as well as the practical application of genetically modified crops designed for traits such as improved yield.
0414: Modern systematics aims to reflect and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants.
0415: As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration.
0416: Historically, all living things were classified as either animals or plants and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered animals.
0417: "The strictest definition of ""plant"" includes only the ""land plants"" or embryophytes, which include seed plants (gymnosperms, including the pines, and flowering plants) and the free-sporing cryptogams including ferns, clubmosses, liverworts, hornworts and mosses."
0418: The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, known as the gametophyte, nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for at least part of its life, even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte.
0419: Palaeobotanists study ancient plants in the fossil record to provide information about the evolutionary history of plants.
0420: This is what ecologists call the first trophic level.
0421: He, Pierre Curie and Marie Curie began investigating the phenomenon.
0422: Some of these kinds of radiation could pass through ordinary matter, and all of them could be harmful in large amounts.
0423: Gradually it was realized that the radiation produced by radioactive decay was ionizing radiation, and that even quantities too small to burn could pose a severe long-term hazard.
0424: As the atom came to be better understood, the nature of radioactivity became clearer.
0425: Alpha decay is when a nucleus releases an alpha particle, which is two protons and two neutrons, equivalent to a helium nucleus.
0426: This type of radiation is the most dangerous and most difficult to block.
0427: The average number of neutrons released per nucleus that go on to fission another nucleus is referred to as k. Values of k larger than 1 mean that the fission reaction is releasing more neutrons than it absorbs, and therefore is referred to as a self-sustaining chain reaction.
0428: If there are enough immediate decays to carry on the chain reaction, the mass is said to be prompt critical, and the energy release will grow rapidly and uncontrollably, usually leading to an explosion.
0429: During the project, the first fission reactors were developed as well, though they were primarily for weapons manufacture and did not generate electricity.
0430: However, if the mass is critical only when the delayed neutrons are included, then the reaction can be controlled, for example by the introduction or removal of neutron absorbers.
0431: When the resulting nucleus is lighter than that of iron, energy is normally released; when the nucleus is heavier than that of iron, energy is generally absorbed.
0432: The remaining abundance of heavy elements, from nickel to uranium and beyond, is due to supernova nucleosynthesis, the R-process.
0433: Hydrogen bombs obtain their enormous destructive power from fusion, but their energy cannot be controlled.
0434: However, both of these devices operate at a net energy loss.
0435: Nuclear fusion was initially pursued only in theoretical stages during World War II, when scientists on the Manhattan Project (led by Edward Teller) investigated it as a method to build a bomb.
0436: Even small nuclear devices can devastate a city by blast, fire and radiation.
0437: Such a weapon must hold one or more subcritical fissile masses stable for deployment, then induce criticality (create a critical mass) for detonation.
0438: One isotope of uranium, namely uranium-235, is naturally occurring and sufficiently unstable, but it is always found mixed with the more stable isotope uranium-238.
0439: Alternatively, the element plutonium possesses an isotope that is sufficiently unstable for this process to be usable.
0440: "They detonated the first nuclear weapon in a test code-named ""Trinity"", near Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945."
0441: In the wake of unprecedented devastation and casualties from a single weapon, the Japanese government soon surrendered, ending World War II.
0442: Just over four years later, on August 29, 1949, the Soviet Union detonated its first fission weapon.
0443: A radiological weapons is a type of nuclear weapon designed to distribute hazardous nuclear material in enemy areas.
0444: While considered useless by a conventional military, such a weapon raises concerns over nuclear terrorism.
0445: The treaty permitted underground nuclear testing.
0446: After signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996 (which had as of 2011 not entered into force), all of these states have pledged to discontinue all nuclear testing.
0447: Throughout the Cold War, the opposing powers had huge nuclear arsenals, sufficient to kill hundreds of millions of people.
0448: Currently nuclear power provides approximately 15.7% of the world's electricity (in 2004) and is used to propel aircraft carriers, icebreakers and submarines (so far economics and fears in some ports have prevented the use of nuclear power in transport ships).
0449: Medical and dental x-ray imagers use of cobalt-60 or other x-ray sources.
0450: Both contain a small source of 241Am that gives rise to a small constant current.
0451: But the next major advance in the theory was made by Georg Cantor; in 1895 he published a book about his new set theory, introducing, among other things, transfinite numbers and formulating the continuum hypothesis.
0452: "A modern geometrical version of infinity is given by projective geometry, which introduces ""ideal points at infinity"", one for each spatial direction."
0453: The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in Wallis's De algebra tractatus.
0454: In 240 BC, Eratosthenes used the Sieve of Eratosthenes to quickly isolate prime numbers.
0455: Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the Goldbach conjecture, which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes.
0456: Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with 1 (0 was not even considered a number for the Ancient Greeks.)
0457: In this base 10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a place value of 1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.
0458: Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a minus sign).
0459: Here the letter Z comes .
0460: Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to 1 and can also be positive, negative, or 0.
0461: The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers.
0462: Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one-tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02.
0463: Not only these prominent examples but almost all real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral.
0464: Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not significant.
0465: For example, 0.999..., 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number 1.
0466: Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place.
0467: Thus the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers.
0468: The fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that the complex numbers form an algebraically closed field, meaning that every polynomial with complex coefficients has a root in the complex numbers.
0469: The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered.
0470: Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers.
0471: The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a polynomial, and thus form a real closed field that contains the real algebraic numbers.
0472: One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers.
0473: The number system that results depends on what base is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a prime number base provides the best mathematical properties.
0474: The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size.
0475: This standard basis makes the complex numbers a Cartesian plane, called the complex plane.
0476: The complex numbers of absolute value one form the unit circle.
0477: In domain coloring the output dimensions are represented by color and brightness, respectively.
0478: Work on the problem of general polynomials ultimately led to the fundamental theorem of algebra, which shows that with complex numbers, a solution exists to every polynomial equation of degree one or higher.
0479: Wessel's memoir appeared in the Proceedings of the Copenhagen Academy but went largely unnoticed.
0480: Later classical writers on the general theory include Richard Dedekind, Otto Hölder, Felix Klein, Henri Poincaré, Hermann Schwarz, Karl Weierstrass and many others.
