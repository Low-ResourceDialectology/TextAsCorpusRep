0001: Lillian Diana Gish (October 14, 1893 – February 27, 1993) was an American actress, director and screenwriter.
0002: Gish was a prominent film star from 1912 into the 1920s, being particularly associated with the films of director D. W. Griffith.
0003: She also did considerable television work from the early 1950s into the 1980s, and closed her career playing opposite Bette Davis in the 1987 film The Whales of August.
0004: The first several generations of Gishes were Dunkard ministers.
0005: Their mother opened the Majestic Candy Kitchen, and the girls helped sell popcorn and candy to patrons of the old Majestic Theater, located next door.
0006: The seventeen-year-old Lillian traveled to Shawnee, Oklahoma, where James's brother Alfred Grant Gish and his wife, Maude, lived.
0007: An example of multi-sited ethnography is Nancy Scheper-Hughes' work on the international black market for the trade of human organs.
0008: Research in kinship studies often crosses over into different anthropological subfields including medical, feminist, and public anthropology.
0009: That is the matrix into which human children are born in the great majority of cases, and their first words are often kinship terms.
0010: There are stark differences between communities in terms of marital practice and value, leaving much room for anthropological fieldwork.
0011: The marital practice found in most cultures, however, is monogamy, where one woman is married to one man.
0012: There are similar foundational differences where the act of procreation is concerned.
0013: Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor.
0014: The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to.
0015: Genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below – fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.
0016: Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants.
0017: Although humans have always been interested in the natural history of the animals they saw around them, and made use of this knowledge to domesticate certain species, the formal study of zoology can be said to have originated with Aristotle.
0018: Modern zoology has its origins during the Renaissance and early modern period, with Carl Linnaeus, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Robert Hooke, Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel and many others.
0019: Observations of the large-scale structure of the Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos.
0020: A hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in the mass density of space.
0021: Gravitational aggregations clustered into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps.
0022: Various fields of physics are crucial to studying the universe.
0023: Finally, the latter is important for the understanding of the large-scale structure of the cosmos.
0024: As the name suggests, an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an ellipse.
0025: The first genetically modified ornamentals commercialized altered color.
0026: Other genetically modified ornamentals include Chrysanthemum and Petunia.
0027: The papaya ringspot virus devastated papaya trees in Hawaii in the twentieth century until transgenic papaya plants were given pathogen-derived resistance.
0028: The second generation of crops aimed to improve the quality, often by altering the nutrient profile.
0029: GM crops contribute by improving harvests through reducing insect pressure, increasing nutrient value and tolerating different abiotic stresses.
0030: The majority of GM crops have been modified to be resistant to selected herbicides, usually a glyphosate or glufosinate based one.
0031: Such a weapon must hold one or more subcritical fissile masses stable for deployment, then induce criticality (create a critical mass) for detonation.
0032: One isotope of uranium, namely uranium-235, is naturally occurring and sufficiently unstable, but it is always found mixed with the more stable isotope uranium-238.
0033: Alternatively, the element plutonium possesses an isotope that is sufficiently unstable for this process to be usable.
0034: They detonated the first nuclear weapon in a test code-named "Trinity", near Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945.
0035: In the wake of unprecedented devastation and casualties from a single weapon, the Japanese government soon surrendered, ending World War II.
0036: Just over four years later, on August 29, 1949, the Soviet Union detonated its first fission weapon.
0037: It can also be understood as the free market idea applied to international trade.
0038: The most outspoken critic of the church in France was François Marie Arouet de Voltaire, a representative figure of the enlightenment.
0039: My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out."
0040: Locke stood to refute Sir Robert Filmer's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system.
0041: Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin, Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa.
0042: Though one could be worried about restrictions on liberty by benevolent monarchs or aristocrats, the traditional worry is that when rulers are politically unaccountable to the governed they will rule in their own interests, rather than the interests of the governed.
0043: But the next major advance in the theory was made by Georg Cantor; in 1895 he published a book about his new set theory, introducing, among other things, transfinite numbers and formulating the continuum hypothesis.
0044: A modern geometrical version of infinity is given by projective geometry, which introduces "ideal points at infinity", one for each spatial direction.
0045: The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in Wallis's De algebra tractatus.
0046: In 240 BC, Eratosthenes used the Sieve of Eratosthenes to quickly isolate prime numbers.
0047: Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the Goldbach conjecture, which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes.
0048: Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with 1 (0 was not even considered a number for the Ancient Greeks.)
0049: Her father died in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1912, but she had returned to Ohio a few months before this.
0050: When Lillian and Dorothy were old enough they joined the theatre, often traveling separately in different productions.
0051: Gish continued to perform on the stage, and in 1913, during a run of A Good Little Devil, she collapsed from anemia.
0052: Her performance in these frigid conditions gave her lasting nerve damage in several fingers.
0053: He utilized her expressive talents to the fullest, developing her into a suffering yet strong heroine.
0054: She directed her sister Dorothy in one film, Remodeling Her Husband (1920), when D. W. Griffith took his unit on location.
0055: The shift can be traced back to the 1960s, with the reassessment of kinship's basic principles offered by Edmund Leach, Rodney Neeham, David Schneider, and others.
0056: This shift was progressed further by the emergence of second-wave feminism in the early 1970s, which introduced ideas of marital oppression, sexual autonomy, and domestic subordination.
0057: At this time, there was the arrival of "Third World feminism", a movement that argued kinship studies could not examine the gender relations of developing countries in isolation, and must pay respect to racial and economic nuance as well.
0058: In Jamaica, marriage as an institution is often substituted for a series of partners, as poor women cannot rely on regular financial contributions in a climate of economic instability.
0059: With this technology, questions of kinship have emerged over the difference between biological and genetic relatedness, as gestational surrogates can provide a biological environment for the embryo while the genetic ties remain with a third party.
0060: There have also been issues of reproductive tourism and bodily commodification, as individuals seek economic security through hormonal stimulation and egg harvesting, which are potentially harmful procedures.
0061: There are cave paintings, engravings and sculptures in France dating back 15,000 years showing bison, horses and deer in carefully rendered detail.
0062: Ancient knowledge of wildlife is illustrated by the realistic depictions of wild and domestic animals in the Near East, Mesopotamia and Egypt, including husbandry practices and techniques, hunting and fishing.
0063: Aristotle, in the fourth century BC, looked at animals as living organisms, studying their structure, development and vital phenomena.
0064: Four hundred years later, Roman physician Galen dissected animals to study their anatomy and the function of the different parts, because the dissection of human cadavers was prohibited at the time.
0065: In Europe, Galen's work on anatomy remained largely unsurpassed and unchallenged up until the 16th century.
0066: Having previously been the realm of gentlemen naturalists, over the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, zoology became an increasingly professional scientific discipline.
0067: Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.
0068: Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars.
0069: About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.
0070: A radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas.
0071: The large-scale structure of the cosmos is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies.
0072: In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center.
0073: A few use the genes that encode for vegetative insecticidal proteins.
0074: Less than one percent of GM crops contained other traits, which include providing virus resistance, delaying senescence and altering the plants composition.
0075: Plants and plant cells have been genetically engineered for production of biopharmaceuticals in bioreactors, a process known as pharming.
0076: Many drugs also contain natural plant ingredients and the pathways that lead to their production have been genetically altered or transferred to other plant species to produce greater volume.
0077: They also pose less risk of being contaminated.
0078: Vaccines are expensive to produce, transport, and administer, so having a system that could produce them locally would allow greater access to poorer and developing areas.
0079: A radiological weapons is a type of nuclear weapon designed to distribute hazardous nuclear material in enemy areas.
0080: While considered useless by a conventional military, such a weapon raises concerns over nuclear terrorism.
0081: The treaty permitted underground nuclear testing.
0082: After signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996 (which had as of 2011 not entered into force), all of these states have pledged to discontinue all nuclear testing.
0083: Throughout the Cold War, the opposing powers had huge nuclear arsenals, sufficient to kill hundreds of millions of people.
0084: Currently nuclear power provides approximately 15.7% of the world's electricity (in 2004) and is used to propel aircraft carriers, icebreakers and submarines (so far economics and fears in some ports have prevented the use of nuclear power in transport ships).
0085: Justice involves duties that are perfect duties—that is, duties that are correlated with rights.
0086: He uses, On Liberty to discuss gender equality in society.
0087: The Liberty of the Ancients was participatory republican liberty, which gave the citizens the right to directly influence politics through debates and votes in the public assembly.
0088: Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous societies, in which the people could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairs.
0089: Instead, the voters would elect representatives, who would deliberate in Parliament on behalf of the people and would save citizens from the necessity of daily political involvement.
0090: In Leviathan, Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of states and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality.
0091: In this base 10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a place value of 1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.
0092: Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a minus sign).
0093: Here the letter Z comes .
0094: Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to 1 and can also be positive, negative, or 0.
0095: The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers.
0096: Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one-tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02.
0097: She turned down the money, requesting a more modest wage and a percentage so that the studio could use the funds to increase the quality of her films — hiring the best actors, screenwriters, etc.
0098: Many of the silent era's leading ladies, such as Gish and Pickford, had been wholesome and innocent, but by the early 1930s (after the full adoption of sound and before the Motion Picture Production Code was enforced) these roles were perceived as outdated.
0099: Louis Mayer wanted to stage a scandal ("knock her off her pedestal") to garner public sympathy for Gish, but Lillian didn't want to act both on screen and off, and returned to her first love, the theater.
0100: Returning to movies, Gish was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1946 for Duel in the Sun.
0101: She was considered for various roles in Gone with the Wind ranging from Ellen O'Hara, Scarlett's mother (which went to Barbara O'Neil), to prostitute Belle Watling (which went to Ona Munson).
0102: She appeared as Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna in the short-lived 1965 Broadway musical Anya.
0103: One critique is that, as its inception, the framework of kinship studies was far too structured and formulaic, relying on dense language and stringent rules.
0104: Much of this development can be attributed to the rise in anthropologists working outside of academia and the increasing importance of globalization in both institutions and the field of anthropology.
0105: The two types of institutions defined in the field of anthropology are total institutions and social institutions.
0106: Anthropology of institutions may analyze labor unions, businesses ranging from small enterprises to corporations, government, medical organizations, education, prisons, and financial institutions.
0107: Institutional anthropologists may study the relationship between organizations or between an organization and other parts of society.
0108: More specifically, anthropologists may analyze specific events within an institution, perform semiotic investigations, or analyze the mechanisms by which knowledge and culture are organized and dispersed.
0109: These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection; in this Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by explaining the processes by which it can occur, and providing observational evidence that it had done so.
0110: Darwin gave a new direction to morphology and physiology, by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution.
0111: An early necessity was to identify the organisms and group them according to their characteristics, differences and relationships, and this is the field of the taxonomist.
0112: His ideas were centered on the morphology of animals.
0113: These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the Darwinian principle of common descent.
0114: Homo is the genus, and sapiens the specific epithet, both of them combined make up the species name.
0115: The disk is surrounded by a spheroid halo of older, population II stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters.
0116: These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.
0117: These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way.
0118: 7–18 Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds.
0119: Almost all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were created inside the cores of stars.
0120: Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to evolve.
0121: Being stored in plants reduces the long-term cost as they can be disseminated without the need for cold storage, don't need to be purified, and have long term stability.
0122: As of 2018 only three genetically modified animals have been approved, all in the USA.
0123: Canada: Brainwaving The first transgenic mammals were produced by injecting viral DNA into embryos and then implanting the embryos in females.
0124: The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system as a cheap and fast way of directly modifying germ cells, effectively halving the amount of time needed to develop genetically modified mammals.
0125: Genetically modified mice have been the most common mammals used in biomedical research, as they are cheap and easy to manipulate.
0126: In 2009, scientists announced that they had successfully transferred a gene into a primate species (marmosets) for the first time.
0127: Medical and dental x-ray imagers use of cobalt-60 or other x-ray sources.
0128: Both contain a small source of 241Am that gives rise to a small constant current.
0129: Another use in insect control is the sterile insect technique, where male insects are sterilized by radiation and released, so they have no offspring, to reduce the population.
0130: The radiation sources used include radioisotope gamma ray sources, X-ray generators and electron accelerators.
0131: As such it is also used on non-food items, such as medical hardware, plastics, tubes for gas-pipelines, hoses for floor-heating, shrink-foils for food packaging, automobile parts, wires and cables (isolation), tires, and even gemstones.
0132: Microorganisms can no longer proliferate and continue their malignant or pathogenic activities.
0133: In that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the world.
0134: Published in 1762, it became one of the most influential works of political philosophy in the Western tradition.
0135: Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they."
0136: The industrial revolution produced a parallel revolution in political thought.
0137: In the mid-19th century, Marxism was developed, and socialism in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class.
0138: Unlike Marx who believed in historical materialism, Hegel believed in the Phenomenology of Spirit.
0139: Not only these prominent examples but almost all real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral.
0140: Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not significant.
0141: For example, 0.999..., 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number 1.
0142: Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place.
0143: Thus the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers.
0144: The fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that the complex numbers form an algebraically closed field, meaning that every polynomial with complex coefficients has a root in the complex numbers.
0145: She was interviewed in the television documentary series Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film (1980).
0146: She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1720 Vine Street.
0147: At the Cannes festival, Gish won a 10-minute standing ovation from the audience.
0148: The episode "Marry for Murder" was broadcast on September 9, 1943.
0149: She was awarded an Academy Honorary Award in 1971, and in 1984 she received an AFI Life Achievement Award.
0150: The University awarded Gish the honorary degree of Doctor of Performing Arts the next day.
0151: This new era would involve many new technological developments, such as mechanical recording.
0152: Current Anthropology 43(Supplement):S5-17.Schieffelin, Bambi B. 2006.
0153: Woolard, in her overview of "code switching", or the systematic practice of alternating linguistic varieties within a conversation or even a single utterance, finds the underlying question anthropologists ask of the practice—Why do they do that?—reflects a dominant linguistic ideology.
0154: Other linguists have carried out research in the areas of language contact, language endangerment, and 'English as a global language'.
0155: The work of Joel Kuipers develops this theme vis-a-vis the island of Sumba, Indonesia.
0156: He feels, in fact, that the exemplary center idea is one of linguistic anthropology's three most important findings.
0157: The dominant classification system is called the Linnaean taxonomy.
0158: Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences.
0159: It focuses on how organs and organ systems work together in the bodies of humans and animals, in addition to how they work independently.
0160: Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant physiology and animal physiology, but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular organism is being studied.
0161: For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular organisms such as mammalogy, ornithology, herpetology, or entomology, but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.
0162: Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection.
0163: The ejection of the outer layers forms a planetary nebula.
0164: This is an 11-year oscillation in sunspot number.
0165: The Sun has also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant impact on the Earth.
0166: Above this layer is a thin region known as the chromosphere.
0167: Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation.
0168: A solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the Sun until, at the outermost limit of the Solar System, it reaches the heliopause.
0169: Stable expression has been accomplished in sheep, pigs, rats and other animals.
0170: Human alpha-1-antitrypsin is another protein that has been produced from goats and is used in treating humans with this deficiency.
0171: Pig lungs from genetically modified pigs are being considered for transplantation into humans.
0172: Animals have been engineered to grow faster, be healthier and resist diseases.
0173: A GM pig called Enviropig was created with the capability of digesting plant phosphorus more efficiently than conventional pigs.
0174: This could potentially benefit mothers who cannot produce breast milk but want their children to have breast milk rather than formula.
0175: Plants cannot continue the natural ripening or aging process.
0176: The specialty of processing food by ionizing radiation is the fact, that the energy density per atomic transition is very high, it can cleave molecules and induce ionization (hence the name) which cannot be achieved by mere heating.
0177: However, the use of the term, cold pasteurization, to describe irradiated foods is controversial, because pasteurization and irradiation are fundamentally different processes, although the intended end results can in some cases be similar.
0178: Marie Curie died from aplastic anemia which resulted from her high levels of exposure.
0179: Approximately half of the deaths from Hiroshima and Nagasaki died two to five years afterward from radiation exposure.
0180: A nuclear meltdown refers to the more serious hazard of releasing nuclear material into the surrounding environment.
0181: In the Anglo-American world, anti-imperialism and pluralism began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.
0182: This was the time of Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser, and the victories of Mao Zedong in China and Fidel Castro in Cuba, as well as the events of May 1968, led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the New Left.
0183: Colonialism and racism were important issues that arose.
0184: The rise of feminism, LGBT social movements and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as African Americans and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, postcolonial, and multicultural thought becoming significant.
0185: Rawls used a thought experiment, the original position, in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance.
0186: Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe, several new lines of philosophy directed at the critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s.
0187: The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered.
0188: Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers.
0189: The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a polynomial, and thus form a real closed field that contains the real algebraic numbers.
0190: One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers.
0191: The number system that results depends on what base is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a prime number base provides the best mathematical properties.
0192: The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size.
0193: Following Gish's 1993 death, the University raised funds to enlarge its gallery to display memorabilia received from Gish's estate.
0194: The association between herself and D. W. Griffith was so close that some suspected a romantic connection, an issue never acknowledged by Gish, although several of their associates were certain they were at least briefly involved.
0195: In the 1920s, Gish's association with Duell became something of a tabloid scandal when he sued her and made the details of their relationship public.
0196: George Jean Nathan praised Gish's acting glowingly—comparing her to Eleonora Duse.
0197: During the period of political turmoil in the US that lasted from the outbreak of World War II in Europe until the attack on Pearl Harbor, she maintained an outspoken non-interventionist stance.
0198: Joseph Frank Keaton (October 4, 1895 – February 1, 1966), known professionally as Buster Keaton, was an American actor, comedian, film director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer.
0199: Therefore, after a couple generations these languages may no longer be spoken.
0200: To follow best practices of documentation, these records should be clearly annotated and kept safe within an archive of some kind.
0201: Language revitalization is the practice of bringing a language back into common use.
0202: The course aims to educate indigenous and non-indigenous students about the Lenape language and culture.
0203: Encouraging those who already know the language to use it, increasing the domains of usage, and increasing the overall prestige of the language are all components of reclamation.
0204: Social anthropology is the study of patterns of behaviour in human societies and cultures.
0205: While researchers practice techniques specific to molecular biology, it is common to combine these with methods from genetics and biochemistry.
0206: Biological systematics is the study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time.
0207: Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits (e.g., anatomical or molecular characteristics) and the distribution of organisms (biogeography).
0208: Biological systematics classifies species by using three specific branches.
0209: Experimental systematics identifies and classifies animals based on the evolutionary units that comprise a species, as well as their importance in evolution itself.
0210: Explaining the biodiversity of the planet and its organisms.
0211: The planets were formed 4.6 billion years ago in the protoplanetary disk that surrounded the early Sun.
0212: The planets continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many impact craters on the Moon.
0213: This process can form a stony or metallic core, surrounded by a mantle and an outer crust.
0214: Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics.
0215: Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of a vast amount of observational astrophysical data.
0216: Cosmochemistry is the study of the chemicals found within the Solar System, including the origins of the elements and variations in the isotope ratios.
0217: There have been suggestions that genetic engineering could be used to bring animals back from extinction.
0218: It has been used to treat genetic disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency, and Leber's congenital amaurosis.
0219: Germline gene therapy results in any change being inheritable, which has raised concerns within the scientific community.
0220: Aquaculture is a growing industry, currently providing over half the consumed fish worldwide.
0221: Several groups have been developing zebrafish to detect pollution by attaching fluorescent proteins to genes activated by the presence of pollutants.
0222: It was originally developed by one of the groups to detect pollution, but is now part of the ornamental fish trade, becoming the first genetically modified animal to become publicly available as a pet when in 2003 it was introduced for sale in the USA.
0223: Military reactors that experienced similar accidents were Windscale in the United Kingdom and SL-1 in the United States.
0224: Another topic of transhumanist research is how to protect humanity against existential risks, such as nuclear war or asteroid collision.
0225: The assertion would lay the intellectual groundwork for the British philosopher Max More to begin articulating the principles of transhumanism as a futurist philosophy in 1990, and organizing in California a school of thought that has since grown into the worldwide transhumanist movement.
0226: In the Discourse, Descartes envisioned a new kind of medicine that could grant both physical immortality and stronger minds.
0227: St. Leon may have provided inspiration for his daughter Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein.
0228: In particular, he was interested in the development of the science of eugenics, ectogenesis (creating and sustaining life in an artificial environment), and the application of genetics to improve human characteristics, such as health and intelligence.
0229: Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on structuralism and on a "return to Hegel".
0230: Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by Michael Walzer, Michael Sandel and Charles Taylor.
0231: Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of social capital.
0232: A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are republicanism (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the capability approach.
0233: To a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable.
0234: Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced.
0235: This standard basis makes the complex numbers a Cartesian plane, called the complex plane.
0236: The complex numbers of absolute value one form the unit circle.
0237: In domain coloring the output dimensions are represented by color and brightness, respectively.
0238: Work on the problem of general polynomials ultimately led to the fundamental theorem of algebra, which shows that with complex numbers, a solution exists to every polynomial equation of degree one or higher.
0239: Wessel's memoir appeared in the Proceedings of the Copenhagen Academy but went largely unnoticed.
0240: Later classical writers on the general theory include Richard Dedekind, Otto Hölder, Felix Klein, Henri Poincaré, Hermann Schwarz, Karl Weierstrass and many others.
0241: His career declined when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and lost his artistic independence.
0242: Many of Keaton's films from the 1920s remain highly regarded, such as Sherlock Jr. (1924), The General (1926), and The Cameraman (1928).
0243: His father was Joseph Hallie "Joe" Keaton, who owned a traveling show with Harry Houdini called the Mohawk Indian Medicine Company, or the Keaton Houdini Medicine Show Company, which performed on stage and sold patent medicine on the side.
0244: In Keaton's retelling, he was six months old when the incident occurred, and Harry Houdini gave him the nickname.
0245: The act was mainly a comedy sketch.
0246: A suitcase handle was sewn into Keaton's clothing to aid with the constant tossing.
0247: British and American anthropologists including Gillian Tett and Karen Ho who studied Wall Street provided an alternative explanation for the financial crisis of 2007–2010 to the technical explanations rooted in economic and political theory.
0248: This development was bolstered by Franz Boas's introduction of cultural relativism arguing that cultures are based on different ideas about the world and can therefore only be properly understood in terms of their own standards and values.
0249: In 1906, Congolese pygmy Ota Benga was put by American anthropologist Madison Grant in a cage in the Bronx Zoo, labelled "the missing link" between an orangutan and the "white race" — Grant, a renowned eugenicist, was also the author of The Passing of the Great Race (1916).
0250: Anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the 19th century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form - by 1935, for example, it was possible for T.K. Penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled A Hundred Years of Anthropology.
0251: Non-European societies were thus seen as evolutionary "living fossils" that could be studied in order to understand the European past.
0252: However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and he generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural change proposed by later anthropologists.
0253: Taxonomy is that part of Systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above.
0254: However, in modern usage, they can all be considered synonyms of each other.
0255: Some claim systematics alone deals specifically with relationships through time, and that it can be synonymous with phylogenetics, broadly dealing with the inferred hierarchy of organisms.
0256: Scientific classifications are aids in recording and reporting information to other scientists and to laymen.
0257: In biology, a species is the basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank of an organism, as well as a unit of biodiversity.
0258: In addition, paleontologists use the concept of the chronospecies since fossil reproduction cannot be examined.
0259: Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky.
0260: Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum.
0261: A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).
0262: Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.
0263: A deeper understanding of the formation of stars and planets is needed.
0264: If so, what is the explanation for the Fermi paradox?
0265: Zebrafish are model organisms for developmental processes, regeneration, genetics, behaviour, disease mechanisms and toxicity testing.
0266: GM fish have been developed with promoters driving an over-production of growth hormone for use in the aquaculture industry to increase the speed of development and potentially reduce fishing pressure on wild stocks.
0267: It obtained regulatory approval in 2015, the first non-plant GMO food to be commercialized.
0268: Drosophila have been used to study genetics and inheritance, embryonic development, learning, behavior, and aging.
0269: Malaria-resistant mosquitoes have been developed in the laboratory by inserting a gene that reduces the development of the malaria parasite and then use homing endonucleases to rapidly spread that gene throughout the male population (known as a gene drive).
0270: Another approach is to use a sterile insect technique, whereby males genetically engineered to be sterile out compete viable males, to reduce population numbers.
0271: These ideas have been common transhumanist themes ever since.
0272: In the Material and Man section of the manifesto, Noboru Kawazoe suggests that:After several decades, with the rapid progress of communication technology, every one will have a "brain wave receiver" in his ear, which conveys directly and exactly what other people think about him and vice versa.
0273: In 1966, FM-2030 (formerly F. M. Esfandiary), a futurist who taught "new concepts of the human" at The New School, in New York City, began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles and world views transitional to posthumanity as "transhuman".
0274: FM-2030 and Vita-More soon began holding gatherings for transhumanists in Los Angeles, which included students from FM-2030's courses and audiences from Vita-More's artistic productions.
0275: A particular concern is the equal access to human enhancement technologies across classes and borders.
0276: This left the World Transhumanist Association as the leading international transhumanist organization.
0277: Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the polis (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals.
0278: Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.
0279: Chomsky is a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media.
0280: William E. Connolly: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of Pluralism and agonistic democracy.
0281: Thomas Hill Green: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of positive freedom.
0282: His early work was heavily influenced by the Frankfurt School.
0283: The use of imaginary numbers was not widely accepted until the work of Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855).
0284: The integers form the smallest group and the smallest ring containing the natural numbers.
0285: It is the prototype of all objects of such algebraic structure.
0286: Fixed length integer approximation data types (or subsets) are denoted int or Integer in several programming languages (such as Algol68, C, Java, Delphi, etc.).
0287: These are provable properties of rational numbers and positional number systems, and are not used as definitions in mathematics.
0288: Since the triangle is isosceles, a = b).
0289: However, Buster was always able to show the authorities that he had no bruises or broken bones.
0290: Several times I'd have been killed if I hadn't been able to land like a cat.
0291: Noticing that this caused the audience to laugh less, he adopted his famous deadpan expression when performing.
0292: Despite tangles with the law and a disastrous tour of music halls in the United Kingdom, Keaton was a rising star in the theater.
0293: In February 1917, he met Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle at the Talmadge Studios in New York City, where Arbuckle was under contract to Joseph M. Schenck.
0294: Buster was such a natural in his first film, The Butcher Boy, he was hired on the spot.
0295: His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of The Golden Bough, analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally.
0296: The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description.
0297: Other intellectual founders include W. H. R. Rivers and A. C. Haddon, whose orientation reflected the contemporary Parapsychologies of Wilhelm Wundt and Adolf Bastian, and Sir E. B. Tylor, who defined anthropology as a positivist science following Auguste Comte.
0298: A. R. Radcliffe-Brown also published a seminal work in 1922.
0299: This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for "Social Anthropology" by teaching at universities across the British Empire and Commonwealth.
0300: He believed that indigenous terms used in ethnographic data should be translated into Anglo-American legal terms for the benefit of the reader.
0301: All species (except viruses) are given a two-part name, a "binomial".
0302: For example, Boa constrictor is one of four species of the genus Boa, with constrictor being the species's epithet.
0303: Also, among organisms that reproduce only asexually, the concept of a reproductive species breaks down, and each clone is potentially a microspecies.
0304: Species were seen from the time of Aristotle until the 18th century as fixed categories that could be arranged in a hierarchy, the great chain of being.
0305: That understanding was greatly extended in the 20th century through genetics and population ecology.
0306: Ernst Mayr emphasised reproductive isolation, but this, like other species concepts, is hard or even impossible to test.
0307: What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy?
0308: How did the first galaxies form?
0309: Astrobiology, formerly known as exobiology, is an interdisciplinary scientific field that studies the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe.
0310: The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology.
0311: Biochemistry may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the Universe was only 10–17 million years old.
0312: Nonetheless, Earth is the only place in the universe humans know to harbor life.
0313: The approach is similar to the sterile technique tested on mosquitoes, where males are transformed with a gene that prevents any females born from reaching maturity.
0314: In this case a strain of pink bollworm that were sterilized with radiation were genetically engineered to express a red fluorescent protein making it easier for researchers to monitor them.
0315: There is also potential to use the silk producing machinery to make other valuable proteins.
0316: A GM chicken that produces the drug Kanuma, an enzyme that treats a rare condition, in its egg passed US regulatory approval in 2015.
0317: There are proposals to use genetic engineering to control cane toads in Australia.
0318: It is also relatively easy to produce stable transgenic nematodes and this along with RNAi are the major tools used in studying their genes.
0319: The Mormon Transhumanist Association was founded in 2006.
0320: Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective, including sometimes the creation of a highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement (i.e. biological uplift), but clings to a "posthuman future" as the final goal of participant evolution.
0321: While such a "cultural posthumanism" would offer resources for rethinking the relationships between humans and increasingly sophisticated machines, transhumanism and similar posthumanisms are, in this view, not abandoning obsolete concepts of the "autonomous liberal subject", but are expanding its "prerogatives" into the realm of the posthuman.
0322: However, other progressives have argued that posthumanism, whether it be its philosophical or activist forms, amounts to a shift away from concerns about social justice, from the reform of human institutions and from other Enlightenment preoccupations, toward narcissistic longings for a transcendence of the human body in quest of more exquisite ways of being.
0323: Many transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and innovative social systems to improve the quality of all life, while seeking to make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of legal and political equality by eliminating congenital mental and physical barriers.
0324: Some theorists such as Ray Kurzweil think that the pace of technological innovation is accelerating and that the next 50 years may yield not only radical technological advances, but possibly a technological singularity, which may fundamentally change the nature of human beings.
0325: He advocated free-market capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the rule of law and let spontaneous order develop.
0326: David Hume: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement.
0327: Most famous for the United States Declaration of Independence.
0328: Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.
0329: He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property.
0330: One of the founders of Western Marxism.
0331: Since c is even, dividing c by 2 yields an integer.
0332: Substituting 4y2 for c2 in the first equation (c2 = 2b2) gives us 4y2= 2b2.
0333: Since b2 is even, b must be even.
0334: However this contradicts the assumption that they have no common factors.
0335: Hippasus, however, was not lauded for his efforts: according to one legend, he made his discovery while out at sea, and was subsequently thrown overboard by his fellow Pythagoreans “…for having produced an element in the universe which denied the…doctrine that all phenomena in the universe can be reduced to whole numbers and their ratios.”
0336: For example, consider a line segment: this segment can be split in half, that half split in half, the half of the half in half, and so on.
0337: Keaton later claimed that he was soon Arbuckle's second director and his entire gag department.
0338: It was based on a successful play, The New Henrietta, which had already been filmed once, under the title The Lamb, with Douglas Fairbanks playing the lead.
0339: He made a series of two-reel comedies, including One Week (1920), The Playhouse (1921), Cops (1922), and The Electric House (1922).
0340: Comedy director Leo McCarey, recalling the freewheeling days of making slapstick comedies, said, "All of us tried to steal each other's gagmen.
0341: During the railroad water-tank scene in Sherlock Jr., Keaton broke his neck when a torrent of water fell on him from a water tower, but he did not realize it until years afterward.
0342: Keaton's character emerged unscathed, due to a single open window.
0343: Departments of Social Anthropology at different Universities have tended to focus on disparate aspects of the field.
0344: A people is any plurality of persons considered as a whole.
0345: Four states — Massachusetts, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky — refer to themselves as the Commonwealth in case captions and legal process.
0346: In some parts of the world, ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and pedagogical doctrine, with cultural anthropology becoming dominant especially in the United States, and social anthropology in Great Britain.
0347: The 15th-century exploration of America by European explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the Occident (the Western world), such as the notion of the "Other".
0348: The progress of ethnology, for example with Claude Lévi-Strauss's structural anthropology, led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear progress, or the pseudo-opposition between "societies with histories" and "societies without histories", judged too dependent on a limited view of history as constituted by accumulative growth.
0349: This method was used as a "classical" method of determining species, such as with Linnaeus early in evolutionary theory.
0350: As a rule of thumb, microbiologists have assumed that kinds of Bacteria or Archaea with 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences more similar than 97% to each other need to be checked by DNA-DNA hybridisation to decide if they belong to the same species or not.
0351: Modern approaches compare sequence similarity using computational methods.
0352: A database, Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), contains DNA barcode sequences from over 190,000 species.
0353: For example, in a study done on fungi, studying the nucleotide characters using cladistic species produced the most accurate results in recognising the numerous fungi species of all the concepts studied.
0354: Yet others defend this approach, considering "taxonomic inflation" pejorative and labelling the opposing view as "taxonomic conservatism"; claiming it is politically expedient to split species and recognise smaller populations at the species level, because this means they can more easily be included as endangered in the IUCN red list and can attract conservation legislation and funding.
0355: The term exobiology was coined by molecular biologist and Nobel Prize winner Joshua Lederberg.
0356: The term xenobiology is now used in a more specialized sense, to mean "biology based on foreign chemistry", whether of extraterrestrial or terrestrial (possibly synthetic) origin.
0357: Though once considered outside the mainstream of scientific inquiry, astrobiology has become a formalized field of study.
0358: In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded an Exobiology Program, which is now one of four main elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program.
0359: Advancements in the fields of astrobiology, observational astronomy and discovery of large varieties of extremophiles with extraordinary capability to thrive in the harshest environments on Earth, have led to speculation that life may possibly be thriving on many of the extraterrestrial bodies in the universe.
0360: Missions specifically designed to search for current life on Mars were the Viking program and Beagle 2 probes.
0361: Transgenic nematodes have been used to study viruses, toxicology, diseases, and to detect environmental pollutants.
0362: Flatworms have the ability to regenerate themselves from a single cell.
0363: The bristle worm, a marine annelid, has been modified.
0364: The development of a regulatory framework concerning genetic engineering began in 1975, at Asilomar, California.
0365: It is an international treaty that governs the transfer, handling, and use of genetically modified organisms.
0366: Many experiments also need permission from a national regulatory group or legislation.
0367: For example, Bostrom has written extensively on existential risks to humanity's future welfare, including ones that could be created by emerging technologies.
0368: To counter this, Hawking emphasizes either self-design of the human genome or mechanical enhancement (e.g., brain-computer interface) to enhance human intelligence and reduce aggression, without which he implies human civilization may be too stupid collectively to survive an increasingly unstable system, resulting in societal collapse.
0369: These thinkers argue that the ability to discuss in a falsification-based way constitutes a threshold that is not arbitrary at which it becomes possible for an individual to speak for themselves in a way that is not dependent on exterior assumptions.
0370: In keeping with this, many prominent transhumanist advocates, such as Dan Agin, refer to transhumanism's critics, on the political right and left jointly, as "bioconservatives" or "bioluddites", the latter term alluding to the 19th century anti-industrialisation social movement that opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines.
0371: The same scenario happens when people have certain neural implants that give them an advantage in the work place and in educational aspects.
0372: Immortalism, a moral ideology based upon the belief that radical life extension and technological immortality is possible and desirable, and advocating research and development to ensure its realization.
0373: Gave an account of statecraft in a realistic point of view instead of relying on idealism.
0374: As a political theorist, he believed in separation of powers and proposed a comprehensive set of checks and balances that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the tyranny of the majority.
0375: Introduced the concept of "repressive desublimation", in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire.
0376: Created the concept of ideology in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions.
0377: Mencius: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.
0378: Montesquieu: Analyzed protection of the people by a "balance of powers" in the divisions of a state.
0379: This is just what Zeno sought to prove.
0380: In the minds of the Greeks, disproving the validity of one view did not necessarily prove the validity of another, and therefore further investigation had to occur.
0381: A magnitude “...was not a number but stood for entities such as line segments, angles, areas, volumes, and time which could vary, as we would say, continuously.
0382: Because no quantitative values were assigned to magnitudes, Eudoxus was then able to account for both commensurable and incommensurable ratios by defining a ratio in terms of its magnitude, and proportion as an equality between two ratios.
0383: This incommensurability is dealt with in Euclid's Elements, Book X, Proposition 9.
0384: In fact, in many cases algebraic conceptions were reformulated into geometric terms.
0385: Aside from Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928), Keaton's most enduring feature-length films include Our Hospitality (1923), The Navigator (1924), Sherlock Jr. (1924), Seven Chances (1925), The Cameraman (1928), and The General (1926).
0386: Though it would come to be regarded as Keaton's greatest achievement, the film received mixed reviews at the time.
0387: His distributor, United Artists, insisted on a production manager who monitored expenses and interfered with certain story elements.
0388: The actors would phonetically memorize the foreign-language scripts a few lines at a time and shoot immediately after.
0389: The director was usually Jules White, whose emphasis on slapstick and farce made most of these films resemble White's famous Three Stooges shorts.
0390: However, director White's insistence on blunt, violent gags resulted in the Columbia shorts being the least inventive comedies he made.
0391: However, the claims of such cultural universalism have been criticized by various 19th- and 20th-century social thinkers, including Marx, Nietzsche, Foucault, Derrida, Althusser, and Deleuze.
0392: An ethnic group or ethnicity is a grouping of people who identify with each other on the basis of shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups such as a common set of traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or social treatment within their residing area.
0393: Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language, or dialect, symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art, or physical appearance.
0394: By way of language shift, acculturation, adoption and religious conversion, individuals or groups may over time shift from one ethnic group to another.
0395: Whether through division or amalgamation, the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as ethnogenesis.
0396: In Early Modern English and until the mid-19th century, ethnic was used to mean heathen or pagan (in the sense of disparate "nations" which did not yet participate in the Christian oikumene), as the Septuagint used ta ethne ("the nations") to translate the Hebrew goyim "the nations, non-Hebrews, non-Jews".
0397: If scientists mean that something applies to all species within a genus, they use the genus name without the specific name or epithet.
0398: As further information comes to hand, the hypothesis may be corroborated or refuted.
0399: Dividing a taxon into multiple, often new, taxa is called splitting.
0400: The term quasispecies is sometimes used for rapidly mutating entities like viruses.
0401: In ring species, when members of adjacent populations in a widely continuous distribution range interbreed successfully but members of more distant populations do not.
0402: Ring species thus present a difficulty for any species concept that relies on reproductive isolation.
0403: In late 2008, the Phoenix lander probed the environment for past and present planetary habitability of microbial life on Mars, and researched the history of water there.
0404: In November 2011, NASA launched the Mars Science Laboratory mission carrying the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars at Gale Crater in August 2012.
0405: One is the informed assumption that the vast majority of life forms in our galaxy are based on carbon chemistries, as are all life forms on Earth.
0406: The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of extremely long and complex molecules.
0407: A third assumption is to focus on planets orbiting Sun-like stars for increased probabilities of planetary habitability.
0408: To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and ESA's Darwin programs, both of which have been cancelled.
0409: There is a near-universal system for assessing the relative risks associated with GMOs and other agents to laboratory staff and the community.
0410: Different countries use different nomenclature to describe the levels and can have different requirements for what can be done at each level.
0411: For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.
0412: Most countries that do not allow GMO cultivation do permit research using GMOs.
0413: While only a few GMOs have been approved for cultivation in the EU a number of GMOs have been approved for import and processing.
0414: The US policy does not focus on the process as much as other countries, looks at verifiable scientific risks and uses the concept of substantial equivalence.
0415: Mathematics (from Greek: ) includes the study of such topics as quantity (number theory), structure (algebra), space (geometry), and change (analysis).
0416: When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature.
0417: The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.
0418: Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.
0419: As evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time—days, seasons, or years.
0420: Beginning in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans, with Greek mathematics the Ancient Greeks began a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right.
0421: His interpreters have debated the content of his political philosophy.
0422: Plato: Wrote a lengthy dialog The Republic in which he laid out his political philosophy: citizens should be divided into three categories.
0423: Ayn Rand: Founder of Objectivism and prime mover of the Objectivist and Libertarian movements in mid-twentieth-century America.
0424: The government was to be separated from economics the same way and for the same reasons it was separated from religion.
0425: Adam Smith: Often said to have founded modern economics; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior ("the invisible hand") of artisans and traders.
0426: Socrates: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.
0427: The realization that some basic conception within the existing theory was at odds with reality necessitated a complete and thorough investigation of the axioms and assumptions that underlie that theory.
0428: However, historian Carl Benjamin Boyer writes that "such claims are not well substantiated and unlikely to be true".
0429: Mathematicians like Brahmagupta (in 628 AD) and Bhāskara I (in 629 AD) made contributions in this area as did other mathematicians who followed.
0430: The year 1872 saw the publication of the theories of Karl Weierstrass (by his pupil Ernst Kossak), Eduard Heine (Crelle's Journal, 74), Georg Cantor (Annalen, 5), and Richard Dedekind.
0431: Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a cut (Schnitt) in the system of all rational numbers, separating them into two groups having certain characteristic properties.
0432: Dirichlet also added to the general theory, as have numerous contributors to the applications of the subject.
0433: He made his last starring feature El Moderno Barba Azul (1946) in Mexico; the film was a low-budget production, and it may not have been seen in the United States until its release on VHS in the 1980s, under the title Boom in the Moon.
0434: In In the Good Old Summertime, Keaton personally directed the stars Judy Garland and Van Johnson in their first scene together, where they bump into each other on the street.
0435: Reaction was strong enough for a local Los Angeles station to offer Keaton his own show, also broadcast live, in 1950.
0436: Buster Keaton's wife Eleanor also was seen in the series (notably as Juliet to Buster's Romeo in a little-theater vignette).
0437: Keaton's periodic television appearances during the 1950s and 1960s helped to revive interest in his silent films.
0438: Well into his fifties, Keaton successfully recreated his old routines, including one stunt in which he propped one foot onto a table, then swung the second foot up next to it and held the awkward position in midair for a moment before crashing to the stage floor.
0439: In the 19th century, the term came to be used in the sense of "peculiar to a race, people or nation", in a return to the original Greek meaning.
0440: ethnic, a. and n.") Depending on context, the term nationality may be used either synonymously with ethnicity or synonymously with citizenship (in a sovereign state).
0441: Whether ethnicity qualifies as a cultural universal is to some extent dependent on the exact definition used.
0442: According to Thomas Hylland Eriksen, the study of ethnicity was dominated by two distinct debates until recently.
0443: The instrumentalist approach, on the other hand, treats ethnicity primarily as an ad hoc element of a political strategy, used as a resource for interest groups for achieving secondary goals such as, for instance, an increase in wealth, power, or status.
0444: Constructivists view national and ethnic identities as the product of historical forces, often recent, even when the identities are presented as old.
0445: Speciation depends on a measure of reproductive isolation, a reduced gene flow.
0446: Bacteria can exchange plasmids with bacteria of other species, including some apparently distantly related ones in different phylogenetic domains, making analysis of their relationships difficult, and weakening the concept of a bacterial species.
0447: Mass extinctions had a variety of causes including volcanic activity, climate change, and changes in oceanic and atmospheric chemistry, and they in turn had major effects on Earth's ecology, atmosphere, land surface and waters.
0448: Some observers claim that there is an inherent conflict between the desire to understand the processes of speciation and the need to identify and to categorise.
0449: One of the classic cases in North America is that of the protected northern spotted owl which hybridises with the unprotected California spotted owl and the barred owl; this has led to legal debates.
0450: A form was distinguished by being shared by all its members, the young inheriting any variations they might have from their parents.
0451: Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference, but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or pseudoscientific arguments.
0452: The discovery of extremophiles, organisms able to survive in extreme environments, became a core research element for astrobiologists, as they are important to understand four areas in the limits of life in planetary context: the potential for panspermia, forward contamination due to human exploration ventures, planetary colonization by humans, and the exploration of extinct and extant extraterrestrial life.
0453: Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was thought to obtain its nourishment either from consuming organic detritus rained down from the surface waters or from eating animals that did.
0454: This chemosynthesis revolutionized the study of biology and astrobiology by revealing that life need not be sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.
0455: Ten hardy organisms selected for the LIFE project, by Amir Alexander Deinococcus radiodurans, Bacillus subtilis, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana ('mouse-ear cress'), as well as the invertebrate animal Tardigrade.
0456: Jupiter's moon, Europa, and Saturn's moon, Enceladus, are now considered the most likely locations for extant extraterrestrial life in the Solar System due to their subsurface water oceans where radiogenic and tidal heating enables liquid water to exist.
0457: One of the key issues concerning regulators is whether GM products should be labeled.
0458: The dispute involves consumers, producers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, non-governmental organizations, and scientists.
0459: Most concerns are around the health and environmental effects of GMOs.
0460: Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe.
0461: Gene flow between GM crops and compatible plants, along with increased use of broad-spectrum herbicides, can increase the risk of herbicide resistant weed populations.
0462: In order to address some of these concerns some GMOs have been developed with traits to help control their spread.
0463: The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be Archimedes (c. 287–212 BC) of Syracuse.
0464: The Hindu–Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western world via Islamic mathematics.
0465: The most notable achievement of Islamic mathematics was the development of algebra.
0466: During the early modern period, mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in Western Europe.
0467: Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who made numerous contributions to fields such as algebra, analysis, differential geometry, matrix theory, number theory, and statistics.
0468: Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today.
0469: Max Stirner: Important thinker within anarchism and the main representative of the anarchist current known as individualist anarchism.
0470: Other forms of social philosophy include political philosophy and jurisprudence, which are largely concerned with the societies of state and government and their functioning.
0471: Pre-Socratic philosophy, also known as early Greek philosophy, is ancient Greek philosophy before Socrates.
0472: Their work and writing has been almost entirely lost.
0473: Pre-Socratic philosophy began in the 6th century BCE with the three Milesians: Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes.
0474: Xenophanes is known for his critique of the anthropomorphism of gods.
0475: This asserts that every integer has a unique factorization into primes.
0476: To show this, suppose we divide integers n by m (where m is nonzero).
0477: If 0 never occurs, then the algorithm can run at most m − 1 steps without using any remainder more than once.
0478: In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting (as in "there are six coins on the table") and ordering (as in "this is the third largest city in the country").
0479: These chains of extensions make the natural numbers canonically embedded (identified) in the other number systems.
0480: The first major advance in abstraction was the use of numerals to represent numbers.
