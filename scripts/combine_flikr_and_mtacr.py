# NOTE: Just added a new script to merge the initially collected flikr30k entries with our mtacr-collected entries,
#       just to realize, that I must have done that in the past already... Whoops!
#       Also renamed some of the files, which might result in some older scripts requiring some changes... Whoopsie!
#       â†’ Original flikr30k entries and our mtacr-collected data are together in /data/alignments_mtacr_flikr30k.json
